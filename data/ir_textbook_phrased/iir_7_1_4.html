static quality scores and ordering static quality scores static 21 the net score for a document is some combination of together with the query-dependent score induced (say) by (27) . the precise combination may be determined by the learning-methods of section 6.1.2 , to be developed further in section 15.4.1 ; but for the purposes of our exposition here , let us consider a simple sum : (35) 24 first , consider ordering the documents in the postings list for each term by decreasing value of . this allows us to perform the postings intersection algorithm of figure 1.6 . in order to perform the intersection by a single pass through the postings of each query-term , the algorithm of figure 1.6 relied on the postings being ordered by document ids . but in fact , we only required that all postings be ordered by a single common ordering ; here we rely on the values to provide this common ordering . this is illustrated in figure 7.2 , where the postings are ordered in decreasing order of . a static quality-ordered index.in this example we assume that doc1 , doc2 and doc3 respectively have static quality scores . the first idea is a direct extension of champion lists : for a well-chosen value , we maintain for each term a global champion list of the documents with the highest values for . the list itself is , like all the postings lists considered so far , sorted by a common order (either by document ids or by static quality) . then at query time , we only compute the net scores (35) for documents in the union of these global champion lists . intuitively , this has the effect of focusing on documents likely to have large net scores . we conclude the discussion of global champion lists with one further idea . we maintain for each term two postings lists consisting of disjoint sets of documents , each sorted by values . the first list , which we call high , contains the documents with the highest tf values for . the second list , which we call low , contains all other documents containing . when processing a query , we first scan only the high lists of the query terms , computing net scores for any document on the high lists of all (or more than a certain number of) query terms . if we obtain scores for documents in the process , we terminate . if not , we continue the scanning into the low lists , scoring documents in these postings lists . this idea is developed further in section 7.2.1 .
