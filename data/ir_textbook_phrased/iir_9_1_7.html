indirect relevance-feedback we can also use indirect sources of evidence rather than explicit-feedback on relevance as the basis for relevance-feedback . this is often called implicit (relevance) feedback . implicit-feedback is less reliable than explicit-feedback , but is more useful than pseudo-relevance-feedback , which contains no evidence of user judgments . moreover , while users are often reluctant to provide explicit-feedback , it is easy to collect implicit-feedback in large quantities for a high volume system , such as a web-search-engine . on the web , directhit introduced the idea of ranking more highly documents that users chose to look at more often . in other words , clicks on links were assumed to indicate that the page was likely relevant to the query . this approach makes various assumptions , such as that the document summaries displayed in results lists (on whose basis users choose which documents to click on) are indicative of the relevance of these documents . in the original directhit search-engine , the data about the click rates on pages was gathered globally , rather than being user or query specific . this is one form of the general area of clickstream-mining . today , a closely related approach is used in ranking the advertisements that match a web-search query (chapter 19) .
