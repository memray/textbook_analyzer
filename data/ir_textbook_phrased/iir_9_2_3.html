automatic-thesaurus-generation as an alternative to the cost of a manual thesaurus , we could attempt to generate a thesaurus automatically by analyzing a collection of documents . there are two main approaches . one is simply to exploit word cooccurrence . we say that words co-occurring in a document or paragraph are likely to be in some sense similar or related in meaning , and simply count text statistics to find the most similar words . the other approach is to use a shallow grammatical-analysis of the text and to exploit grammatical-relations or grammatical dependencies . for example , we say that entities that are grown , cooked , eaten , and digested , are more likely to be food items . simply using word cooccurrence is more robust (it can not be misled by parser errors) , but using grammatical-relations is more accurate . the simplest way to compute a co-occurrence thesaurus is based on term-term similarities . we begin with a term-document-matrix , where each cell is a weighted count for term and document , with weighting so has length-normalized rows . if we then calculate , then is a similarity-score between terms and , with a larger number being better . figure 9.8 shows an example of a thesaurus derived in basically this manner , but with an extra step of dimensionality-reduction via latent-semantic-indexing , which we discuss in chapter 18 . while some of the thesaurus terms are good or at least suggestive , others are marginal or bad . the quality of the associations is typically a problem . term ambiguity easily introduces irrelevant statistically correlated terms . for example , a query for apple computer may expand to apple red fruit computer . in general these thesauri suffer from both false-positives and false-negatives . moreover , since the terms in the automatic thesaurus are highly correlated in documents anyway (and often the collection used to derive the thesaurus is the same as the one being indexed) , this form of query-expansion may not retrieve many additional documents . query-expansion is often effective in increasing recall . however , there is a high cost to manually producing a thesaurus and then updating it for scientific and terminological developments within a field . in general a domain-specific-thesaurus is required : general thesauri and dictionaries give far too little coverage of the rich domain-particular vocabularies of most scientific fields . however , query-expansion may also significantly decrease precision , particularly when the query contains ambiguous terms . for example , if the user searches for interest rate , expanding the query to interest rate fascinate evaluate is unlikely to be useful . overall , query-expansion is less successful than relevance-feedback , though it may be as good as pseudo-relevance-feedback . it does , however , have the advantage of being much more understandable to the system user . exercises . if is simply a boolean cooccurrence matrix , then what do you get as the entries in ?
