a first take at building an inverted-index to gain the speed benefits of indexing at retrieval-time , we have to build the index in advance . the major steps in this are : collect the documents to be indexed : ... tokenize the text , turning each document into a list of tokens : ... do linguistic-preprocessing , producing a list of normalized tokens , which are the indexing terms : ... index the documents that each term occurs in by creating an inverted-index , consisting of a dictionary and postings . 2.2 tokens normalized tokens words sort-based indexing within a document-collection , we assume that each document has a unique serial number , known as the document identifier (docid) . during index-construction , we can simply assign successive integers to each new document when it is first encountered . the input to indexing is a list of normalized tokens for each document , which we can equally think of as a list of pairs of term and docid , as in figure 1.4 . the core indexing step is sorting this list so that the terms are alphabetical , giving us the representation in the middle column of figure 1.4 . multiple occurrences of the same term from the same document are then merged.instances of the same term are then grouped , and the result is split into a dictionary and postings , as shown in the right column of figure 1.4 . since a term generally occurs in a number of documents , this data-organization already reduces the storage requirements of the index . the dictionary also records some statistics , such as the number of documents which contain each term (the document frequency , which is here also the length of each postings list) . this information is not vital for a basic boolean search-engine , but it allows us to improve the efficiency of the search-engine at query time , and it is a statistic later used in many ranked-retrieval models . the postings are secondarily sorted by docid . this provides the basis for efficient-query-processing . this inverted-index structure is essentially without rivals as the most efficient structure for supporting ad-hoc text-search . in the resulting index , we pay for storage of both the dictionary and the postings lists . the latter are much larger , but the dictionary is commonly kept in memory , while postings lists are normally kept on disk , so the size of each is important , and in chapter 5 we will examine how each can be optimized for storage and access efficiency . what data-structure should be used for a postings list ? a fixed length array would be wasteful as some words occur in many documents , and others in very few . for an in-memory postings list , two good alternatives are singly linked-lists or variable-length arrays . singly linked-lists allow cheap insertion of documents into postings lists (following updates , such as when recrawling the-web for updated documents) , and naturally extend to more advanced indexing strategies such as skip-lists (section 2.3) , which require additional pointers . variable-length arrays win in space requirements by avoiding the overhead for pointers and in time requirements because their use of contiguous memory increases speed on modern processors with memory caches . extra pointers can in practice be encoded into the lists as offsets . if updates are relatively infrequent , variable-length arrays will be more compact and faster to traverse . we can also use a hybrid-scheme with a linked-list of fixed length arrays for each term . when postings lists are stored on disk , they are stored (perhaps compressed) as a contiguous run of postings without explicit pointers (as in figure 1.3) , so as to minimize the size of the postings list and the number of disk seeks to read a postings list into memory . exercises . draw the inverted-index that would be built for the following document-collection .
