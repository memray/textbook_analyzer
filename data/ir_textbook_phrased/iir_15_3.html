issues in the classification of text-documents there are lots of applications of text-classification in the commercial world ; email-spam-filtering is perhaps now the most ubiquitous . jackson and moulinier (2002) write : `` there is no question concerning the commercial value of being able to classify documents automatically by content . there are myriad potential applications of such a capability for corporate intranets , government departments , and internet publishers . '' most of our discussion of classification has focused on introducing various machine-learning-methods rather than discussing particular features of text-documents relevant to classification . this bias is appropriate for a textbook , but is misplaced for an application developer . it is frequently the case that greater performance gains can be achieved from exploiting domain-specific text features than from changing from one machine-learning method to another . jackson and moulinier (2002) suggest that `` understanding the data is one of the keys to successful categorization , yet this is an area in which most categorization tool vendors are extremely weak . many of the ` one size fits all ' tools on the market have not been tested on a wide range of content types . '' in this section we wish to step back a little and consider the applications of text-classification , the space of possible solutions , and the utility of application-specific heuristics . subsections choosing what kind of classifier to use improving classifier-performance large and difficult category taxonomies features for text-document zones in text-classification upweighting document zones . separate feature spaces for document zones . connections to text-summarization .
