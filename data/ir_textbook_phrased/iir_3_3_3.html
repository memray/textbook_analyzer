edit-distance edit-distance edit operations levenshtein-distance 3.4 it is well-known how to compute the (weighted) edit-distance between two strings in time , where denotes the length of a string . the idea is to use the dynamic-programming-algorithm in figure 3.5 , where the characters in and are given in array form . the algorithm fills the (integer) entries in a matrix whose two dimensions equal the lengths of the two strings whose edit distances is being computed ; the entry of the-matrix will hold (after the algorithm is executed) the edit-distance between the strings consisting of the first characters of and the first characters of . the central dynamic-programming step is depicted in lines 8-10 of figure 3.5 , where the three quantities whose minimum is taken correspond to substituting a character in , inserting a character in and inserting a character in . figure 3.5 : dynamic-programming-algorithm for computing the edit-distance between strings and . figure 3.6 shows an example levenshtein-distance computation of figure 3.5 . the typical cell has four entries formatted as a cell . the lower right entry in each cell is the of the other three , corresponding to the main dynamic-programming step in figure 3.5 . the other three entries are the three entries or 1 depending on whether and . the cells with numbers in italics depict the path by which we determine the levenshtein-distance . the spelling-correction problem however demands more than computing edit-distance : given a set of strings (corresponding to terms in the vocabulary) and a query string , we seek the string (s) in of least edit-distance from . we may view this as a decoding-problem , in which the codewords (the strings in) are prescribed in advance . the obvious way of doing this is to compute the edit-distance from to each string in , before selecting the string (s) of minimum edit-distance . this exhaustive-search is inordinately expensive . accordingly , a number of heuristics are used in practice to efficiently retrieve vocabulary terms likely to have low edit-distance to the query-term (s) . the simplest such heuristic is to restrict the search to dictionary terms beginning with the same letter as the query string ; the hope would be that spelling errors do not occur in the first character of the query . a more sophisticated variant of this heuristic is to use a version of the permuterm index , in which we omit the end-of-word symbol $ . consider the set of all rotations of the query string . for each rotation from this set , we traverse the b-tree into the permuterm index , thereby retrieving all dictionary terms that have a rotation beginning with . for instance , if is mase and we consider the rotation , we would retrieve dictionary terms such as semantic and semaphore that do not have a small edit-distance to . unfortunately , we would miss more pertinent dictionary terms such as mare and mane . to address this , we refine this rotation scheme : for each rotation , we omit a suffix of characters before performing the b-tree traversal . this ensures that each term in the set of terms retrieved from the dictionary includes a `` long '' substring in common with . the value of could depend on the length of . alternatively , we may set it to a fixed constant such as .
