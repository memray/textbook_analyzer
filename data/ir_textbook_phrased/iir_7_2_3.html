designing parsing and scoring-functions free-text queries the answer of course depends on the user population , the query-distribution and the collection of documents . typically , a query parser is used to translate the user-specified keywords into a query with various operators that is executed against the underlying indexes . sometimes , this execution can entail multiple-queries against the underlying indexes ; for example , the query parser may issue a stream of queries : run the user-generated query string as a phrase-query . rank them by vector-space scoring using as query the vector consisting of the 3 terms rising interest rates . if fewer than ten documents contain the phrase rising interest rates , run the two 2-term phrase queries rising interest and interest rates ; rank these using vector-space scoring , as well . if we still have fewer than ten results , run the vector-space query consisting of the three individual query terms . accumulates evidence the answer depends on the setting . in many enterprise settings we have application-builders who make use of a toolkit of available scoring operators , along with a query-parsing layer , with which to manually configure the scoring-function as well as the query parser . such application-builders make use of the available zones , metadata and knowledge of typical documents and queries to tune the parsing and scoring . in collections whose characteristics change infrequently (in an enterprise-application , significant changes in collection and query characteristics typically happen with infrequent events such as the introduction of new document-formats or document-management-systems , or a merger with another company) . web-search on the other hand is faced with a constantly changing document-collection with new characteristics being introduced all the time . it is also a setting in which the number of scoring factors can run into the hundreds , making hand-tuned scoring a difficult exercise . to address this , it is becoming increasingly common to use machine-learned scoring , extending the ideas we introduced in section 6.1.2 , as will be discussed further in section 15.4.1 .
