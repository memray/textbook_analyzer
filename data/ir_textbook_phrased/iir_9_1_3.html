when does relevance-feedback work ? the success of relevance-feedback depends on certain assumptions . firstly , the user has to have sufficient knowledge to be able to make an initial query which is at least somewhere close to the documents they desire . this is needed anyhow for successful information-retrieval in the basic case , but it is important to see the kinds of problems that relevance-feedback can not solve alone . cases where relevance-feedback alone is not sufficient include : misspellings . if the user spells a term in a different way to the way it is spelled in any document in the collection , then relevance-feedback is unlikely to be effective . this can be addressed by the spelling-correction techniques of chapter 3 . cross-language-information-retrieval . documents in another language are not nearby in a vector-space based on term-distribution . rather , documents in the same language cluster more closely together . mismatch of searcher 's vocabulary versus collection vocabulary . if the user searches for laptop but all the documents use the term notebook-computer , then the query will fail , and relevance-feedback is again most likely ineffective . secondly , the relevance-feedback approach requires relevant documents to be similar to each other . that is , they should cluster . ideally , the term-distribution in all relevant documents will be similar to that in the documents marked by the users , while the term-distribution in all nonrelevant documents will be different from those in relevant documents . things will work well if all relevant documents are tightly clustered around a single prototype , or , at least , if there are different prototypes , if the relevant documents have significant vocabulary overlap , while similarities between relevant and nonrelevant documents are small . implicitly , the rocchio relevance-feedback model treats relevant documents as a single cluster , which it models via the centroid of the cluster . this approach does not work as well if the relevant documents are a multimodal class , that is , they consist of several clusters of documents within the vector-space . this can happen with : subsets of the documents using different vocabulary , such as burma vs. myanmar a query for which the answer set is inherently disjunctive , such as pop stars who once worked at burger king . instances of a general concept , which often appear as a disjunction of more specific concepts , for example , felines . relevance-feedback is not necessarily popular with users . users are often reluctant to provide explicit-feedback , or in general do not wish to prolong the search interaction . furthermore , it is often harder to understand why a particular document was retrieved after relevance-feedback is applied . relevance-feedback can also have practical-problems . the long queries that are generated by straightforward application of relevance-feedback techniques are inefficient for a typical ir-system . this results in a high computing cost for the retrieval and potentially long response-times for the user . a partial solution to this is to only reweight certain prominent terms in the relevant documents , such as perhaps the top 20 terms by term-frequency . some experimental-results have also suggested that using a limited number of terms like this may give better results (harman , 1992) though other work has suggested that using more terms is better in terms of retrieved document-quality (buckley et al. , 1994b) .
