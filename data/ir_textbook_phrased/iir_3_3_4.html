k-gram indexes for spelling-correction to further limit the set of vocabulary terms for which we compute edit distances to the query-term , we now show how to invoke the - gram index of section 3.2.2 (page) to assist with retrieving vocabulary terms with low edit-distance to the query . once we retrieve such terms , we can then find the ones of least edit-distance from . in fact , we will use the - gram index to retrieve vocabulary terms that have many - grams in common with the query . we will argue that for reasonable definitions of `` many - grams in common , '' the retrieval-process is essentially that of a single scan through the postings for the - grams in the query string . figure : matching at least two of the three 2-grams in the query bord . the 2-gram (or bigram) index in figure 3.7 shows (a portion of) the postings for the three bigrams in the query bord . suppose we wanted to retrieve vocabulary terms that contained at least two of these three bigrams . a single scan of the postings (much as in chapter 1) would let us enumerate all such terms ; in the example of figure 3.7 we would enumerate aboard , boardroom and border . this straightforward application of the linear-scan intersection of postings immediately reveals the shortcoming of simply requiring matched vocabulary terms to contain a fixed number of - grams from the query : terms like boardroom , an implausible `` correction '' of bord , get enumerated . consequently , we require more nuanced measures of the overlap in - grams between a vocabulary term and . the linear-scan intersection can be adapted when the measure of overlap is the jaccard-coefficient for measuring the overlap between two sets and , defined to be . the two sets we consider are the set of - grams in the query , and the set of - grams in a vocabulary term . as the scan proceeds , we proceed from one vocabulary term to the next , computing on-the-fly the jaccard-coefficient between and . if the coefficient exceeds a preset threshold , we add to the output ; if not , we move on to the next term in the postings . to compute the jaccard-coefficient , we need the set of - grams in and . since we are scanning the postings for all - grams in , we immediately have these - grams on hand . what about the - grams of ? in principle , we could enumerate these on-the-fly from ; in practice this is not only slow but potentially infeasible since , in all likelihood , the postings entries themselves do not contain the complete string but rather some encoding of . the crucial observation is that to compute the jaccard-coefficient , we only need the length of the string . to see this , recall the example of figure 3.7 and consider the point when the postings scan for query bord reaches term boardroom . we know that two bigrams match . if the postings stored the (pre-computed) number of bigrams in boardroom (namely , 8) , we have all the information we require to compute the jaccard-coefficient to be ; the numerator is obtained from the number of postings hits (2 , from bo and rd) while the denominator is the sum of the number of bigrams in bord and boardroom , less the number of postings hits . we could replace the jaccard-coefficient by other measures that allow efficient on-the-fly computation during postings scans . how do we use these for spelling-correction ? one method that has some empirical support is to first use the - gram index to enumerate a set of candidate vocabulary terms that are potential corrections of . we then compute the edit-distance from to each term in this set , selecting terms from the set with small edit-distance to .
