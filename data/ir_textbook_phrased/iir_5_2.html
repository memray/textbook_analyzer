dictionary-compression this section presents a series of dictionary-data structures that achieve increasingly higher compression ratios . the dictionary is small compared with the postings file as suggested by table 5.1 . so why compress it if it is responsible for only a small percentage of the overall space requirements of the ir-system ? one of the primary factors in determining the response-time of an ir-system is the number of disk seeks necessary to process a query . if parts of the dictionary are on disk , then many more disk seeks are necessary in query-evaluation . thus , the main goal of compressing the dictionary is to fit it in main-memory , or at least a large portion of it , to support high query throughput . although dictionaries of very-large collections fit into the memory of a standard desktop machine , this is not true of many other application-scenarios . for example , an enterprise-search server for a large corporation may have to index a multiterabyte collection with a comparatively large vocabulary because of the presence of documents in many different languages . we also want to be able to design search systems for limited hardware such as mobile-phones and onboard computers . other reasons for wanting to conserve memory are fast startup-time and having to share resources with other applications . the search-system on your pc must get along with the memory-hogging word-processing suite you are using at the same time . figure 5.3 : storing the dictionary as an array of fixed-width entries . subsections dictionary as a string blocked storage
