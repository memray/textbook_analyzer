1.2.2 logical view of the documents due to historical reasons , documents in a collection are frequently represented through a set of index-terms or keywords . such keywords might be extracted directly from the text of the document or might be specified by a human subject (as frequently done in the information-sciences arena) . no matter whether these representative keywords are derived automatically or generated by a specialist , they provide a logical view of the document for a precise definition of the concept of a document and its characteristics , see chapter 6 . modern computers are making it possible to represent a document by its full set of words . in this case , we say that the retrieval-system adopts a full text logical view (or representation) of the documents . with very-large collections , however , even modern computers might have to reduce the set of representative keywords . this can be accomplished through the elimination of stopwords (such as articles and connectives) , the use of stemming (which reduces distinct words to their common grammatical root) , and the identification of noun-groups (which eliminates adjectives , adverbs , and verbs) . further , compression might be employed . these operations are called text operations (or transformations) and are covered in detail in chapter 7 . text operations reduce the complexity of the document representation and allow moving the logical view from that of a full text to that of a set of index-terms . the full text is clearly the most complete logical view of a document but its usage usually implies higher computational costs . a small set of categories (generated by a human specialist) provides the most concise logical view of a document but its usage might lead to retrieval of poor quality . several intermediate logical-views (of a document) might be adopted by an information-retrieval-system as illustrated in figure 1.2 . besides adopting any of the intermediate-representations , the retrieval-system might also recognize the internal-structure normally present in a document (e.g. , chapters , sections , subsections , etc.) . this introduction figure 1.2 logical view of a document : from full text to a set of index-terms . information on the structure of the document might be quite useful and is required by structured-text retrieval-models such as those discussed in chapter 2 . as illustrated in figure 1.2 , we view the issue of logically representing a document as a continuum in which the logical view of a document might shift (smoothly) from a full text representation to a higher level representation specified by a human subject .
