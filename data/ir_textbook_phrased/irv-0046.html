clustered files it is now common practice to refer to a file processed by a clustering-algorithm as a clustered file , and to refer to the resulting structure as a file-structure . for example salton [34] (p. 288) lists a clustered file as an alternative organisation to inverted , serial , chained files , etc. . although it may be convenient terminologically , it does disguise the real status of cluster methods . cluster methods (or automatic-classification methods) are more profitably discussed at the level of abstraction at which relations are discussed in connection with data-bases , that is , in a thoroughly data independent way . in other words , selecting an appropriate cluster method and implementing it are two separate problems . unfortunately not all users of clustering-techniques see it this way , and so the current scene is rather confused . one factor contributing to the confusion is that clustering-techniques have been used at a very low level of implementation of system-software , for example , to reduce the number of page exceptions in a virtual-memory . therefore , those who use clustering merely to increase retrieval-efficiency (in terms of storage and speed) will tend to see a classification structure as a file-structure , whereas those who see clustering as a means of discovering (or summarising) some inherent structure in the data will look upon the same structure as a description of the data . of course , this description may be used to achieve more efficient retrieval (and in ir more effective retrieval in terms of say precision-and-recall) . furthermore , if one looks carefully at some of the implementations of cluster methods one discovers that the classificatory system is represented inside the computer by one of the more conventional file-structures .
