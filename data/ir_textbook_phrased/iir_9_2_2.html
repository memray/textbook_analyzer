query-expansion an example of query-expansion in the interface of the yahoo! web-search-engine in 2006 . the expanded query-suggestions appear just below the `` search-results '' bar . in relevance-feedback , users give additional input on documents (by marking documents in the results set as relevant or not) , and this input is used to reweight the terms in the query for documents . in query-expansion on the other hand , users give additional input on query words or phrases , possibly suggesting additional query terms . some search-engines (especially on the web) suggest related queries in response to a query ; the users then opt to use one of these alternative query-suggestions . figure 9.6 shows an example of query-suggestion options being presented in the yahoo! web-search-engine . the central question in this form of query-expansion is how to generate alternative or expanded queries for the user . the most common form of query-expansion is global-analysis , using some form of thesaurus . for each term in a query , the query can be automatically expanded with synonyms and related words of from the thesaurus . use of a thesaurus can be combined with ideas of term-weighting : for instance , one might weight added terms less than original query terms . methods for building a thesaurus for query-expansion include : use of a controlled-vocabulary that is maintained by human editors . here , there is a canonical term for each concept . the subject-headings of traditional library subject indexes , such as the library-of-congress subject-headings , or the dewey decimal system are examples of a controlled-vocabulary . use of a controlled-vocabulary is quite common for well-resourced domains . a well-known example is the unified-medical-language-system (umls) used with medline for querying the biomedical-research literature . for example , in figure 9.7 , neoplasms was added to a search for cancer . this medline query-expansion also contrasts with the yahoo! example . the yahoo! interface is a case of interactive-query-expansion , whereas pubmed does automatic-query-expansion . unless the user chooses to examine the submitted query , they may not even realize that query-expansion has occurred . a manual thesaurus . here , human editors have built up sets of synonymous names for concepts , without designating a canonical term . the umls metathesaurus is one example of a thesaurus . statistics canada maintains a thesaurus of preferred terms , synonyms , broader terms , and narrower terms for matters on which the government collects statistics , such as goods and services . this thesaurus is also bilingual english and french . an automatically derived thesaurus . here , word-co-occurrence statistics over a collection of documents in a domain are used to automatically induce a thesaurus ; see section 9.2.3 . query-reformulations based on query-log-mining . here , we exploit the manual query reformulations of other users to make suggestions to a new-user . this requires a huge query volume , and is thus particularly appropriate to web-search .
