term-frequency and weighting free-text query 1.4 towards this end , we assign to each term in a document a weight for that term , that depends on the number of occurrences of the term in the document . we would like to compute a score between a query-term and a document , based on the weight of in . the simplest approach is to assign the weight to be equal to the number of occurrences of term in document . this weighting-scheme is referred to as term-frequency and is denoted , with the subscripts denoting the term and the document in order . for a document , the set of weights determined by the weights above (or indeed any weighting-function that maps the number of occurrences of in to a positive-real value) may be viewed as a quantitative digest of that document . in this view of a document , known in the literature as the bag-of-words-model , the exact ordering of the terms in a document is ignored but the number of occurrences of each term is material (in contrast to boolean-retrieval) . we only retain information on the number of occurrences of each term . thus , the document `` mary is quicker than john '' is , in this view , identical to the document `` john is quicker than mary '' . nevertheless , it seems intuitive that two documents with similar bag-of-words representations are similar in content . we will develop this intuition further in section 6.3 . before doing so we first study the question : are all words in a document equally important ? clearly not ; in section 2.2.2 (page) we looked at the idea of stop words - words that we decide not to index at all , and therefore do not contribute in any way to retrieval and scoring . subsections inverse-document-frequency tf-idf-weighting
