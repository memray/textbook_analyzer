the extended boolean-model versus ranked-retrieval the boolean-retrieval model contrasts with ranked-retrieval models such as the vector-space-model (section 6.3) , in which users largely use free-text queries , that is , just typing one or more words rather than using a precise language with operators for building up query expressions , and the system decides which documents best satisfy the query . despite decades of academic-research on the advantages of ranked-retrieval , systems implementing the boolean-retrieval model were the main or only search option provided by large commercial information providers for three decades until the early 1990s (approximately the date of arrival of the world-wide-web) . however , these systems did not have just the basic boolean-operations (and , or , and not) which we have presented so far . a strict boolean-expression over terms with an unordered results set is too limited for many of the information-needs that people have , and these systems implemented extended boolean-retrieval models by incorporating additional operators such as term-proximity operators . a proximity operator is a way of specifying that two terms in a query must occur close to each other in a document , where closeness may be measured by limiting the allowed number of intervening words or by reference to a structural unit such as a sentence or paragraph . worked example . commercial boolean searching : westlaw.westlaw westlaw (http://www.westlaw.com/) is the largest commercial legal search-service (in terms of the number of paying subscribers) , with over half a million subscribers performing millions of searches a day over tens of terabytes of text-data . the service was started in 1975 . in 2005 , boolean search (called `` terms and connectors '' by westlaw) was still the default , and used by a large percentage of users , although ranked free-text querying (called `` natural-language '' by westlaw) was added in 1992 . here are some example boolean-queries on westlaw : information-need : information on the legal theories involved in preventing the disclosure of trade secrets by employees formerly employed by a competing company . query : `` trade-secret '' / s disclos ! / s prevent / s employe ! information-need : requirements for disabled-people to be able to access a workplace . query : disab ! / p access ! / s work-site work-place (employment / 3 place) information-need : cases about a host 's responsibility for drunk guests . query : host ! / p (responsib ! liab !) / p (intoxicat ! drunk !) / p guest note the long , precise queries and the use of proximity operators , both uncommon in web-search . submitted queries average about ten words in length . unlike web-search conventions , a space between words represents disjunction (the tightest binding operator) , is and and / s , / p , and / ask for matches in the same sentence , same paragraph or within words respectively . double quotes give a phrase search (consecutive words) ; see section 2.4 (page) . the exclamation mark (!) gives a trailing wildcard query wildcard ; thus liab ! matches all words starting with liab . additionally work-site matches any of worksite , work-site or work site ; see section 2.2.1 (page) . typical expert queries are usually carefully defined and incrementally developed until they obtain what look to be good results to the user . many users , particularly professionals , prefer boolean-query models . boolean-queries are precise : a document either matches the query or it does not . this offers the user greater control and transparency over what is retrieved . and some domains , such as legal materials , allow an effective means of document-ranking within a boolean-model : westlaw returns documents in reverse chronological order , which is in practice quite effective . in 2007 , the majority of law librarians still seem to recommend terms and connectors for high recall searches , and the majority of legal users think they are getting greater control by using them . however , this does not mean that boolean-queries are more effective for professional searchers . indeed , experimenting on a westlaw subcollection , turtle (1994) found that free-text queries produced better results than boolean-queries prepared by westlaw 's own reference librarians for the majority of the information-needs in his experiments . a general problem with boolean search is that using and operators tends to produce high precision but low recall searches , while using or operators gives low precision but high recall searches , and it is difficult or impossible to find a satisfactory middle ground . end worked example . in this chapter , we have looked at the structure and construction of a basic inverted-index , comprising a dictionary and postings lists . we introduced the boolean-retrieval model , and examined how to do efficient retrieval via linear-time merges and simple query-optimization . in dictionaryranking-ir-system we will consider in detail richer query-models and the sort of augmented index-structures that are needed to handle them efficiently . here we just mention a few of the main additional things we would like to be able to do : we would like to better determine the set of terms in the dictionary and to provide retrieval that is tolerant to spelling mistakes and inconsistent choice of words . it is often useful to search for compounds or phrases that denote a concept such as `` operating-system '' . as the westlaw examples show , we might also wish to do proximity-queries such as gates near microsoft . to answer such queries , the index has to be augmented to capture the proximities of terms in documents . a boolean-model only records term presence or absence , but often we would like to accumulate evidence , giving more weight to documents that have a term several times as opposed to ones that contain it only once . to be able to do this we need term-frequency information (the number of times a term occurs in a document) in postings lists . boolean-queries just retrieve a set of matching documents , but commonly we wish to have an effective method to order (or `` rank '') the returned results . this requires having a mechanism for determining a document score which encapsulates how good a match a document is for a query . with these additional ideas , we will have seen most of the basic technology that supports ad-hoc searching over unstructured-information . ad-hoc searching over documents has recently conquered the world , powering not only web-search-engines but the kind of unstructured search that lies behind the large ecommerce websites . although the main web-search-engines differ by emphasizing free-text querying , most of the basic issues and technologies of indexing and querying remain the same , as we will see in later chapters . moreover , over time , web-search-engines have added at least partial implementations of some of the most popular operators from extended boolean models : phrase search is especially popular and most have a very partial implementation of boolean-operators . nevertheless , while these options are liked by expert searchers , they are little used by most people and are not the main focus in work on trying to improve web-search-engine performance . exercises . write a query using westlaw syntax which would find any of the words professor , teacher , or lecturer in the same sentence as a form of the verb explain . try using the boolean search features on a couple of major web-search-engines . for instance , choose a word , such as burglar , and submit the queries (i) burglar , (ii) burglar and burglar , and (iii) burglar or burglar . look at the estimated number of results and top hits . do they make sense in terms of boolean-logic ? often they have n't for major search-engines . can you make sense of what is going on ? what about if you try different words ? for example , query for (i) knight , (ii) conquer , and then (iii) knight or conquer . what bound should the number of results from the first two queries place on the third query ? is this bound observed ?
