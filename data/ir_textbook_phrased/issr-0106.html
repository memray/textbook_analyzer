7.7 summary creating the index to an information-retrieval-system defines the searchable concepts that represent the items received by a system . the user-search process is the mechanism that correlates the user 's search statement with the index via a similarity-function . there are a number of techniques to define the indexes to an item . it is typically more efficient to incur system overhead at index creation time than search-time . an item is processed once at index time , but there will be millions of searches against the index . also , the user is directly affected by the response-time of a search but , in general , is not aware of how long it takes from receipt of an item to its being available in the index . the selection and implementation of similarity algorithms for search must be optimized for performance and scaleable to accommodate very-large-databases . it is typical during search parsing that the user 's initial search statement is expanded via a thesaurus or semantic-net to account for vocabulary differences between the user and the authors . but excessive expansion takes significantly more processing and increases the response-time due to the number of terms that have to be processed . most systems have default limits on the number of new terms added to a search statement . chapter 7 describes some of the basic algorithms that can be used as similarity-measures . these algorithms are still in a state of evolution and are continually being modified to improve their performance . the search-algorithms in a probabilistic indexing and search-system are much more complex than the similarity-measures described . for systems based upon natural-language-processing , once the initial similarity comparisons are completed , there is an additional search processing step to make use of discourse-level information , adding additional precision to the final results . relevance-feedback is an alternative to thesaurus-expansion to assist the user in creating a search statement that will return the needed information . thesaurus and semantic-net expansions are dependent upon the user 's ability to use the appropriate vocabulary in the search statement that represents the required information . if the user selects poor terms , they will be expanded with many more poor terms . thesaurus-expansion does not introduce new concepts that are relevant to the users information-need , it just expands the description of existing concepts . relevance-feedback starts with the text of an item that the user has identified as meeting his information-need ; incorporating it into a revised search user search-techniques 195 statement . the vocabulary in the relevant item text has the potential for introducing new concepts that better reflect the user 's information-need along with adding additional terms related to existing search-terms and adjusting the weights (importance) of existing terms . selective-dissemination-of-information search is different from searches against the persistent information database in that it is assumed there is no information from a large-corpus available to determine parameters in determining a temporary index for the item to use in the similarity comparison process (e.g. , inverse-document-frequency factors .) an aspect of dissemination systems that helps in the search-process is the tendency for the profiles to have significantly more terms than ad-hoc queries . the additional-information helps to identify relevant items and increase the precision of the search-process . relevance-feedback can also be used with profiles with some constraints . relevance-feedback used with ad-hoc queries against an existing database tends to move the terminology defining the search concepts towards the information-need of the user that is available in the current database . concepts in the initial search statement will eventually lose importance in the revised queries if they are not in the database . the goal of profiles is to define the coverage of concepts that the user cares about if they are ever found in new items . relevance-feedback applied to profiles aides the user by enhancing the search profile with new terminology about areas-of-interest . but , even though a concept has not been found in any items received , that area may still be of critical importance to the user if it ever is found in any new items . thus weighting of original terms takes on added significance over the ad-hoc situation . searching the-internet for information has brought into focus the deficiencies in the search-algorithms developed to date . the ad-hoc queries are extremely short (usually less than three terms) and most users do not know how to use the advanced features associated with most search sites . until recently research had focused on a larger more sophisticated query . with the-internet being the largest most available information-system supporting information-retrieval search , algorithms are in the process of being modified to account for the lack of information provided by the users in their queries . intelligent-agents are being proposed as a potential mechanism to assist users in locating the information they require . the requirements for autonomy and the need for reasoning in the agents will lead to the merging of information-retrieval algorithms and the learning-processes associated with artificial-intelligence . the use of hyperlinks is adding another level of ambiguity in what should be defined as an item . when similarity-measures are being applied to identify the relevance weight , how much of the hyperlinked information should be considered part of the item ? the impacts on the definition of information-retrieval boundaries are just starting to be analyzed while experimental products are being developed in web years and immediately being made available .
