General wildcard queries Next: Permuterm indexes Up: Wildcard queries Previous: Wildcard queries   Contents   Index General wildcard queries We now study two techniques for handling general wildcard queries. Both techniques share a common strategy: express the given wildcard query as a Boolean query on a specially constructed index, such that the answer to is a superset of the set of vocabulary terms matching . Then, we check each term in the answer to against , discarding those vocabulary terms that do not match . At this point we have the vocabulary terms matching and can resort to the standard inverted index.
