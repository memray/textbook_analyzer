We first compute for the data in Example 13.5.1:  (134)   (135)    We compute the other in the same way:                                Plugging these values into Equation 133, we get a value of 284:     (136)   End worked example. is a measure of how much expected counts and observed counts deviate from each other. A high value of indicates that the hypothesis of independence, which implies that expected and observed counts are similar, is incorrect. In our example, . Based on Table 13.6 , we can reject the hypothesis that poultry and export are independent with only a 0.001 chance of being wrong.Equivalently, we say that the outcome is statistically significant at the 0.001 level. If the two events are dependent, then the occurrence of the term makes the occurrence of the class more likely (or less likely), so it should be helpful as a feature. This is the rationale of feature selection.   Table 13.6: Critical values of the distribution with one degree of freedom. For example, if the two events are independent, then . So for the assumption of independence can be rejected with 99% confidence.   critical value     0.1 2.71     0.05 3.84     0.01 6.63     0.005 7.88     0.001 10.83    An arithmetically simpler way of computing is the following: (137)  133 13.6   Subsections Assessing as a feature selection methodAssessing chi-square as a feature selection method
