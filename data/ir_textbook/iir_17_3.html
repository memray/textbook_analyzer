To judge the coherence of , we need to look at all document-document similarities within , including those that occur within and those that occur within . We can compute the measure SIM-GA efficiently because the sum of individual vector similarities is equal to the similarities of their sums:     (204)    (205)         SIM FFICIENT 17.8 205 Equation 204 relies on the distributivity of the dot product with respect to vector addition. Since this is crucial for the efficient computation of a GAAC clustering, the method cannot be easily applied to representations of documents that are not real-valued vectors. Also, Equation 204 only holds for the dot product. While many algorithms introduced in this book have near-equivalent descriptions in terms of dot product, cosine similarity and Euclidean distance (cf. simdisfigs), Equation 204 can only be expressed using the dot product. This is a fundamental difference between single-link/complete-link clustering and GAAC. The first two only require a square matrix of similarities as input and do not care how these similarities were computed. To summarize, GAAC requires (i) documents represented as vectors, (ii) length normalization of vectors, so that self-similarities are 1.0, and (iii) the dot product as the measure of similarity between vectors and sums of vectors. The merge algorithms for GAAC and complete-link clustering are the same except that we use Equation 205 as similarity function in Figure 17.8 . Therefore, the overall time complexity of GAAC is the same as for complete-link clustering: . Like complete-link clustering, GAAC is not best-merge persistent (Exercise 17.10 ). This means that there is no algorithm for GAAC that would be analogous to the algorithm for single-link in Figure 17.9 . We can also define group-average similarity as including self-similarities:     (206)    139 139   Self-similarities are always equal to 1.0, the maximum possible value for length-normalized vectors. The proportion of self-similarities in Equation 206 is for a cluster of size . This gives an unfair advantage to small clusters since they will have proportionally more self-similarities. For two documents , with a similarity , we have . In contrast, . This similarity of two documents is the same as in single-link, complete-link and centroid clustering. We prefer the definition in Equation 205, which excludes self-similarities from the average, because we do not want to penalize large clusters for their smaller proportion of self-similarities and because we want a consistent similarity value for document pairs in all four HAC algorithms. Exercises. Apply group-average clustering to the points in and 17.7 . Map them onto the surface of the unit sphere in a three-dimensional space to get length-normalized vectors. Is the group-average clustering different from the single-link and complete-link clusterings?
