The Product Property of Square Roots In our work with simplifying square root expressions, we noted that Since this is an equation, we may write it as To multiply two square root expressions, we use the product property of square roots. The Product Property The product of the square roots is the square root of the product. In practice, it is usually easier to simplify the square root expressions before actually performing the multiplication. To see this, consider the following product: We can multiply these square roots in either of two ways: Example 9.27.  Simplify then multiply. Example 9.28.  Multiply then simplify. Notice that in the second method, the expanded term (the third expression, ) may be difficult to factor into a perfect square and some other number.
