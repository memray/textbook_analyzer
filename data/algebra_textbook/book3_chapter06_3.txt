 || Product of a monomial and a binomial: Distributive Law Example: ab(2a + 1) = ab(2a) + ab(1) = 2a2b + ab  || Product of two binomials: FOIL (First-Outer-Inner-Last) Because the situation of a binomial times a binomial is so common, it helps to use a quick mnemonic device to help remember all the products. This is called the FOIL method. Example: 1.      The F stands for first, which means the x in the first factor times the x in the second factor 2.      The O stands for outer, which means the x in the first factor times the 3 in the second factor 3.      The I stands for inner, which means the 2 in the first factor times the x in the second factor 4.      The L stands for last, which means the 2 in the first factor times the 3 in the second factor ·        Of course you would then combine the 3x + 2x into a 5x, because they are like terms, so the final result is  ||
