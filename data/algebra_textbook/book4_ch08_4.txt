 || The Distributive Property Distributive Property The distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both addition and multiplication. It is used often in algebra, and we can use it now to obtain exact results for a multiplication. Suppose we wish to compute 3(2 + 5). We can proceed in either of two ways, one way which is known to us already (the order of operations), and a new way (the distributive property). Compute 3(2 + 5) using the order of operations. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) Operate inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 Now multiply 3 and 7. 3 ( 2 + 5 ) = 3 ⋅ 7 = 21 Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Compute 3(2 + 5) using the distributive property. We know that multiplication describes repeated addition. Thus, Thus, 3(2 + 5) = 21. Let's look again at this use of the distributive property. The 3 has been distributed to the 2 and 5. This is the distributive property. We distribute the factor to each addend in the parentheses. The distributive property works for both sums and differences.

The distributive property works best for products when one of the factors ends in 0 or 5. We shall restrict our attention to only such products. Sample Set B Use the distributive property to compute each value. Example 8.19.  25 ⋅ 23 Notice that 23 = 20 + 3. We now write Thus, 25 ⋅ 23 = 575 We could have proceeded by writing 23 as 30 – 7. Example 8.20.  15 ⋅ 37 Notice that 37 = 30 + 7. We now write Thus, 15 ⋅ 37 = 555 We could have proceeded by writing 37 as 40 – 3. Example 8.21.  15 ⋅ 86 Notice that 86 = 80 + 6. We now write We could have proceeded by writing 86 as 90 – 4. Practice Set B Use the distributive property to compute each value. Exercise 8.4.8. (Go to Solution) 25 ⋅ 12 Exercise 8.4.9.
