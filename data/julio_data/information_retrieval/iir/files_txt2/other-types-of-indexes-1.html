Other types of indexes
 Other types of indexes In the indexes we have considered so far, postings lists are ordered with respect to docID. As we see in Chapter 5, this is advantageous for compression - instead of docIDs we can compress smaller gaps between IDs, thus reducing space requirements for the index. However, this structure for the index is not optimal when we build ranked (Chapters 6 7 ) - as opposed to Boolean - retrieval systems . In ranked retrieval, postings are often ordered according to weight or impact , with the highest-weighted postings occurring first. With this organization, scanning of long postings lists during query processing can usually be terminated early when weights have become so small that any further documents can be predicted to be of low similarity to the query (see Chapter 6 ). In a docID-sorted index, new documents are always inserted at the end of postings lists. In an impact-sorted index impactordered, the insertion can occur anywhere, thus complicating the update of the inverted index. Security is an important consideration for retrieval systems in corporations. A low-level employee should not be able to find the salary roster of the corporation, but authorized managers need to be able to search for it. Users' results lists must not contain documents they are barred from opening; the very existence of a document can be sensitive information.  Figure: A user-document matrix for access control lists. Element is 1 if user has access to document and 0 otherwise. During query processing, a user's access postings list is intersected with the results list returned by the text part of the index. User authorization is often mediated through access control lists or ACLs. ACLs can be dealt with in an information retrieval system by representing each document as the set of users that can access them (Figure 4.8 ) and then inverting the resulting user-document matrix. The inverted ACL index has, for each user, a ``postings list'' of documents they can access - the user's access list. Search results are then intersected with this list. However, such an index is difficult to maintain when access permissions change - we discussed these difficulties in the context of incremental indexing for regular postings lists in Section 4.5. It also requires the processing of very long postings lists for users with access to large document subsets. User membership is therefore often verified by retrieving access information directly from the file system at query time - even though this slows down retrieval. We discussed indexes for storing and retrieving terms (as opposed to documents) in Chapter 3 . Exercises. Can spelling correction compromise document-level security? Consider the case where a spelling correction is based on documents to which the user does not have access. Exercises. Total index construction time in blocked sort-based indexing is broken down in Table 4.3. Fill out the time column of the table for Reuters-RCV1 assuming a system with the parameters given in Table 4.1 .

Choose a block size that is realistic for current technology (remember that a block should easily fit into main memory). How many blocks do you need? Assume that we have a collection of modest size whose index can be constructed with the simple in-memory indexing algorithm in Figure 1.4 (page ). For this collection, compare memory, disk and time requirements of the simple algorithm in Figure 1.4 and blocked sort-based indexing. Assume that machines in MapReduce have 100 GB of disk space each. Assume further that the postings list of the term the has a size of 200 GB. Then the MapReduce algorithm as described cannot be run to construct the index. How would you modify MapReduce so that it can handle this case? For optimal load balancing, the inverters in MapReduce must get segmented postings files of similar sizes. For a new collection, the distribution of key-value pairs may not be known in advance. How would you solve this problem? Apply MapReduce to the problem of counting how often each term occurs in a set of files. Specify map and reduce operations for this task. Write down an example along the lines of Figure 4.6 . We claimed (on page 4.5 ) that an auxiliary index can impair the quality of collection statistics. An example is the term weighting method idf , which is defined as where is the total number of documents and is the number of documents that term occurs in idf. Show that even a small auxiliary index can cause significant error in idf when it is computed on the main index only. Consider a rare term that suddenly occurs frequently (e.g., Flossie as in Tropical Storm Flossie).
