Machine learning methods in ad hoc information retrieval
 Machine learning methods in ad hoc information retrieval Rather than coming up with term and document weighting functions by hand, as we primarily did in Chapter 6 , we can view different sources of relevance signal (cosine score, title match, etc.) as features in a learning problem. A classifier that has been fed examples of relevant and nonrelevant documents for each of a set of queries can then figure out the relative weights of these signals. If we configure the problem so that there are pairs of a document and a query which are assigned a relevance judgment of relevant or nonrelevant, then we can think of this problem too as a text classification problem. Taking such a classification approach is not necessarily best, and we present an alternative in Section 15.4.2 . Nevertheless, given the material we have covered, the simplest place to start is to approach this problem as a classification problem, by ordering the documents according to the confidence of a two-class classifier in its relevance decision. And this move is not purely pedagogical; exactly this approach is sometimes used in practice.   Subsections A simple example of machine-learned scoring Result ranking by machine learning
