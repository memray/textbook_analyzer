Spelling correction Next: Implementing spelling correction Up: Dictionaries and tolerant retrieval Previous: k-gram indexes for wildcard   Contents   Index Spelling correction We next look at the problem of correcting spelling errors in queries. For instance, we may wish to retrieve documents containing the term carrot when the user types the query carot. Google reports (http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html) that the following are all treated as misspellings of the query britney spears: britian spears, britney's spears, brandy spears and prittany spears. We look at two steps to solving this problem: the first based on edit distance and the second based on -gram overlap. Before getting into the algorithmic details of these methods, we first review how search engines provide spell-correction as part of a user experience.
