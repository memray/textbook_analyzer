The last 7 bits of a byte are ``payload'' and encode part of the gap. The first bit of the byte is a continuation bit . It is set to 1 for the last byte of the encoded gap and to 0 otherwise. To decode a variable byte code, we read a sequence of bytes with continuation bit 0 terminated by a byte with continuation bit 1. We then extract and concatenate the 7-bit parts. Figure 5.8 gives pseudocode for VB encoding and decoding and Table 5.4 an example of a VB-encoded postings list. With VB compression, the size of the compressed index for Reuters-RCV1 is 116 MB as we verified in an experiment. This is a more than 50% reduction of the size of the uncompressed index (see Table 5.6 ). The idea of VB encoding can also be applied to larger or smaller units than bytes: 32-bit words, 16-bit words, and 4-bit words or nibbles . Larger words further decrease the amount of bit manipulation necessary at the cost of less effective (or no) compression. Word sizes smaller than bytes get even better compression ratios at the cost of more bit manipulation. In general, bytes offer a good compromise between compression ratio and speed of decompression. For most IR systems variable byte codes offer an excellent tradeoff between time and space. They are also simple to implement - most of the alternatives referred to in Section 5.4 are more complex. But if disk space is a scarce resource, we can achieve better compression ratios by using bit-level encodings, in particular two closely related encodings: codes, which we will turn to next, and codes (Exercise 5.3.2 ).
