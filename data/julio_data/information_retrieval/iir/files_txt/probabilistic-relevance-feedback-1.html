One way of doing this is with a Naive Bayes probabilistic model. If is a Boolean indicator variable expressing the relevance of a document, then we can estimate , the probability of a term appearing in a document, depending on whether it is relevant or not, as: (50) (51) where is the total number of documents, is the number that contain , is the set of known relevant documents, and is the subset of this set containing . Even though the set of known relevant documents is a perhaps small subset of the true set of relevant documents, if we assume that the set of relevant documents is a small subset of the set of all documents then the estimates given above will be reasonable. This gives a basis for another way of changing the query term weights. We will discuss such probabilistic approaches more in Chapters 11 13 , and in particular outline the application to relevance feedback in Section 11.3.4 (page ). For the moment, observe that using just Equation 50 as a basis for term-weighting is likely insufficient. The equations use only collection statistics and information about the term distribution within the documents judged relevant. They preserve no memory of the original query.
