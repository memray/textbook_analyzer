These include: How fast does it index, that is, how many documents per hour does it index for a certain distribution over document lengths? (cf. Chapter 4 ) How fast does it search, that is, what is its latency as a function of index size? How expressive is its query language? How fast is it on complex queries? How large is its document collection, in terms of the number of documents or the collection having information distributed across a broad range of topics? All these criteria apart from query language expressiveness are straightforwardly measurable: we can quantify the speed or size. Various kinds of feature checklists can make query language expressiveness semi-precise. © 2008 Cambridge University Press This is an automatically generated page.
