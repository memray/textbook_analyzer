Choosing a document unit Next: Determining the vocabulary of Up: Document delineation and character Previous: Obtaining the character sequence   Contents   Index Choosing a document unit The next phase is to determine what the document unit for indexing is. Thus far we have assumed that documents are fixed units for the purposes of indexing. For example, we take each file in a folder as a document. But there are many cases in which you might want to do something different. A traditional Unix (mbox-format) email file stores a sequence of email messages (an email folder) in one file, but you might wish to regard each email message as a separate document. Many email messages now contain attached documents, and you might then want to regard the email message and each contained attachment as separate documents. If an email message has an attached zip file, you might want to decode the zip file and regard each file it contains as a separate document. Going in the opposite direction, various pieces of web software (such as latex2html) take things that you might regard as a single document (e.g., a Powerpoint file or a LATEX document) and split them into separate HTML pages for each slide or subsection, stored as separate files. In these cases, you might want to combine multiple files into a single document. More generally, for very long documents, the issue of indexing granularity arises. For a collection of books, it would usually be a bad idea to index an entire book as a document. A search for Chinese toys might bring up a book that mentions China in the first chapter and toys in the last chapter, but this does not make it relevant to the query. Instead, we may well wish to index each chapter or paragraph as a mini-document. Matches are then more likely to be relevant, and since the documents are smaller it will be much easier for the user to find the relevant passages in the document. But why stop there? We could treat individual sentences as mini-documents. It becomes clear that there is a precisionrecall tradeoff here. If the units get too small, we are likely to miss important passages because terms were distributed over several mini-documents, while if units are too large we tend to get spurious matches and the relevant information is hard for the user to find. The problems with large document units can be alleviated by use of explicit or implicit proximity search ( and 7.2.2 ), and the tradeoffs in resulting system performance that we are hinting at are discussed in Chapter 8 . The issue of index granularity, and in particular a need to simultaneously index documents at multiple levels of granularity, appears prominently in XML retrieval, and is taken up again in Chapter 10 . An IR system should be designed to offer choices of granularity. For this choice to be made well, the person who is deploying the system must have a good understanding of the document collection, the users, and their likely information needs and usage patterns. For now, we will henceforth assume that a suitable size document unit has been chosen, together with an appropriate way of dividing or aggregating files, if needed.
