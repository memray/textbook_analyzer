Champion lists Next: Static quality scores and Up: Efficient scoring and ranking Previous: Index elimination   Contents   Index Champion lists The idea of champion lists (sometimes also called fancy lists or top docs) is to precompute, for each term in the dictionary, the set of the documents with the highest weights for ; the value of is chosen in advance. For tf-idf weighting, these would be the documents with the highest tf values for term . We call this set of documents the champion list for term . Now, given a query we create a set as follows: we take the union of the champion lists for each of the terms comprising . We now restrict cosine computation to only the documents in . A critical parameter in this scheme is the value , which is highly application dependent. Intuitively, should be large compared with , especially if we use any form of the index elimination described in Section 7.1.2 . One issue here is that the value is set at the time of index construction, whereas is application dependent and may not be available until the query is received; as a result we may (as in the case of index elimination) find ourselves with a set that has fewer than documents. There is no reason to have the same value of for all terms in the dictionary; it could for instance be set to be higher for rarer terms.
