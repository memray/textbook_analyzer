Accordingly, there has been considerable research into variants of term frequency that go beyond counting the number of occurrences of a term. A common modification is to use instead the logarithm of the term frequency, which assigns a weight given by (28) In this form, we may replace by some other function as in (28), to obtain: (29) Equation (23) can then be modified by replacing tf-idf by wf-idf as defined in (29). © 2008 Cambridge University Press This is an automatically generated page.
