Scalable: The crawler architecture should permit scaling up the crawl rate by adding extra machines and bandwidth. Performance and efficiency: The crawl system should make efficient use of various system resources including processor, storage and network bandwidth. Quality: Given that a significant fraction of all web pages are of poor utility for serving user query needs, the crawler should be biased towards fetching ``useful'' pages first. Freshness: In many applications, the crawler should operate in continuous mode: it should obtain fresh copies of previously fetched pages. A search engine crawler, for instance, can thus ensure that the search engine's index contains a fairly current representation of each indexed web page. For such continuous crawling, a crawler should be able to crawl a page with a frequency that approximates the rate of change of that page. Extensible: Crawlers should be designed to be extensible in many ways - to cope with new data formats, new fetch protocols, and so on. This demands that the crawler architecture be modular.
