  <TITLE>Chapter 1 Boolean retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Boolean retrieval The meaning of the term information retrieval can be very broad. Just getting a credit card out of your wallet so that you can type in the card number is a form of information retrieval. However, as an academic field of study, information retrieval might be defined thus: Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers).   IR can also cover other kinds of data and information problems beyond that specified in the core definition above. The term ``unstructured data'' refers to data which does not have clear, semantically overt, easy-for-a-computer structure. It is the opposite of structured data, the canonical example of which is a relational database, of the sort companies usually use to maintain product inventories and personnel records. In reality, almost no data are truly ``unstructured''. This is definitely true of all text data if you count the latent linguistic structure of human languages. But even accepting that the intended notion of structure is overt structure, most text has structure, such as headings and paragraphs and footnotes, which is commonly represented in documents by explicit markup (such as the coding underlying web pages). IR is also used to facilitate ``semistructured'' search such as finding a document where the title contains Java and the body contains threading. The field of information retrieval also covers supporting users in browsing or filtering document collections or further processing a set of retrieved documents. Given a set of documents, clustering is the task of coming up with a good grouping of the documents based on their contents. It is similar to arranging books on a bookshelf according to their topic. Given a set of topics, standing information needs, or other categories (such as suitability of texts for different age groups), classification is the task of deciding which class(es), if any, each of a set of documents belongs to. It is often approached by first manually classifying some documents and then hoping to be able to classify new documents automatically. Information retrieval systems can also be distinguished by the scale at which they operate, and it is useful to distinguish three prominent scales. In web search , the system has to provide search over billions of documents stored on millions of computers. Distinctive issues are needing to gather documents for indexing, being able to build systems that work efficiently at this enormous scale, and handling particular aspects of the web, such as the exploitation of hypertext and not being fooled by site providers manipulating page content in an attempt to boost their search engine rankings, given the commercial importance of the web. We focus on all these issues in webcharlink. At the other extreme is personal information retrieval . In the last few years, consumer operating systems have integrated information retrieval (such as Apple's Mac OS X Spotlight or Windows Vista's Instant Search). Email programs usually not only provide search but also text classification: they at least provide a spam (junk mail) filter, and commonly also provide either manual or automatic means for classifying mail so that it can be placed directly into particular folders. Distinctive issues here include handling the broad range of document types on a typical personal computer, and making the search system maintenance free and sufficiently lightweight in terms of startup, processing, and disk space usage that it can run on one machine without annoying its owner. In between is the space of enterprise, institutional, and domain-specific search , where retrieval might be provided for collections such as a corporation's internal documents, a database of patents, or research articles on biochemistry. In this case, the documents will typically be stored on centralized file systems and one or a handful of dedicated machines will provide search over the collection. This book contains techniques of value over this whole spectrum, but our coverage of some aspects of parallel and distributed search in web-scale search systems is comparatively light owing to the relatively small published literature on the details of such systems. However, outside of a handful of web search companies, a software developer is most likely to encounter the personal search and enterprise scenarios. In this chapter we begin with a very simple example of an information retrieval problem, and introduce the idea of a term-document matrix (Section 1.1 ) and the central inverted index data structure (Section 1.2 ). We will then examine the Boolean retrieval model and how Boolean queries are processed ( and 1.4 ).

  <TITLE>1.1 An example information retrieval problem</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   An example information retrieval problem A fat book which many people own is Shakespeare's Collected Works. Suppose you wanted to determine which plays of Shakespeare contain the words Brutus AND Caesar and NOT Calpurnia. One way to do that is to start at the beginning and to read through all the text, noting for each play whether it contains Brutus and Caesar and excluding it from consideration if it contains Calpurnia. The simplest form of document retrieval is for a computer to do this sort of linear scan through documents. This process is commonly referred to as grepping through text, after the Unix command grep, which performs this process. Grepping through text can be a very effective process, especially given the speed of modern computers, and often allows useful possibilities for wildcard pattern matching through the use of . With modern computers, for simple querying of modest collections (the size of Shakespeare's Collected Works is a bit under one million words of text in total), you really need nothing more. But for many purposes, you do need more: To process large document collections quickly. The amount of online data has grown at least as quickly as the speed of computers, and we would now like to be able to search collections that total in the order of billions to trillions of words. To allow more flexible matching operations. For example, it is impractical to perform the query Romans NEAR countrymen with grep, where NEAR might be defined as ``within 5 words'' or ``within the same sentence''. To allow ranked retrieval: in many cases you want the best answer to an information need among many documents that contain certain words. The way to avoid linearly scanning the texts for each query is to index the documents in advance. Let us stick with Shakespeare's Collected Works, and use it to introduce the basics of the Boolean retrieval model. Suppose we record for each document - here a play of Shakespeare's - whether it contains each word out of all the words Shakespeare used (Shakespeare used about 32,000 different words). The result is a binary term-document incidence matrix , as in Figure 1.1 . Terms are the indexed units (further discussed in Section 2.2 ); they are usually words, and for the moment you can think of them as words, but the information retrieval literature normally speaks of terms because some of them, such as perhaps I-9 or Hong Kong are not usually thought of as words. Now, depending on whether we look at the matrix rows or columns, we can have a vector for each term, which shows the documents it appears in, or a vector for each document, showing the terms that occur in it.   To answer the query Brutus AND Caesar AND NOT Calpurnia, we take the vectors for Brutus, Caesar and Calpurnia, complement the last, and then do a bitwise AND: 110100 AND 110111 AND 101111 = 100100 1.2 The Boolean retrieval model is a model for information retrieval in which we can pose any query which is in the form of a Boolean expression of terms, that is, in which terms are combined with the operators and, or, and not. The model views each document as just a set of words.  Figure: Results from Shakespeare for the query Brutus AND Caesar AND NOT Calpurnia. Let us now consider a more realistic scenario, simultaneously using the opportunity to introduce some terminology and notation. Suppose we have documents. By documents we mean whatever units we have decided to build a retrieval system over. They might be individual memos or chapters of a book (see Section 2.1.2 (page ) for further discussion). We will refer to the group of documents over which we perform retrieval as the (document) collection . It is sometimes also referred to as a corpus (a body of texts). Suppose each document is about 1000 words long (2-3 book pages). If we assume an average of 6 bytes per word including spaces and punctuation, then this is a document collection about 6 GB in size. Typically, there might be about distinct terms in these documents. There is nothing special about the numbers we have chosen, and they might vary by an order of magnitude or more, but they give us some idea of the dimensions of the kinds of problems we need to handle. We will discuss and model these size assumptions in Section 5.1 (page ). Our goal is to develop a system to address the ad hoc retrieval task. This is the most standard IR task. In it, a system aims to provide documents from within the collection that are relevant to an arbitrary user information need, communicated to the system by means of a one-off, user-initiated query. An information need is the topic about which the user desires to know more, and is differentiated from a query , which is what the user conveys to the computer in an attempt to communicate the information need. A document is relevant if it is one that the user perceives as containing information of value with respect to their personal information need. Our example above was rather artificial in that the information need was defined in terms of particular words, whereas usually a user is interested in a topic like ``pipeline leaks'' and would like to find relevant documents regardless of whether they precisely use those words or express the concept with other words such as pipeline rupture. To assess the effectiveness of an IR system (i.e., the quality of its search results), a user will usually want to know two key statistics about the system's returned results for a query: Precision : What fraction of the returned results are relevant to the information need? Recall : What fraction of the relevant documents in the collection were returned by the system? 8 We now cannot build a term-document matrix in a naive way. A matrix has half-a-trillion 0's and 1's - too many to fit in a computer's memory. But the crucial observation is that the matrix is extremely sparse, that is, it has few non-zero entries. Because each document is 1000 words long, the matrix has no more than one billion 1's, so a minimum of 99.8% of the cells are zero. A much better representation is to record only the things that do occur, that is, the 1 positions. This idea is central to the first major concept in information retrieval, the inverted index . The name is actually redundant: an index always maps back from terms to the parts of a document where they occur. Nevertheless, inverted index, or sometimes inverted file , has become the standard term in information retrieval.The basic idea of an inverted index is shown in Figure 1.3 . We keep a dictionary of terms (sometimes also referred to as a vocabulary or lexicon ; in this book, we use dictionary for the data structure and vocabulary for the set of terms). Then for each term, we have a list that records which documents the term occurs in. Each item in the list - which records that a term appeared in a document (and, later, often, the positions in the document) - is conventionally called a posting .The list is then called a postings list (or ), and all the postings lists taken together are referred to as the postings . The dictionary in Figure 1.3 has been sorted alphabetically and each postings list is sorted by document ID. We will see why this is useful in Section 1.3 , below, but later we will also consider alternatives to doing this (Section 7.1.5 ).

  <TITLE>1.2 A first take at building an inverted index</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   A first take at building an inverted index To gain the speed benefits of indexing at retrieval time, we have to build the index in advance. The major steps in this are: Collect the documents to be indexed: ... Tokenize the text, turning each document into a list of tokens: ... Do linguistic preprocessing, producing a list of normalized tokens, which are the indexing terms: ... Index the documents that each term occurs in by creating an inverted index, consisting of a dictionary and postings. 2.2  tokens normalized tokens words  sort-based indexing   Within a document collection, we assume that each document has a unique serial number, known as the document identifier ( docID ). During index construction, we can simply assign successive integers to each new document when it is first encountered. The input to indexing is a list of normalized tokens for each document, which we can equally think of as a list of pairs of term and docID, as in Figure 1.4 . The core indexing step is sorting this list so that the terms are alphabetical, giving us the representation in the middle column of Figure 1.4 . Multiple occurrences of the same term from the same document are then merged.Instances of the same term are then grouped, and the result is split into a dictionary and postings , as shown in the right column of Figure 1.4 . Since a term generally occurs in a number of documents, this data organization already reduces the storage requirements of the index. The dictionary also records some statistics, such as the number of documents which contain each term (the document frequency , which is here also the length of each postings list). This information is not vital for a basic Boolean search engine, but it allows us to improve the efficiency of the search engine at query time, and it is a statistic later used in many ranked retrieval models. The postings are secondarily sorted by docID. This provides the basis for efficient query processing. This inverted index structure is essentially without rivals as the most efficient structure for supporting ad hoc text search. In the resulting index, we pay for storage of both the dictionary and the postings lists. The latter are much larger, but the dictionary is commonly kept in memory, while postings lists are normally kept on disk, so the size of each is important, and in Chapter 5 we will examine how each can be optimized for storage and access efficiency. What data structure should be used for a postings list? A fixed length array would be wasteful as some words occur in many documents, and others in very few. For an in-memory postings list, two good alternatives are singly linked lists or variable length arrays. Singly linked lists allow cheap insertion of documents into postings lists (following updates, such as when recrawling the web for updated documents), and naturally extend to more advanced indexing strategies such as skip lists (Section 2.3 ), which require additional pointers. Variable length arrays win in space requirements by avoiding the overhead for pointers and in time requirements because their use of contiguous memory increases speed on modern processors with memory caches. Extra pointers can in practice be encoded into the lists as offsets. If updates are relatively infrequent, variable length arrays will be more compact and faster to traverse. We can also use a hybrid scheme with a linked list of fixed length arrays for each term. When postings lists are stored on disk, they are stored (perhaps compressed) as a contiguous run of postings without explicit pointers (as in Figure 1.3 ), so as to minimize the size of the postings list and the number of disk seeks to read a postings list into memory. Exercises. Draw the inverted index that would be built for the following document collection. (See Figure 1.3 for an example.)

  <TITLE>1.3 Processing Boolean queries</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Processing Boolean queries How do we process a query using an inverted index and the basic Boolean retrieval model? Consider processing the simple conjunctive query : over the inverted index partially shown in Figure 1.3 (page ). We: Locate Brutus in the Dictionary Retrieve its postings Locate Calpurnia in the Dictionary Retrieve its postings Intersect the two postings lists, as shown in Figure 1.5 .  intersection  merging  merge algorithm  Figure: Intersecting the postings lists for Brutus and Calpurnia from Figure 1.3 .  Figure 1.6: Algorithm for the intersection of two postings lists and . There is a simple and effective method of intersecting postings lists using the merge algorithm (see Figure 1.6 ): we maintain pointers into both lists and walk through the two postings lists simultaneously, in time linear in the total number of postings entries. At each step, we compare the docID pointed to by both pointers. If they are the same, we put that docID in the results list, and advance both pointers. Otherwise we advance the pointer pointing to the smaller docID. If the lengths of the postings lists are and , the intersection takes operations. Formally, the complexity of querying is ,where is the number of documents in the collection.Our indexing methods gain us just a constant, not a difference in time complexity compared to a linear scan, but in practice the constant is huge. To use this algorithm, it is crucial that postings be sorted by a single global ordering. Using a numeric sort by docID is one simple way to achieve this. We can extend the intersection operation to process more complicated queries like: Query optimization is the process of selecting how to organize the work of answering a query so that the least total amount of work needs to be done by the system. A major element of this for Boolean queries is the order in which postings lists are accessed. What is the best order for query processing? Consider a query that is an AND of terms, for instance: For each of the terms, we need to get its postings, then AND them together. The standard heuristic is to process terms in order of increasing document frequency: if we start by intersecting the two smallest postings lists, then all intermediate results must be no bigger than the smallest postings list, and we are therefore likely to do the least amount of total work. So, for the postings lists in Figure 1.3 (page ), we execute the above query as: This is a first justification for keeping the frequency of terms in the dictionary: it allows us to make this ordering decision based on in-memory data before accessing any postings list. Consider now the optimization of more general queries, such as: As before, we will get the frequencies for all terms, and we can then (conservatively) estimate the size of each OR by the sum of the frequencies of its disjuncts. We can then process the query in increasing order of the size of each disjunctive term.  Figure 1.7: Algorithm for conjunctive queries that returns the set of documents containing each term in the input list of terms. For arbitrary Boolean queries, we have to evaluate and temporarily store the answers for intermediate expressions in a complex expression. However, in many circumstances, either because of the nature of the query language, or just because this is the most common type of query that users submit, a query is purely conjunctive. In this case, rather than viewing merging postings lists as a function with two inputs and a distinct output, it is more efficient to intersect each retrieved postings list with the current intermediate result in memory, where we initialize the intermediate result by loading the postings list of the least frequent term. This algorithm is shown in Figure 1.7 . The intersection operation is then asymmetric: the intermediate results list is in memory while the list it is being intersected with is being read from disk. Moreover the intermediate results list is always at least as short as the other list, and in many cases it is orders of magnitude shorter. The postings intersection can still be done by the algorithm in Figure 1.6 , but when the difference between the list lengths is very large, opportunities to use alternative techniques open up. The intersection can be calculated in place by destructively modifying or marking invalid items in the intermediate results list. Or the intersection can be done as a sequence of binary searches in the long postings lists for each posting in the intermediate results list. Another possibility is to store the long postings list as a hashtable, so that membership of an intermediate result item can be calculated in constant rather than linear or log time. However, such alternative techniques are difficult to combine with postings list compression of the sort discussed in Chapter 5 . Moreover, standard postings list intersection operations remain necessary when both terms of a query are very common. Exercises. For the queries below, can we still run through the intersection in time , where and are the lengths of the postings lists for Brutus and Caesar? If not, what can we achieve? Brutus and not Caesar Brutus or not Caesar Extend the postings merge algorithm to arbitrary Boolean query formulas. What is its time complexity? For instance, consider: c. (Brutus OR Caesar) AND NOT (Antony OR Cleopatra) Can we always merge in linear time? Linear in what? Can we do better than this? We can use distributive laws for and and or to rewrite queries. Show how to rewrite the query in Exercise 1.3 into disjunctive normal form using the distributive laws. Would the resulting query be more or less efficiently evaluated than the original form of this query? Is this result true in general or does it depend on the words and the contents of the document collection? Recommend a query processing order for d. (tangerine OR trees) AND (marmalade OR skies) AND (kaleidoscope OR eyes) given the following postings list sizes: Term Postings size eyes 213312 kaleidoscope 87009 marmalade 107913 skies 271658 tangerine 46653 trees 316812 If the query is: e. friends AND romans AND (NOT countrymen) how could we use the frequency of countrymen in evaluating the best query evaluation order? In particular, propose a way of handling negation in determining the order of query processing. For a conjunctive query, is processing postings lists in order of size guaranteed to be optimal? Explain why it is, or give an example where it isn't. Write out a postings merge algorithm, in the style of Figure 1.6 (page ), for an OR query. How should the Boolean query AND NOT be handled? Why is naive evaluation of this query normally very expensive? Write out a postings merge algorithm that evaluates this query efficiently.

  <TITLE>1.4 The extended Boolean model versus ranked retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The extended Boolean model versus ranked retrieval The Boolean retrieval model contrasts with ranked retrieval models such as the vector space model (Section 6.3 ), in which users largely use free text queries , that is, just typing one or more words rather than using a precise language with operators for building up query expressions, and the system decides which documents best satisfy the query. Despite decades of academic research on the advantages of ranked retrieval, systems implementing the Boolean retrieval model were the main or only search option provided by large commercial information providers for three decades until the early 1990s (approximately the date of arrival of the World Wide Web). However, these systems did not have just the basic Boolean operations (AND, OR, and NOT) which we have presented so far. A strict Boolean expression over terms with an unordered results set is too limited for many of the information needs that people have, and these systems implemented extended Boolean retrieval models by incorporating additional operators such as term proximity operators. A proximity operator is a way of specifying that two terms in a query must occur close to each other in a document, where closeness may be measured by limiting the allowed number of intervening words or by reference to a structural unit such as a sentence or paragraph.  Worked example. Commercial Boolean searching: Westlaw.westlaw Westlaw (http://www.westlaw.com/) is the largest commercial legal search service (in terms of the number of paying subscribers), with over half a million subscribers performing millions of searches a day over tens of terabytes of text data. The service was started in 1975. In 2005, Boolean search (called ``Terms and Connectors'' by Westlaw) was still the default, and used by a large percentage of users, although ranked free text querying (called ``Natural Language'' by Westlaw) was added in 1992. Here are some example Boolean queries on Westlaw:  Information need: Information on the legal theories involved in preventing the disclosure of trade secrets by employees formerly employed by a competing company. Query: "trade secret" /s disclos! /s prevent /s employe!  Information need: Requirements for disabled people to be able to access a workplace. Query: disab! /p access! /s work-site work-place (employment /3 place)    Information need: Cases about a host's responsibility for drunk guests. Query: host! /p (responsib! liab!) /p (intoxicat! drunk!) /p guest Note the long, precise queries and the use of proximity operators, both uncommon in web search. Submitted queries average about ten words in length. Unlike web search conventions, a space between words represents disjunction (the tightest binding operator),   is AND and /s, /p, and / ask for matches in the same sentence, same paragraph or within words respectively. Double quotes give a phrase search (consecutive words); see Section 2.4 (page ). The exclamation mark (!) gives a trailing wildcard query wildcard; thus liab! matches all words starting with liab. Additionally work-site matches any of worksite, work-site or work site; see Section 2.2.1 (page ). Typical expert queries are usually carefully defined and incrementally developed until they obtain what look to be good results to the user. Many users, particularly professionals, prefer Boolean query models. Boolean queries are precise: a document either matches the query or it does not. This offers the user greater control and transparency over what is retrieved. And some domains, such as legal materials, allow an effective means of document ranking within a Boolean model: Westlaw returns documents in reverse chronological order, which is in practice quite effective. In 2007, the majority of law librarians still seem to recommend terms and connectors for high recall searches, and the majority of legal users think they are getting greater control by using them. However, this does not mean that Boolean queries are more effective for professional searchers. Indeed, experimenting on a Westlaw subcollection, Turtle (1994) found that free text queries produced better results than Boolean queries prepared by Westlaw's own reference librarians for the majority of the information needs in his experiments. A general problem with Boolean search is that using AND operators tends to produce high precision but low recall searches, while using OR operators gives low precision but high recall searches, and it is difficult or impossible to find a satisfactory middle ground. End worked example. In this chapter, we have looked at the structure and construction of a basic inverted index, comprising a dictionary and postings lists. We introduced the Boolean retrieval model, and examined how to do efficient retrieval via linear time merges and simple query optimization. In dictionaryranking-ir-system we will consider in detail richer query models and the sort of augmented index structures that are needed to handle them efficiently. Here we just mention a few of the main additional things we would like to be able to do: We would like to better determine the set of terms in the dictionary and to provide retrieval that is tolerant to spelling mistakes and inconsistent choice of words. It is often useful to search for compounds or phrases that denote a concept such as ``operating system''. As the Westlaw examples show, we might also wish to do proximity queries such as Gates near Microsoft. To answer such queries, the index has to be augmented to capture the proximities of terms in documents. A Boolean model only records term presence or absence, but often we would like to accumulate evidence, giving more weight to documents that have a term several times as opposed to ones that contain it only once. To be able to do this we need term frequency information (the number of times a term occurs in a document) in postings lists. Boolean queries just retrieve a set of matching documents, but commonly we wish to have an effective method to order (or ``rank'') the returned results. This requires having a mechanism for determining a document score which encapsulates how good a match a document is for a query. With these additional ideas, we will have seen most of the basic technology that supports ad hoc searching over unstructured information. Ad hoc searching over documents has recently conquered the world, powering not only web search engines but the kind of unstructured search that lies behind the large eCommerce websites. Although the main web search engines differ by emphasizing free text querying , most of the basic issues and technologies of indexing and querying remain the same, as we will see in later chapters. Moreover, over time, web search engines have added at least partial implementations of some of the most popular operators from extended Boolean models: phrase search is especially popular and most have a very partial implementation of Boolean operators. Nevertheless, while these options are liked by expert searchers, they are little used by most people and are not the main focus in work on trying to improve web search engine performance. Exercises. Write a query using Westlaw syntax which would find any of the words professor, teacher, or lecturer in the same sentence as a form of the verb explain. Try using the Boolean search features on a couple of major web search engines. For instance, choose a word, such as burglar, and submit the queries (i) burglar, (ii) burglar AND burglar, and (iii) burglar OR burglar. Look at the estimated number of results and top hits. Do they make sense in terms of Boolean logic? Often they haven't for major search engines. Can you make sense of what is going on? What about if you try different words? For example, query for (i) knight, (ii) conquer, and then (iii) knight OR conquer. What bound should the number of results from the first two queries place on the third query? Is this bound observed?

   References and further reading The practical pursuit of computerized information retrieval began in the late 1940s (Cleverdon, 1991, Liddy, 2005). A great increase in the production of scientific literature, much in the form of less formal technical reports rather than traditional journal articles, coupled with the availability of computers, led to interest in automatic document retrieval. However, in those days, document retrieval was always based on author, title, and keywords; full-text search came much later. The article of Bush (1945) provided lasting inspiration for the new field: ``Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, `memex' will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.'' Information Retrieval Mooers, 1950 In 1958, much newspaper attention was paid to demonstrations at a conference (see Taube and Wooster, 1958) of IBM ``auto-indexing'' machines, based primarily on the work of H. P. Luhn. Commercial interest quickly gravitated towards Boolean retrieval systems, but the early years saw a heady debate over various disparate technologies for retrieval systems. For example Mooers (1961) dissented: ``It is a common fallacy, underwritten at this date by the investment of several million dollars in a variety of retrieval hardware, that the algebra of George Boole (1847) is the appropriate formalism for retrieval system design. This view is as widely and uncritically accepted as it is wrong.'' Lee and Fox, 1988 The book (Witten et al., 1999) is the standard reference for an in-depth comparison of the space and time efficiency of the inverted index versus other possible data structures; a more succinct and up-to-date presentation appears in Zobel and Moffat (2006). We further discuss several approaches in Chapter 5 . Friedl (2006) covers the practical usage of regular expressions for searching. The underlying computer science appears in (Hopcroft et al., 2000).

  <TITLE>2.1.1 Obtaining the character sequence in a document</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Obtaining the character sequence in a document Digital documents that are the input to an indexing process are typically bytes in a file or on a web server. The first step of processing is to convert this byte sequence into a linear sequence of characters. For the case of plain English text in ASCII encoding, this is trivial. But often things get much more complex. The sequence of characters may be encoded by one of various single byte or multibyte encoding schemes, such as Unicode UTF-8, or various national or vendor-specific standards. We need to determine the correct encoding. This can be regarded as a machine learning classification problem, as discussed in Chapter 13 ,but is often handled by heuristic methods, user selection, or by using provided document metadata. Once the encoding is determined, we decode the byte sequence to a character sequence. We might save the choice of encoding because it gives some evidence about what language the document is written in. The characters may have to be decoded out of some binary representation like Microsoft Word DOC files and/or a compressed format such as zip files. Again, we must determine the document format, and then an appropriate decoder has to be used. Even for plain text documents, additional decoding may need to be done. In XML documents xmlbasic, character entities, such as  amp;, need to be decoded to give the correct character, namely   for  amp;. Finally, the textual part of the document may need to be extracted out of other material that will not be processed. This might be the desired handling for XML files, if the markup is going to be ignored; we would almost certainly want to do this with postscript or PDF files. We will not deal further with these issues in this book, and will assume henceforth that our documents are a list of characters. Commercial products usually need to support a broad range of document types and encodings, since users want things to just work with their data as is. Often, they just think of documents as text inside applications and are not even aware of how it is encoded on disk. This problem is usually solved by licensing a software library that handles decoding document formats and character encodings. The idea that text is a linear sequence of characters is also called into question by some writing systems, such as Arabic, where text takes on some two dimensional and mixed order characteristics, as shown in and 2.2 . But, despite some complicated writing system conventions, there is an underlying sequence of sounds being represented and hence an essentially linear structure remains, and this is what is represented in the digital representation of Arabic, as shown in Figure 2.1 .  An example of a vocalized Modern Standard Arabic word.The writing is from right to left and letters undergo complex mutations as they are combined. The representation of short vowels (here, /i/ and /u/) and the final /n/ (nunation) departs from strict linearity by being represented as diacritics above and below letters. Nevertheless, the represented text is still clearly a linear ordering of characters representing sounds. Full vocalization, as here, normally appears only in the Koran and children's books. Day-to-day text is unvocalized (short vowels are not represented but the letter for a would still appear) or partially vocalized, with short vowels inserted in places where the writer perceives ambiguities. These choices add further complexities to indexing.  The conceptual linear order of characters is not necessarily the order that you see on the page. In languages that are written right-to-left, such as Hebrew and Arabic, it is quite common to also have left-to-right text interspersed, such as numbers and dollar amounts. With modern Unicode representation concepts, the order of characters in files matches the conceptual order, and the reversal of displayed characters is handled by the rendering system, but this may not be true for documents in older encodings.

  <TITLE>2.1.2 Choosing a document unit</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Choosing a document unit The next phase is to determine what the document unit for indexing is. Thus far we have assumed that documents are fixed units for the purposes of indexing. For example, we take each file in a folder as a document. But there are many cases in which you might want to do something different. A traditional Unix (mbox-format) email file stores a sequence of email messages (an email folder) in one file, but you might wish to regard each email message as a separate document. Many email messages now contain attached documents, and you might then want to regard the email message and each contained attachment as separate documents. If an email message has an attached zip file, you might want to decode the zip file and regard each file it contains as a separate document. Going in the opposite direction, various pieces of web software (such as latex2html) take things that you might regard as a single document (e.g., a Powerpoint file or a LATEX document) and split them into separate HTML pages for each slide or subsection, stored as separate files. In these cases, you might want to combine multiple files into a single document. More generally, for very long documents, the issue of indexing granularity arises. For a collection of books, it would usually be a bad idea to index an entire book as a document. A search for Chinese toys might bring up a book that mentions China in the first chapter and toys in the last chapter, but this does not make it relevant to the query. Instead, we may well wish to index each chapter or paragraph as a mini-document. Matches are then more likely to be relevant, and since the documents are smaller it will be much easier for the user to find the relevant passages in the document. But why stop there? We could treat individual sentences as mini-documents. It becomes clear that there is a precisionrecall tradeoff here. If the units get too small, we are likely to miss important passages because terms were distributed over several mini-documents, while if units are too large we tend to get spurious matches and the relevant information is hard for the user to find. The problems with large document units can be alleviated by use of explicit or implicit proximity search ( and 7.2.2 ), and the tradeoffs in resulting system performance that we are hinting at are discussed in Chapter 8 . The issue of index granularity, and in particular a need to simultaneously index documents at multiple levels of granularity, appears prominently in XML retrieval, and is taken up again in Chapter 10 . An IR system should be designed to offer choices of granularity. For this choice to be made well, the person who is deploying the system must have a good understanding of the document collection, the users, and their likely information needs and usage patterns. For now, we will henceforth assume that a suitable size document unit has been chosen, together with an appropriate way of dividing or aggregating files, if needed.

  <TITLE>2.2.1 Tokenization</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Tokenization Given a character sequence and a defined document unit, tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens , perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation. Here is an example of tokenization: Input: Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears; Output:   token   type  term 2.2.3  2.2.2  sleep perchance dream The major question of the tokenization phase is what are the correct tokens to use? In this example, it looks fairly trivial: you chop on whitespace and throw away punctuation characters. This is a starting point, but even for English there are a number of tricky cases. For example, what do you do about the various uses of the apostrophe for possession and contractions? Mr. O'Neill thinks that the boys' stories about Chile's capital aren't amusing. O'Neill ? aren't ?      These issues of tokenization are language-specific. It thus requires the language of the document to be known. Language identification based on classifiers that use short character subsequences as features is highly effective; most languages have distinctive signature patterns (see page 2.5 for references). For most languages and particular domains within them there are unusual specific tokens that we wish to recognize as terms, such as the programming languages C++ and C#, aircraft names like B-52, or a T.V. show name such as M*A*S*H - which is sufficiently integrated into popular culture that you find usages such as M*A*S*H-style hospitals. Computer technology has introduced new types of character sequences that a tokenizer should probably tokenize as a single token, including email addresses (jblack@mail.yahoo.com), web URLs (http://stuff.big.com/new/specials.html), numeric IP addresses (142.32.48.231), package tracking numbers (1Z9999W99845399981), and more. One possible solution is to omit from indexing tokens such as monetary amounts, numbers, and URLs, since their presence greatly expands the size of the vocabulary. However, this comes at a large cost in restricting what people can search for. For instance, people might want to search in a bug database for the line number where an error occurs. Items such as the date of an email, which have a clear semantic type, are often indexed separately as document metadata parametricsection. In English, hyphenation is used for various purposes ranging from splitting up vowels in words (co-education) to joining nouns as names (Hewlett-Packard) to a copyediting device to show word grouping (the hold-him-back-and-drag-him-away maneuver). It is easy to feel that the first example should be regarded as one token (and is indeed more commonly written as just coeducation), the last should be separated into words, and that the middle case is unclear. Handling hyphens automatically can thus be complex: it can either be done as a classification problem, or more commonly by some heuristic rules, such as allowing short hyphenated prefixes on words, but not longer hyphenated forms. Conceptually, splitting on white space can also split what should be regarded as a single token. This occurs most commonly with names (San Francisco, Los Angeles) but also with borrowed foreign phrases (au fait) and compounds that are sometimes written as a single word and sometimes space separated (such as white space vs. whitespace). Other cases with internal spaces that we might wish to regard as a single token include phone numbers ((800) 234-2333) and dates (Mar 11, 1983). Splitting tokens on spaces can cause bad retrieval results, for example, if a search for York University mainly returns documents containing New York University. The problems of hyphens and non-separating whitespace can even interact. Advertisements for air fares frequently contain items like San Francisco-Los Angeles, where simply doing whitespace splitting would give unfortunate results. In such cases, issues of tokenization interact with handling phrase queries (which we discuss in Section 2.4 (page )), particularly if we would like queries for all of lowercase, lower-case and lower case to return the same results. The last two can be handled by splitting on hyphens and using a phrase index. Getting the first case right would depend on knowing that it is sometimes written as two words and also indexing it in this way. One effective strategy in practice, which is used by some Boolean retrieval systems such as Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis (westlaw), is to encourage users to enter hyphens wherever they may be possible, and whenever there is a hyphenated form, the system will generalize the query to cover all three of the one word, hyphenated, and two word forms, so that a query for over-eager will search for over-eager OR ``over eager'' OR overeager. However, this strategy depends on user training, since if you query using either of the other two forms, you get no generalization. Each new language presents some new issues. For instance, French has a variant use of the apostrophe for a reduced definite article the before a word beginning with a vowel (e.g., l'ensemble) and has some uses of the hyphen with postposed clitic pronouns in imperatives and questions (e.g., donne-moi give me). Getting the first case correct will affect the correct indexing of a fair percentage of nouns and adjectives: you would want documents mentioning both l'ensemble and un ensemble to be indexed under ensemble. Other languages make the problem harder in new ways. German writes compound nouns without spaces (e.g., Computerlinguistik `computational linguistics'; Lebensversicherungsgesellschaftsangestellter `life insurance company employee'). Retrieval systems for German greatly benefit from the use of a compound-splitter module, which is usually implemented by seeing if a word can be subdivided into multiple words that appear in a vocabulary. This phenomenon reaches its limit case with major East Asian Languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai), where text is written without any spaces between words. An example is shown in Figure 2.3 . One approach here is to perform word segmentation as prior linguistic processing. Methods of word segmentation vary from having a large vocabulary and taking the longest vocabulary match with some heuristics for unknown words to the use of machine learning sequence models, such as hidden Markov models or conditional random fields, trained over hand-segmented words (see the references in Section 2.5 ). Since there are multiple possible segmentations of character sequences (see Figure 2.4 ), all such methods make mistakes sometimes, and so you are never guaranteed a consistent unique tokenization. The other approach is to abandon word-based indexing and to do all indexing via just short subsequences of characters (character -grams), regardless of whether particular sequences cross word boundaries or not. Three reasons why this approach is appealing are that an individual Chinese character is more like a syllable than a letter and usually has some semantic content, that most words are short (the commonest length is 2 characters), and that, given the lack of standardization of word breaking in the writing system, it is not always clear where word boundaries should be placed anyway. Even in English, some cases of where to put word boundaries are just orthographic conventions - think of notwithstanding vs. not to mention or into vs. on to - but people are educated to write the words with consistent use of spaces.  The standard unsegmented form of Chinese text using the simplified characters of mainland China.There is no whitespace between words, not even between sentences - the apparent space after the Chinese period ( ) is just a typographical illusion caused by placing the character on the left side of its square box. The first sentence is just words in Chinese characters with no spaces between them. The second and third sentences include Arabic numerals and punctuation breaking up the Chinese characters.  Ambiguities in Chinese word segmentation.The two characters can be treated as one word meaning `monk' or as a sequence of two words meaning `and' and `still'.

  <TITLE>2.2.2 Dropping common terms: stop words</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Dropping common terms: stop words  Figure 2.5: A stop list of 25 semantically non-selective words which are common in Reuters-RCV1. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words . The general strategy for determining a stop list is to sort the terms by collection frequency (the total number of times each term appears in the document collection), and then to take the most frequent terms, often hand-filtered for their semantic content relative to the domain of the documents being indexed, as a stop list , the members of which are then discarded during indexing. An example of a stop list is shown in Figure 2.5 . Using a stop list significantly reduces the number of postings that a system has to store; we will present some statistics on this in Chapter 5 (see Table 5.1 , page 5.1 ). And a lot of the time not indexing stop words does little harm: keyword searches with terms like the and by don't seem very useful. However, this is not true for phrase searches. The phrase query ``President of the United States'', which contains two stop words, is more precise than President AND ``United States''. The meaning of flights to London is likely to be lost if the word to is stopped out. A search for Vannevar Bush's article As we may think will be difficult if the first three words are stopped out, and the system searches simply for documents containing the word think. Some special query types are disproportionately affected. Some song titles and well known pieces of verse consist entirely of words that are commonly on stop lists (To be or not to be, Let It Be, I don't want to be, ...). The general trend in IR systems over time has been from standard use of quite large stop lists (200-300 terms) to very small stop lists (7-12 terms) to no stop list whatsoever. Web search engines generally do not use stop lists. Some of the design of modern IR systems has focused precisely on how we can exploit the statistics of language so as to be able to cope with common words in better ways. We will show in Section 5.3 (page ) how good compression techniques greatly reduce the cost of storing the postings for common words. idf then discusses how standard term weighting leads to very common words having little impact on document rankings. Finally, Section 7.1.5 (page ) shows how an IR system with impact-sorted indexes can terminate scanning a postings list early when weights get small, and hence common words do not cause a large additional processing cost for the average query, even though postings lists for stop words are very long. So for most modern IR systems, the additional cost of including stop words is not that big - neither in terms of index size nor in terms of query processing time.

  <TITLE>2.2.3 Normalization (equivalence classing of terms)</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Normalization (equivalence classing of terms) Having broken up our documents (and also our query) into tokens, the easy case is if tokens in the query just match tokens in the token list of the document. However, there are many cases when two character sequences are not quite the same but you would like a match to occur. For instance, if you search for USA, you might hope to also match documents containing U.S.A. Token normalization is the process of canonicalizing tokens so that matches occur despite superficial differences in the character sequences of the tokens. The most standard way to normalize is to implicitly create equivalence classes , which are normally named after one member of the set. For instance, if the tokens anti-discriminatory and antidiscriminatory are both mapped onto the term antidiscriminatory, in both the document text and queries, then searches for one term will retrieve documents that contain either. The advantage of just using mapping rules that remove characters like hyphens is that the equivalence classing to be done is implicit, rather than being fully calculated in advance: the terms that happen to become identical as the result of these rules are the equivalence classes. It is only easy to write rules of this sort that remove characters. Since the equivalence classes are implicit, it is not obvious when you might want to add characters. For instance, it would be hard to know to turn antidiscriminatory into anti-discriminatory.  Figure 2.6: An example of how asymmetric expansion of query terms can usefully model users' expectations. An alternative to creating equivalence classes is to maintain relations between unnormalized tokens. This method can be extended to hand-constructed lists of synonyms such as car and automobile, a topic we discuss further in Chapter 9 . These term relationships can be achieved in two ways. The usual way is to index unnormalized tokens and to maintain a query expansion list of multiple vocabulary entries to consider for a certain query term. A query term is then effectively a disjunction of several postings lists. The alternative is to perform the expansion during index construction. When the document contains automobile, we index it under car as well (and, usually, also vice-versa). Use of either of these methods is considerably less efficient than equivalence classing, as there are more postings to store and merge. The first method adds a query expansion dictionary and requires more processing at query time, while the second method requires more space for storing postings. Traditionally, expanding the space required for the postings lists was seen as more disadvantageous, but with modern storage costs, the increased flexibility that comes from distinct postings lists is appealing. These approaches are more flexible than equivalence classes because the expansion lists can overlap while not being identical. This means there can be an asymmetry in expansion. An example of how such an asymmetry can be exploited is shown in Figure 2.6 : if the user enters windows, we wish to allow matches with the capitalized Windows operating system, but this is not plausible if the user enters window, even though it is plausible for this query to also match lowercase windows. The best amount of equivalence classing or query expansion to do is a fairly open question. Doing some definitely seems a good idea. But doing a lot can easily have unexpected consequences of broadening queries in unintended ways. For instance, equivalence-classing U.S.A. and USA to the latter by deleting periods from tokens might at first seem very reasonable, given the prevalent pattern of optional use of periods in acronyms. However, if I put in as my query term C.A.T., I might be rather upset if it matches every appearance of the word cat in documents. Below we present some of the forms of normalization that are commonly employed and how they are implemented. In many cases they seem helpful, but they can also do harm. In fact, you can worry about many details of equivalence classing, but it often turns out that providing processing is done consistently to the query and to documents, the fine details may not have much aggregate effect on performance.

  <TITLE>2.2.4 Stemming and lemmatization</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Stemming and lemmatization For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set. The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. For instance: am, are, is be car, cars, car's, cars' car the boy's cars are different colors the boy car be differ color  Stemming  Lemmatization  lemma saw s see saw The most common algorithm for stemming English, and one that has repeatedly been shown to be empirically very effective, is Porter's algorithm (Porter, 1980). The entire algorithm is too long and intricate to present here, but we will indicate its general nature. Porter's algorithm consists of 5 phases of word reductions, applied sequentially. Within each phase there are various conventions to select rules, such as selecting the rule from each rule group that applies to the longest suffix. In the first phase, this convention is used with the following rule group: Many of the later rules use a concept of the measure of a word, which loosely checks the number of syllables to see whether a word is long enough that it is reasonable to regard the matching portion of a rule as a suffix rather than as part of the stem of a word. For example, the rule: ( )    EMENT     replacement replac cement c http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/  Figure 2.8: A comparison of three stemming algorithms on a sample text. Other stemmers exist, including the older, one-pass Lovins stemmer (Lovins, 1968), and newer entrants like the Paice/Husk stemmer (Paice, 1990); see: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/stemmers/ http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/ 2.8 Rather than using a stemmer, you can use a lemmatizer , a tool from Natural Language Processing which does full morphological analysis to accurately identify the lemma for each word. Doing full morphological analysis produces at most very modest benefits for retrieval. It is hard to say more, because either form of normalization tends not to improve English information retrieval performance in aggregate - at least not by very much. While it helps a lot for some queries, it equally hurts performance a lot for others. Stemming increases recall while harming precision. As an example of what can go wrong, note that the Porter stemmer stems all of the following words: operate operating operates operation operative operatives operational operate operational and research operating and system operative and dentistry operate system The situation is different for languages with much more morphology (such as Spanish, German, and Finnish). Results in the European CLEF evaluations have repeatedly shown quite large gains from the use of stemmers (and compound splitting for languages like German); see the references in Section 2.5 . Exercises. Are the following statements true or false? In a Boolean retrieval system, stemming never lowers precision. In a Boolean retrieval system, stemming never lowers recall. Stemming increases the size of the vocabulary. Stemming should be invoked at indexing time but not while processing a query.

  <TITLE>2.3 Faster postings list intersection via skip pointers</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Faster postings list intersection via skip pointers In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss extensions to postings list data structures and ways to increase the efficiency of using postings lists. Recall the basic postings list intersection operation from Section 1.3 (page ): we walk through the two postings lists simultaneously, in time linear in the total number of postings entries. If the list lengths are and , the intersection takes operations. Can we do better than this? That is, empirically, can we usually process postings list intersection in sublinear time? We can, if the index isn't changing too fast. One way to do this is to use a skip list by augmenting postings lists with skip pointers (at indexing time), as shown in Figure 2.9 . Skip pointers are effectively shortcuts that allow us to avoid processing parts of the postings list that will not figure in the search results. The two questions are then where to place skip pointers and how to do efficient merging using skip pointers.  Postings lists with skip pointers.The postings intersection can use a skip pointer when the end point is still less than the item on the other list.  Figure 2.10: Postings lists intersection with skip pointers. Consider first efficient merging, with Figure 2.9 as an example. Suppose we've stepped through the lists in the figure until we have matched on each list and moved it to the results list. We advance both pointers, giving us on the upper list and on the lower list. The smallest item is then the element on the top list. Rather than simply advancing the upper pointer, we first check the skip list pointer and note that 28 is also less than 41. Hence we can follow the skip list pointer, and then we advance the upper pointer to . We thus avoid stepping to and on the upper list. A number of variant versions of postings list intersection with skip pointers is possible depending on when exactly you check the skip pointer. One version is shown in Figure 2.10 . Skip pointers will only be available for the original postings lists. For an intermediate result in a complex query, the call will always return false. Finally, note that the presence of skip pointers only helps for AND queries, not for OR queries. Where do we place skips? There is a tradeoff. More skips means shorter skip spans, and that we are more likely to skip. But it also means lots of comparisons to skip pointers, and lots of space storing skip pointers. Fewer skips means few pointer comparisons, but then long skip spans which means that there will be fewer opportunities to skip. A simple heuristic for placing skips, which has been found to work well in practice, is that for a postings list of length , use evenly-spaced skip pointers. This heuristic can be improved upon; it ignores any details of the distribution of query terms. Building effective skip pointers is easy if an index is relatively static; it is harder if a postings list keeps changing because of updates. A malicious deletion strategy can render skip lists ineffective. Choosing the optimal encoding for an inverted index is an ever-changing game for the system builder, because it is strongly dependent on underlying computer technologies and their relative speeds and sizes. Traditionally, CPUs were slow, and so highly compressed techniques were not optimal. Now CPUs are fast and disk is slow, so reducing disk postings list size dominates. However, if you're running a search engine with everything in memory then the equation changes again. We discuss the impact of hardware parameters on index construction time in Section 4.1 (page ) and the impact of index size on system speed in Chapter 5 . Exercises. Why are skip pointers not useful for queries of the form OR ? We have a two-word query. For one term the postings list consists of the following 16 entries: [4,6,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,32,47,81,120,122,157,180] and for the other it is the one entry postings list: [47]. Work out how many comparisons would be done to intersect the two postings lists with the following two strategies. Briefly justify your answers: Using standard postings lists Using postings lists stored with skip pointers, with a skip length of , as suggested in Section 2.3 . Consider a postings intersection between this postings list, with skip pointers: xunit=0.6cm,arcangle=30 and the following intermediate result postings list (which hence has no skip pointers): 3    5    89    95    97    99    100    101 Trace through the postings intersection algorithm in Figure 2.10 (page ). How often is a skip pointer followed (i.e., is advanced to )? How many postings comparisons will be made by this algorithm while intersecting the two lists? How many postings comparisons would be made if the postings lists are intersected without the use of skip pointers?

  <TITLE>2.4 Positional postings and phrase queries</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Positional postings and phrase queries Many complex or technical concepts and many organization and product names are multiword compounds or phrases. We would like to be able to pose a query such as Stanford University by treating it as a phrase so that a sentence in a document like The inventor Stanford Ovshinsky never went to university. is not a match. Most recent search engines support a double quotes syntax (``stanford university'') for phrase queries , which has proven to be very easily understood and successfully used by users. As many as 10% of web queries are phrase queries, and many more are implicit phrase queries (such as person names), entered without use of double quotes. To be able to support such queries, it is no longer sufficient for postings lists to be simply lists of documents that contain individual terms. In this section we consider two approaches to supporting phrase queries and their combination. A search engine should not only support phrase queries, but implement them efficiently. A related but distinct concept is term proximity weighting, where a document is preferred to the extent that the query terms appear close to each other in the text. This technique is covered in Section 7.2.2 (page ) in the context of ranked retrieval.   Subsections Biword indexes Positional indexes Positional index size. Combination schemes

  <TITLE>2.4.1 Biword indexes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Biword indexes One approach to handling phrases is to consider every pair of consecutive terms in a document as a phrase. For example, the text Friends, Romans, Countrymen would generate the biwords : friends romans romans countrymen ``stanford university'' AND ``university palo'' AND ``palo alto'' Among possible queries, nouns and noun phrases have a special status in describing the concepts people are interested in searching for. But related nouns can often be divided from each other by various function words, in phrases such as the abolition of slavery or renegotiation of the constitution. These needs can be incorporated into the biword indexing model in the following way. First, we tokenize the text and perform part-of-speech-tagging.We can then group terms into nouns, including proper nouns, (N) and function words, including articles and prepositions, (X), among other classes. Now deem any string of terms of the form NX*N to be an extended biword. Each such extended biword is made a term in the vocabulary. For example: renegotiation of the constitution N X X N This algorithm does not always work in an intuitively optimal manner when parsing longer queries into Boolean queries. Using the above algorithm, the query cost overruns on a power plant ``cost overruns'' AND ``overruns power'' AND ``power plant'' The concept of a biword index can be extended to longer sequences of words, and if the index includes variable length word sequences, it is generally referred to as a phrase index . Indeed, searches for a single term are not naturally handled in a biword index (you would need to scan the dictionary for all biwords containing the term), and so we also need to have an index of single-word terms. While there is always a chance of false positive matches, the chance of a false positive match on indexed phrases of length 3 or more becomes very small indeed. But on the other hand, storing longer phrases has the potential to greatly expand the vocabulary size. Maintaining exhaustive phrase indexes for phrases of length greater than two is a daunting prospect, and even use of an exhaustive biword dictionary greatly expands the size of the vocabulary. However, towards the end of this section we discuss the utility of the strategy of using a partial phrase index in a compound indexing scheme.

  <TITLE>2.4.2 Positional indexes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Positional indexes For the reasons given, a biword index is not the standard solution. Rather, a positional index is most commonly employed. Here, for each term in the vocabulary, we store postings of the form docID: position1, position2, ..., as shown in Figure 2.11 , where each position is a token index in the document. Each posting will also usually record the term frequency, for reasons discussed in Chapter 6 .   To process a phrase query, you still need to access the inverted index entries for each distinct term. As before, you would start with the least frequent term and then work to further restrict the list of possible candidates. In the merge operation, the same general technique is used as before, but rather than simply checking that both terms are in a document, you also need to check that their positions of appearance in the document are compatible with the phrase query being evaluated. This requires working out offsets between the words. Worked example. Satisfying phrase queries.phrasequery Suppose the postings lists for to and be are as in Figure 2.11 , and the query is ``to be or not to be''. The postings lists to access are: to, be, or, not. We will examine intersecting the postings lists for to and be. We first look for documents that contain both terms. Then, we look for places in the lists where there is an occurrence of be with a token index one higher than a position of to, and then we look for another occurrence of each word with token index 4 higher than the first occurrence. In the above lists, the pattern of occurrences that is a possible match is: to: ...; 4: ...,429,433 ; ... be: ...; 4: ...,430,434 ; ... End worked example.   The same general method is applied for within word proximity searches, of the sort we saw in westlaw: employment /3 place   2.12  2.4.3   Subsections Positional index size.

  <TITLE>2.4.3 Combination schemes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Combination schemes The strategies of biword indexes and positional indexes can be fruitfully combined. If users commonly query on particular phrases, such as Michael Jackson, it is quite inefficient to keep merging positional postings lists. A combination strategy uses a phrase index, or just a biword index , for certain queries and uses a positional index for other phrase queries. Good queries to include in the phrase index are ones known to be common based on recent querying behavior. But this is not the only criterion: the most expensive phrase queries to evaluate are ones where the individual words are common but the desired phrase is comparatively rare. Adding Britney Spears as a phrase index entry may only give a speedup factor to that query of about 3, since most documents that mention either word are valid results, whereas adding The Who as a phrase index entry may speed up that query by a factor of 1000. Hence, having the latter is more desirable, even if it is a relatively less common query. Williams et al. (2004) evaluate an even more sophisticated scheme which employs indexes of both these sorts and additionally a partial next word index as a halfway house between the first two strategies. For each term, a next word index records terms that follow it in a document. They conclude that such a strategy allows a typical mixture of web phrase queries to be completed in one quarter of the time taken by use of a positional index alone, while taking up 26% more space than use of a positional index alone. Exercises. Assume a biword index. Give an example of a document which will be returned for a query of New York University but is actually a false positive which should not be returned. Shown below is a portion of a positional index in the format: term: doc1: position1, position2, ...; doc2: position1, position2, ...; etc. angels: 2: 36,174,252,651 ; 4: 12,22,102,432 ; 7: 17 ; fools: 2: 1,17,74,222 ; 4: 8,78,108,458 ; 7: 3,13,23,193 ; fear: 2: 87,704,722,901 ; 4: 13,43,113,433 ; 7: 18,328,528 ; in: 2: 3,37,76,444,851 ; 4: 10,20,110,470,500 ; 7: 5,15,25,195 ; rush: 2: 2,66,194,321,702 ; 4: 9,69,149,429,569 ; 7: 4,14,404 ; to: 2: 47,86,234,999 ; 4: 14,24,774,944 ; 7: 199,319,599,709 ; tread: 2: 57,94,333 ; 4: 15,35,155 ; 7: 20,320 ; where: 2: 67,124,393,1001 ; 4: 11,41,101,421,431 ; 7: 16,36,736 ; Which document(s) if any match each of the following queries, where each expression within quotes is a phrase query? ``fools rush in'' ``fools rush in'' AND ``angels fear to tread'' Consider the following fragment of a positional index with the format: word: document: position, position, ; document: position, ... Gates: 1: 3 ; 2: 6 ; 3: 2,17 ; 4: 1 ; IBM: 4: 3 ; 7: 14 ; Microsoft: 1: 1 ; 2: 1,21 ; 3: 3 ; 5: 16,22,51 ; The / operator, word1 / word2 finds occurrences of word1 within words of word2 (on either side), where is a positive integer argument. Thus demands that word1 be adjacent to word2. Describe the set of documents that satisfy the query Gates /2 Microsoft. Describe each set of values for for which the query Gates / Microsoft returns a different set of documents as the answer. Consider the general procedure for merging two positional postings lists for a given document, to determine the document positions where a document satisfies a / clause (in general there can be multiple positions at which each term occurs in a single document). We begin with a pointer to the position of occurrence of each term and move each pointer along the list of occurrences in the document, checking as we do so whether we have a hit for /. Each move of either pointer counts as a step. Let denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document. What is the big-O complexity of the merge procedure, if we wish to have postings including positions in the result? Consider the adaptation of the basic algorithm for intersection of two postings lists postings-merge-algorithm to the one in Figure 2.12 (page ), which handles proximity queries. A naive algorithm for this operation could be , where is the sum of the lengths of the postings lists (i.e., the sum of document frequencies) and is the maximum length of a document (in tokens). Go through this algorithm carefully and explain how it works. What is the complexity of this algorithm? Justify your answer carefully. For certain queries and data distributions, would another algorithm be more efficient? What complexity does it have? Suppose we wish to use a postings intersection procedure to determine simply the list of documents that satisfy a / clause, rather than returning the list of positions, as in Figure 2.12 (page ). For simplicity, assume . Let denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document collection (i.e., the sum of their collection frequencies). Which of the following is true? Justify your answer. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in and independent of , and we can ensure that each pointer moves only to the right. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in and independent of , but a pointer may be forced to move non-monotonically (i.e., to sometimes back up) The merge can require steps in some cases. How could an IR system combine use of a positional index and use of stop words? What is the potential problem, and how could it be handled?

   References and further reading Exhaustive discussion of the character-level processing of can be found in Lunde (1998). Character bigram indexes are perhaps the most standard approach to indexing Chinese, although some systems use word segmentation. Due to differences in the language and writing system, word segmentation is most usual for Japanese (Luk and Kwok, 2002, Kishida et al., 2005). The structure of a character -gram index over unsegmented text differs from that in Section 3.2.2 (page ): there the -gram dictionary points to postings lists of entries in the regular dictionary, whereas here it points directly to document postings lists. For further discussion of Chinese word segmentation, see Tseng et al. (2005), Sproat and Emerson (2003), Sproat et al. (1996), and Gao et al. (2005). Lita et al. (2003) present a method for truecasing . Natural language processing work on computational morphology is presented in (Sproat, 1992, Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). Language identification was perhaps first explored in cryptography; for example, Konheim (1981) presents a character-level -gram language identification algorithm. While other methods such as looking for particular distinctive function words and letter combinations have been used, with the advent of widespread digital text, many people have explored the character -gram technique, and found it to be highly successful (Beesley, 1998, Dunning, 1994, Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994). Written language identification is regarded as a fairly easy problem, while spoken language identification remains more difficult; see Hughes et al. (2006) for a recent survey. Experiments on and discussion of the positive and negative impact of stemming in English can be found in the following works: Salton (1989), Krovetz (1995), Hull (1996), Harman (1991). Hollink et al. (2004) provide detailed results for the effectiveness of language-specific methods on 8 European languages. In terms of percent change in mean average precision (see page 8.4 ) over a baseline system, diacritic removal gains up to 23% (being especially helpful for Finnish, French, and Swedish). Stemming helped markedly for Finnish (30% improvement) and Spanish (10% improvement), but for most languages, including English, the gain from stemming was in the range 0-5%, and results from a lemmatizer were poorer still. Compound splitting gained 25% for Swedish and 15% for German, but only 4% for Dutch. Rather than language-particular methods, indexing character -grams (as we suggested for Chinese) could often give as good or better results: using within-word character 4-grams rather than words gave gains of 37% in Finnish, 27% in Swedish, and 20% in German, while even being slightly positive for other languages, such as Dutch, Spanish, and English. Tomlinson (2003) presents broadly similar results. Bar-Ilan and Gutman (2005) suggest that, at the time of their study (2003), the major commercial web search engines suffered from lacking decent language-particular processing; for example, a query on www.google.fr for l'électricité did not separate off the article l' but only matched pages with precisely this string of article+noun. The classic presentation of for IR can be found in Moffat and Zobel (1996). Extended techniques are discussed in Boldi and Vigna (2005). The main paper in the algorithms literature is Pugh (1990), which uses multilevel skip pointers to give expected list access (the same expected efficiency as using a tree data structure) with less implementational complexity. In practice, the effectiveness of using skip pointers depends on various system parameters. Moffat and Zobel (1996) report conjunctive queries running about five times faster with the use of skip pointers, but Bahle et al. (2002, p. 217) report that, with modern CPUs, using skip lists instead slows down search because it expands the size of the postings list (i.e., disk I/O dominates performance). In contrast, Strohman and Croft (2007) again show good performance gains from skipping, in a system architecture designed to optimize for the large memory spaces and multiple cores of recent CPUs. Johnson et al. (2006) report that 11.7% of all queries in two 2002 web query logs contained phrase queries , though Kammenhuber et al. (2006) report only 3% phrase queries for a different data set. Silverstein et al. (1999) note that many queries without explicit phrase operators are actually implicit phrase searches.

  <TITLE>Chapter 3 Dictionaries and tolerant retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Dictionaries and tolerant retrieval In Chapters 1 2 we developed the ideas underlying inverted indexes for handling Boolean and proximity queries. Here, we develop techniques that are robust to typographical errors in the query, as well as alternative spellings. In Section 3.1 we develop data structures that help the search for terms in the vocabulary in an inverted index. In Section 3.2 we study the idea of a wildcard query : a query such as *a*e*i*o*u*, which seeks documents containing any term that includes all the five vowels in sequence. The * symbol indicates any (possibly empty) string of characters. Users pose such queries to a search engine when they are uncertain about how to spell a query term, or seek documents containing variants of a query term; for instance, the query automat* would seek documents containing any of the terms automatic, automation and automated. We then turn to other forms of imprecisely posed queries, focusing on spelling errors in Section 3.3 . Users make spelling errors either by accident, or because the term they are searching for (e.g., Herman) has no unambiguous spelling in the collection. We detail a number of techniques for correcting spelling errors in queries, one term at a time as well as for an entire string of query terms. Finally, in Section 3.4 we study a method for seeking vocabulary terms that are phonetically close to the query term(s). This can be especially useful in cases like the Herman example, where the user may not know how a proper name is spelled in documents in the collection. Because we will develop many variants of inverted indexes in this chapter, we will use sometimes the phrase standard inverted index to mean the inverted index developed in Chapters 1 2 , in which each vocabulary term has a postings list with the documents in the collection.

  <TITLE>3.1 Search structures for dictionaries</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Search structures for dictionaries Given an inverted index and a query, our first task is to determine whether each query term exists in the vocabulary and if so, identify the pointer to the corresponding postings. This vocabulary lookup operation uses a classical data structure called the dictionary and has two broad classes of solutions: hashing, and search trees. In the literature of data structures, the entries in the vocabulary (in our case, terms) are often referred to as keys. The choice of solution (hashing, or search trees) is governed by a number of questions: (1) How many keys are we likely to have? (2) Is the number likely to remain static, or change a lot - and in the case of changes, are we likely to only have new keys inserted, or to also have some keys in the dictionary be deleted? (3) What are the relative frequencies with which various keys will be accessed? Hashing has been used for dictionary lookup in some search engines. Each vocabulary term (key) is hashed into an integer over a large enough space that hash collisions are unlikely; collisions if any are resolved by auxiliary structures that can demand care to maintain. At query time, we hash each query term separately and following a pointer to the corresponding postings, taking into account any logic for resolving hash collisions. There is no easy way to find minor variants of a query term (such as the accented and non-accented versions of a word like resume), since these could be hashed to very different integers. In particular, we cannot seek (for instance) all terms beginning with the prefix automat, an operation that we will require below in Section 3.2 . Finally, in a setting (such as the Web) where the size of the vocabulary keeps growing, a hash function designed for current needs may not suffice in a few years' time.  A binary search tree.In this example the branch at the root partitions vocabulary terms into two subtrees, those whose first letter is between a and m, and the rest. Search trees overcome many of these issues - for instance, they permit us to enumerate all vocabulary terms beginning with automat. The best-known search tree is the binary tree , in which each internal node has two children. The search for a term begins at the root of the tree. Each internal node (including the root) represents a binary test, based on whose outcome the search proceeds to one of the two sub-trees below that node. Figure 3.1 gives an example of a binary search tree used for a dictionary. Efficient search (with a number of comparisons that is ) hinges on the tree being balanced: the numbers of terms under the two sub-trees of any node are either equal or differ by one. The principal issue here is that of rebalancing: as terms are inserted into or deleted from the binary search tree, it needs to be rebalanced so that the balance property is maintained. To mitigate rebalancing, one approach is to allow the number of sub-trees under an internal node to vary in a fixed interval. A search tree commonly used for a dictionary is the B-tree - a search tree in which every internal node has a number of children in the interval , where and are appropriate positive integers; Figure 3.2 shows an example with and . Each branch under an internal node again represents a test for a range of character sequences, as in the binary tree example of Figure 3.1 . A B-tree may be viewed as ``collapsing'' multiple levels of the binary tree into one; this is especially advantageous when some of the dictionary is disk-resident, in which case this collapsing serves the function of pre-fetching imminent binary tests. In such cases, the integers and are determined by the sizes of disk blocks. Section 3.5 contains pointers to further background on search trees and B-trees.  A B-tree.In this example every internal node has between 2 and 4 children. It should be noted that unlike hashing, search trees demand that the characters used in the document collection have a prescribed ordering; for instance, the 26 letters of the English alphabet are always listed in the specific order A through Z. Some Asian languages such as Chinese do not always have a unique ordering, although by now all languages (including Chinese and Japanese) have adopted a standard ordering system for their character sets.

  <TITLE>3.2 Wildcard queries</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Wildcard queries Wildcard queries are used in any of the following situations: (1) the user is uncertain of the spelling of a query term (e.g., Sydney vs. Sidney, which leads to the wildcard query S*dney); (2) the user is aware of multiple variants of spelling a term and (consciously) seeks documents containing any of the variants (e.g., color vs. colour); (3) the user seeks documents containing variants of a term that would be caught by stemming, but is unsure whether the search engine performs stemming (e.g., judicial vs. judiciary, leading to the wildcard query judicia*); (4) the user is uncertain of the correct rendition of a foreign word or phrase (e.g., the query Universit* Stuttgart). A query such as mon* is known as a trailing wildcard query , because the * symbol occurs only once, at the end of the search string. A search tree on the dictionary is a convenient way of handling trailing wildcard queries: we walk down the tree following the symbols m, o and n in turn, at which point we can enumerate the set of terms in the dictionary with the prefix mon. Finally, we use lookups on the standard inverted index to retrieve all documents containing any term in . But what about wildcard queries in which the * symbol is not constrained to be at the end of the search string? Before handling this general case, we mention a slight generalization of trailing wildcard queries. First, consider leading wildcard queries, or queries of the form *mon. Consider a reverse B-tree on the dictionary - one in which each root-to-leaf path of the B-tree corresponds to a term in the dictionary written backwards: thus, the term lemon would, in the B-tree, be represented by the path root-n-o-m-e-l. A walk down the reverse B-tree then enumerates all terms in the vocabulary with a given prefix. In fact, using a regular B-tree together with a reverse B-tree, we can handle an even more general case: wildcard queries in which there is a single * symbol, such as se*mon. To do this, we use the regular B-tree to enumerate the set of dictionary terms beginning with the prefix se, then the reverse B-tree to enumerate the set of terms ending with the suffix mon. Next, we take the intersection of these two sets, to arrive at the set of terms that begin with the prefix se and end with the suffix mon. Finally, we use the standard inverted index to retrieve all documents containing any terms in this intersection. We can thus handle wildcard queries that contain a single * symbol using two B-trees, the normal B-tree and a reverse B-tree.

  <TITLE>3.2.2 k-gram indexes for wildcard queries</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   k-gram indexes for wildcard queries Whereas the permuterm index is simple, it can lead to a considerable blowup from the number of rotations per term; for a dictionary of English terms, this can represent an almost ten-fold space increase. We now present a second technique, known as the -gram index, for processing wildcard queries. We will also use -gram indexes in Section 3.3.4 . A -gram is a sequence of characters. Thus cas, ast and stl are all 3-grams occurring in the term castle. We use a special character $ to denote the beginning or end of a term, so the full set of 3-grams generated for castle is: $ca, cas, ast, stl, tle, le$. In a -gram index , the dictionary contains all -grams that occur in any term in the vocabulary. Each postings list points from a -gram to all vocabulary terms containing that -gram. For instance, the 3-gram etr would point to vocabulary terms such as metric and retrieval. An example is given in Figure 3.4 .   How does such an index help us with wildcard queries? Consider the wildcard query re*ve. We are seeking documents containing any term that begins with re and ends with ve. Accordingly, we run the Boolean query $re AND ve$. This is looked up in the 3-gram index and yields a list of matching terms such as relive, remove and retrieve. Each of these matching terms is then looked up in the standard inverted index to yield documents matching the query. There is however a difficulty with the use of -gram indexes, that demands one further step of processing. Consider using the 3-gram index described above for the query red*. Following the process described above, we first issue the Boolean query $re AND red to the 3-gram index. This leads to a match on terms such as retired, which contain the conjunction of the two 3-grams $re and red, yet do not match the original wildcard query red*. To cope with this, we introduce a post-filtering step, in which the terms enumerated by the Boolean query on the 3-gram index are checked individually against the original query red*. This is a simple string-matching operation and weeds out terms such as retired that do not match the original query. Terms that survive are then searched in the standard inverted index as usual. We have seen that a wildcard query can result in multiple terms being enumerated, each of which becomes a single-term query on the standard inverted index. Search engines do allow the combination of wildcard queries using Boolean operators, for example, re*d AND fe*ri. What is the appropriate semantics for such a query? Since each wildcard query turns into a disjunction of single-term queries, the appropriate interpretation of this example is that we have a conjunction of disjunctions: we seek all documents that contain any term matching re*d and any term matching fe*ri. Even without Boolean combinations of wildcard queries, the processing of a wildcard query can be quite expensive, because of the added lookup in the special index, filtering and finally the standard inverted index. A search engine may support such rich functionality, but most commonly, the capability is hidden behind an interface (say an ``Advanced Query'' interface) that most users never use. Exposing such functionality in the search interface often encourages users to invoke it even when they do not require it (say, by typing a prefix of their query followed by a *), increasing the processing load on the search engine. Exercises. In the permuterm index, each permuterm vocabulary term points to the original vocabulary term(s) from which it was derived. How many original vocabulary terms can there be in the postings list of a permuterm vocabulary term? Write down the entries in the permuterm index dictionary that are generated by the term mama. If you wanted to search for s*ng in a permuterm wildcard index, what key(s) would one do the lookup on? Refer to Figure 3.4 ; it is pointed out in the caption that the vocabulary terms in the postings are lexicographically ordered. Why is this ordering useful? Consider again the query fi*mo*er from Section 3.2.1 . What Boolean query on a bigram index would be generated for this query? Can you think of a term that matches the permuterm query in Section 3.2.1 , but does not satisfy this Boolean query? Give an example of a sentence that falsely matches the wildcard query mon*h if the search were to simply use a conjunction of bigrams.

   Spelling correction We next look at the problem of correcting spelling errors in queries. For instance, we may wish to retrieve documents containing the term carrot when the user types the query carot. Google reports (http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html) that the following are all treated as misspellings of the query britney spears: britian spears, britney's spears, brandy spears and prittany spears. We look at two steps to solving this problem: the first based on edit distance and the second based on -gram overlap. Before getting into the algorithmic details of these methods, we first review how search engines provide spell-correction as part of a user experience.

  <TITLE>3.3.1 Implementing spelling correction</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Implementing spelling correction Of various alternative correct spellings for a mis-spelled query, choose the ``nearest'' one. This demands that we have a notion of nearness or proximity between a pair of queries. We will develop these proximity measures in Section 3.3.3 . When two correctly spelled queries are tied (or nearly tied), select the one that is more common. For instance, grunt and grant both seem equally plausible as corrections for grnt. Then, the algorithm should choose the more common of grunt and grant as the correction. The simplest notion of more common is to consider the number of occurrences of the term in the collection; thus if grunt occurs more often than grant, it would be the chosen correction. A different notion of more common is employed in many search engines, especially on the web. The idea is to use the correction that is most common among queries typed in by other users. The idea here is that if grunt is typed as a query more often than grant, then it is more likely that the user who typed grnt intended to type the query grunt. Beginning in Section 3.3.3 we describe notions of proximity between queries, as well as their efficient computation. Spelling correction algorithms build on these computations of proximity; their functionality is then exposed to users in one of several ways: On the query carot always retrieve documents containing carot as well as any ``spell-corrected'' version of carot, including carrot and tarot. As in (1) above, but only when the query term carot is not in the dictionary. As in (1) above, but only when the original query returned fewer than a preset number of documents (say fewer than five documents). When the original query returns fewer than a preset number of documents, the search interface presents a spelling suggestion to the end user: this suggestion consists of the spell-corrected query term(s). Thus, the search engine might respond to the user: ``Did you mean carrot?''

  <TEXT>
   Edit distance    edit distance edit operations    Levenshtein distance 3.4 It is well-known how to compute the (weighted) edit distance between two strings in time , where denotes the length of a string . The idea is to use the dynamic programming algorithm in Figure 3.5 , where the characters in and are given in array form. The algorithm fills the (integer) entries in a matrix whose two dimensions equal the lengths of the two strings whose edit distances is being computed; the entry of the matrix will hold (after the algorithm is executed) the edit distance between the strings consisting of the first characters of and the first characters of . The central dynamic programming step is depicted in Lines 8-10 of Figure 3.5 , where the three quantities whose minimum is taken correspond to substituting a character in , inserting a character in and inserting a character in .  Figure 3.5: Dynamic programming algorithm for computing the edit distance between strings and . Figure 3.6 shows an example Levenshtein distance computation of Figure 3.5 . The typical cell has four entries formatted as a cell. The lower right entry in each cell is the of the other three, corresponding to the main dynamic programming step in Figure 3.5 . The other three entries are the three entries or 1 depending on whether and . The cells with numbers in italics depict the path by which we determine the Levenshtein distance.   The spelling correction problem however demands more than computing edit distance: given a set of strings (corresponding to terms in the vocabulary) and a query string , we seek the string(s) in of least edit distance from . We may view this as a decoding problem, in which the codewords (the strings in ) are prescribed in advance. The obvious way of doing this is to compute the edit distance from to each string in , before selecting the string(s) of minimum edit distance. This exhaustive search is inordinately expensive. Accordingly, a number of heuristics are used in practice to efficiently retrieve vocabulary terms likely to have low edit distance to the query term(s). The simplest such heuristic is to restrict the search to dictionary terms beginning with the same letter as the query string; the hope would be that spelling errors do not occur in the first character of the query. A more sophisticated variant of this heuristic is to use a version of the permuterm index, in which we omit the end-of-word symbol $. Consider the set of all rotations of the query string . For each rotation from this set, we traverse the B-tree into the permuterm index, thereby retrieving all dictionary terms that have a rotation beginning with . For instance, if is mase and we consider the rotation , we would retrieve dictionary terms such as semantic and semaphore that do not have a small edit distance to . Unfortunately, we would miss more pertinent dictionary terms such as mare and mane. To address this, we refine this rotation scheme: for each rotation, we omit a suffix of characters before performing the B-tree traversal. This ensures that each term in the set of terms retrieved from the dictionary includes a ``long'' substring in common with . The value of could depend on the length of . Alternatively, we may set it to a fixed constant such as .

  <TITLE>3.3.4 k-gram indexes for spelling correction</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   k-gram indexes for spelling correction To further limit the set of vocabulary terms for which we compute edit distances to the query term, we now show how to invoke the -gram index of Section 3.2.2 (page ) to assist with retrieving vocabulary terms with low edit distance to the query . Once we retrieve such terms, we can then find the ones of least edit distance from . In fact, we will use the -gram index to retrieve vocabulary terms that have many -grams in common with the query. We will argue that for reasonable definitions of ``many -grams in common,'' the retrieval process is essentially that of a single scan through the postings for the -grams in the query string .  Figure: Matching at least two of the three 2-grams in the query bord. The 2-gram (or bigram) index in Figure 3.7 shows (a portion of) the postings for the three bigrams in the query bord. Suppose we wanted to retrieve vocabulary terms that contained at least two of these three bigrams. A single scan of the postings (much as in Chapter 1 ) would let us enumerate all such terms; in the example of Figure 3.7 we would enumerate aboard, boardroom and border. This straightforward application of the linear scan intersection of postings immediately reveals the shortcoming of simply requiring matched vocabulary terms to contain a fixed number of -grams from the query : terms like boardroom, an implausible ``correction'' of bord, get enumerated. Consequently, we require more nuanced measures of the overlap in -grams between a vocabulary term and . The linear scan intersection can be adapted when the measure of overlap is the Jaccard coefficient for measuring the overlap between two sets and , defined to be . The two sets we consider are the set of -grams in the query , and the set of -grams in a vocabulary term. As the scan proceeds, we proceed from one vocabulary term to the next, computing on the fly the Jaccard coefficient between and . If the coefficient exceeds a preset threshold, we add to the output; if not, we move on to the next term in the postings. To compute the Jaccard coefficient, we need the set of -grams in and . Since we are scanning the postings for all -grams in , we immediately have these -grams on hand. What about the -grams of ? In principle, we could enumerate these on the fly from ; in practice this is not only slow but potentially infeasible since, in all likelihood, the postings entries themselves do not contain the complete string but rather some encoding of . The crucial observation is that to compute the Jaccard coefficient, we only need the length of the string . To see this, recall the example of Figure 3.7 and consider the point when the postings scan for query bord reaches term boardroom. We know that two bigrams match. If the postings stored the (pre-computed) number of bigrams in boardroom (namely, 8), we have all the information we require to compute the Jaccard coefficient to be ; the numerator is obtained from the number of postings hits (2, from bo and rd) while the denominator is the sum of the number of bigrams in bord and boardroom, less the number of postings hits. We could replace the Jaccard coefficient by other measures that allow efficient on the fly computation during postings scans. How do we use these for spelling correction? One method that has some empirical support is to first use the -gram index to enumerate a set of candidate vocabulary terms that are potential corrections of . We then compute the edit distance from to each term in this set, selecting terms from the set with small edit distance to .

  <TITLE>3.3.5 Context sensitive spelling correction</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Context sensitive spelling correction 3.3.4 This enumeration can be expensive if we find many corrections of the individual terms, since we could encounter a large number of combinations of alternatives. Several heuristics are used to trim this space. In the example above, as we expand the alternatives for flew and form, we retain only the most frequent combinations in the collection or in the query logs, which contain previous queries by users. For instance, we would retain flew from as an alternative to try and extend to a three-term corrected query, but perhaps not fled fore or flea form. In this example, the biword fled fore is likely to be rare compared to the biword flew from. Then, we only attempt to extend the list of top biwords (such as flew from), to corrections of Heathrow. As an alternative to using the biword statistics in the collection, we may use the logs of queries issued by users; these could of course include queries with spelling errors. Exercises. If denotes the length of string , show that the edit distance between and is never more than Compute the edit distance between paris and alice. Write down the array of distances between all prefixes as computed by the algorithm in Figure 3.5 . Write pseudocode showing the details of computing on the fly the Jaccard coefficient while scanning the postings of the -gram index, as mentioned on page 3.3.4 . Compute the Jaccard coefficients between the query bord and each of the terms in Figure 3.7 that contain the bigram or. Consider the four-term query catched in the rye and suppose that each of the query terms has five alternative terms suggested by isolated-term correction. How many possible corrected phrases must we consider if we do not trim the space of corrected phrases, but instead try all six variants for each of the terms? For each of the prefixes of the query -- catched, catched in and catched in the -- we have a number of substitute prefixes arising from each term and its alternatives. Suppose that we were to retain only the top 10 of these substitute prefixes, as measured by its number of occurrences in the collection. We eliminate the rest from consideration for extension to longer prefixes: thus, if batched in is not one of the 10 most common 2-term queries in the collection, we do not consider any extension of batched in as possibly leading to a correction of catched in the rye. How many of the possible substitute prefixes are we eliminating at each phase? Are we guaranteed that retaining and extending only the 10 commonest substitute prefixes of catched in will lead to one of the 10 commonest substitute prefixes of catched in the?

  <TITLE>3.4 Phonetic correction</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Phonetic correction phonetic Algorithms for such phonetic hashing are commonly collectively known as soundex algorithms. However, there is an original soundex algorithm, with various variants, built on the following scheme: Turn every term to be indexed into a 4-character reduced form. Build an inverted index from these reduced forms to the original terms; call this the soundex index. Do the same with query terms. When the query calls for a soundex match, search this soundex index. Retain the first letter of the term. Change all occurrences of the following letters to '0' (zero): 'A', E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'H', 'W', 'Y'. Change letters to digits as follows: B, F, P, V to 1. C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z to 2. D,T to 3. L to 4. M, N to 5. R to 6. Repeatedly remove one out of each pair of consecutive identical digits. Remove all zeros from the resulting string. Pad the resulting string with trailing zeros and return the first four positions, which will consist of a letter followed by three digits. For an example of a soundex map, Hermann maps to H655. Given a query (say herman), we compute its soundex code and then retrieve all vocabulary terms matching this soundex code from the soundex index, before running the resulting query on the standard inverted index. This algorithm rests on a few observations: (1) vowels are viewed as interchangeable, in transcribing names; (2) consonants with similar sounds (e.g., D and T) are put in equivalence classes. This leads to related names often having the same soundex codes. While these rules work for many cases, especially European languages, such rules tend to be writing system dependent. For example, Chinese names can be written in Wade-Giles or Pinyin transcription. While soundex works for some of the differences in the two transcriptions, for instance mapping both Wade-Giles hs and Pinyin x to 2, it fails in other cases, for example Wade-Giles j and Pinyin r are mapped differently. Exercises. Find two differently spelled proper nouns whose soundex codes are the same. Find two phonetically similar proper nouns whose soundex codes are different.

   References and further reading Knuth (1997) is a comprehensive source for information on search trees, including B-trees and their use in searching through dictionaries. Garfield (1976) gives one of the first complete descriptions of the permuterm index. Ferragina and Venturini (2007) give an approach to addressing the space blowup in permuterm indexes. One of the earliest formal treatments of spelling correction was due to Damerau (1964). The notion of edit distance that we have used is due to Levenshtein (1965) and the algorithm in Figure 3.5 is due to Wagner and Fischer (1974). Peterson (1980) and Kukich (1992) developed variants of methods based on edit distances, culminating in a detailed empirical study of several methods by Zobel and Dart (1995), which shows that -gram indexing is very effective for finding candidate mismatches, but should be combined with a more fine-grained technique such as edit distance to determine the most likely misspellings. Gusfield (1997) is a standard reference on string algorithms such as edit distance. Probabilistic models (``noisy channel'' models) for spelling correction were pioneered by Kernighan et al. (1990) and further developed by Brill and Moore (2000) and Toutanova and Moore (2002). In these models, the mis-spelled query is viewed as a probabilistic corruption of a correct query. They have a similar mathematical basis to the language model methods presented in Chapter 12 , and also provide ways of incorporating phonetic similarity, closeness on the keyboard, and data from the actual spelling mistakes of users. Many would regard them as the state-of-the-art approach. Cucerzan and Brill (2004) show how this work can be extended to learning spelling correction models based on query reformulations in search engine logs. The soundex algorithm is attributed to Margaret K. Odell and Robert C. Russelli (from U.S. patents granted in 1918 and 1922); the version described here draws on Bourne and Ford (1961). Zobel and Dart (1996) evaluate various phonetic matching algorithms, finding that a variant of the soundex algorithm performs poorly for general spelling correction, but that other algorithms based on the phonetic similarity of term pronunciations perform well.

  <TITLE>Chapter 4 Index construction</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Index construction In this chapter, we look at how to construct an inverted index. We call this process index construction or indexing ; the process or machine that performs it the indexer . The design of indexing algorithms is governed by hardware constraints. We therefore begin this chapter with a review of the basics of computer hardware that are relevant for indexing. We then introduce blocked sort-based indexing (Section 4.2 ), an efficient single-machine algorithm designed for static collections that can be viewed as a more scalable version of the basic sort-based indexing algorithm we introduced in Chapter 1 . Section 4.3 describes single-pass in-memory indexing, an algorithm that has even better scaling properties because it does not hold the vocabulary in memory. For very large collections like the web, indexing has to be distributed over computer clusters with hundreds or thousands of machines. We discuss this in Section 4.4 . Collections with frequent changes require dynamic indexing introduced in Section 4.5 so that changes in the collection are immediately reflected in the index. Finally, we cover some complicating issues that can arise in indexing - such as security and indexes for ranked retrieval - in Section 4.6 . Index construction interacts with several topics covered in other chapters. The indexer needs raw text, but documents are encoded in many ways (see Chapter 2 ). Indexers compress and decompress intermediate files and the final index (see Chapter 5 ). In web search, documents are not on a local file system, but have to be spidered or crawled (see Chapter 20 ). In enterprise search , most documents are encapsulated in varied content management systems, email applications, and databases. We give some examples in Section 4.7 . Although most of these applications can be accessed via http, native Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are usually more efficient. The reader should be aware that building the subsystem that feeds raw text to the indexing process can in itself be a challenging problem.

   Hardware basics   Table 4.1: Typical system parameters in 2007. The seek time is the time needed to position the disk head in a new position. The transfer time per byte is the rate of transfer from disk to memory when the head is in the right position.   Symbol Statistic Value     average seek time 5 ms s     transfer time per byte 0.02 s s       processor's clock rate     lowlevel operation             (e.g., compare   swap a word) 0.01 s s       size of main memory several GB       size of disk space 1 TB or more    When building an information retrieval (IR) system, many decisions are based on the characteristics of the computer hardware on which the system runs. We therefore begin this chapter with a brief review of computer hardware. Performance characteristics typical of systems in 2007 are shown in Table 4.1 . A list of hardware basics that we need in this book to motivate IR system design follows. Access to data in memory is much faster than access to data on disk. It takes a few clock cycles (perhaps seconds) to access a byte in memory, but much longer to transfer it from disk (about seconds). Consequently, we want to keep as much data as possible in memory, especially those data that we need to access frequently. We call the technique of keeping frequently used disk data in main memory caching . When doing a disk read or write, it takes a while for the disk head to move to the part of the disk where the data are located. This time is called the seek time and it averages 5 ms for typical disks. No data are being transferred during the seek. To maximize data transfer rates, chunks of data that will be read together should therefore be stored contiguously on disk. For example, using the numbers in Table 4.1 it may take as little as 0.2 seconds to transfer 10 megabytes (MB) from disk to memory if it is stored as one chunk, but up to seconds if it is stored in 100 noncontiguous chunks because we need to move the disk head up to 100 times. Operating systems generally read and write entire blocks. Thus, reading a single byte from disk can take as much time as reading the entire block. Block sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64 kilobytes (KB) are common. We call the part of main memory where a block being read or written is stored a buffer . Data transfers from disk to memory are handled by the system bus, not by the processor. This means that the processor is available to process data during disk I/O. We can exploit this fact to speed up data transfers by storing compressed data on disk. Assuming an efficient decompression algorithm, the total time of reading and then decompressing compressed data is usually less than reading uncompressed data. Servers used in IR systems typically have several gigabytes (GB) of main memory, sometimes tens of GB. Available disk space is several orders of magnitude larger.

  <TITLE>4.2 Blocked sort-based indexing</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Blocked sort-based indexing The basic steps in constructing a nonpositional index are depicted in Figure 1.4 (page ). We first make a pass through the collection assembling all term-docID pairs. We then sort the pairs with the term as the dominant key and docID as the secondary key. Finally, we organize the docIDs for each term into a postings list and compute statistics like term and document frequency. For small collections, all this can be done in memory. In this chapter, we describe methods for large collections that require the use of secondary storage. To make index construction more efficient, we represent terms as termIDs (instead of strings as we did in Figure 1.4 ), where each termID is a unique serial number. We can build the mapping from terms to termIDs on the fly while we are processing the collection; or, in a two-pass approach, we compile the vocabulary in the first pass and construct the inverted index in the second pass. The index construction algorithms described in this chapter all do a single pass through the data. Section 4.7 gives references to multipass algorithms that are preferable in certain applications, for example, when disk space is scarce. We work with the Reuters-RCV1 collection as our model collection in this chapter, a collection with roughly 1 GB of text. It consists of about 800,000 documents that were sent over the Reuters newswire during a 1-year period between August 20, 1996, and August 19, 1997. A typical document is shown in Figure 4.1 , but note that we ignore multimedia information like images in this book and are only concerned with text. Reuters-RCV1 covers a wide range of international topics, including politics, business, sports, and (as in this example) science. Some key statistics of the collection are shown in Table 4.2 . Reuters-RCV1 has 100 million tokens. Collecting all termID-docID pairs of the collection using 4 bytes each for termID and docID therefore requires 0.8 GB of storage. Typical collections today are often one or two orders of magnitude larger than Reuters-RCV1. You can easily see how such collections overwhelm even large computers if we try to sort their termID-docID pairs in memory. If the size of the intermediate files during index construction is within a small factor of available memory, then the compression techniques introduced in Chapter 5 can help; however, the postings file of many large collections cannot fit into memory even after compression.   Table: Collection statistics for Reuters-RCV1. Values are rounded for the computations in this book. The unrounded values are: 806,791 documents, 222 tokens per document, 391,523 (distinct) terms, 6.04 bytes per token with spaces and punctuation, 4.5 bytes per token without spaces and punctuation, 7.5 bytes per term, and 96,969,056 tokens. The numbers in this table correspond to the third line (``case folding'') in icompresstb5.   Symbol Statistic Value     documents 800,000     avg. # tokens per document 200     terms 400,000       avg. # bytes per token (incl. spaces/punct.) 6       avg. # bytes per token (without spaces/punct.) 4.5       avg. # bytes per term 7.5     tokens 100,000,000     Figure 4.1: Document from the Reuters newswire. With main memory insufficient, we need to use an external sorting algorithm , that is, one that uses disk. For acceptable speed, the central requirement of such an algorithm is that it minimize the number of random disk seeks during sorting - sequential disk reads are far faster than seeks as we explained in Section 4.1 . One solution is the blocked sort-based indexing algorithm or BSBI in Figure 4.2 . BSBI (i) segments the collection into parts of equal size, (ii) sorts the termID-docID pairs of each part in memory, (iii) stores intermediate sorted results on disk, and (iv) merges all intermediate results into the final index. The algorithm parses documents into termID-docID pairs and accumulates the pairs in memory until a block of a fixed size is full (PARSENEXTBLOCK in Figure 4.2 ). We choose the block size to fit comfortably into memory to permit a fast in-memory sort. The block is then inverted and written to disk. Inversion involves two steps. First, we sort the termID-docID pairs. Next, we collect all termID-docID pairs with the same termID into a postings list, where a posting is simply a docID. The result, an inverted index for the block we have just read, is then written to disk. Applying this to Reuters-RCV1 and assuming we can fit 10 million termID-docID pairs into memory, we end up with ten blocks, each an inverted index of one part of the collection.    Merging in blocked sort-based indexing.Two blocks (``postings lists to be merged'') are loaded from disk into memory, merged in memory (``merged postings lists'') and written back to disk. We show terms instead of termIDs for better readability. In the final step, the algorithm simultaneously merges the ten blocks into one large merged index. An example with two blocks is shown in Figure 4.3 , where we use to denote the document of the collection. To do the merging, we open all block files simultaneously, and maintain small read buffers for the ten blocks we are reading and a write buffer for the final merged index we are writing. In each iteration, we select the lowest termID that has not been processed yet using a priority queue or a similar data structure. All postings lists for this termID are read and merged, and the merged list is written back to disk. Each read buffer is refilled from its file when necessary. How expensive is BSBI? Its time complexity is because the step with the highest time complexity is sorting and is an upper bound for the number of items we must sort (i.e., the number of termID-docID pairs). But the actual indexing time is usually dominated by the time it takes to parse the documents (PARSENEXTBLOCK) and to do the final merge (MERGEBLOCKS). Exercise 4.6 asks you to compute the total index construction time for RCV1 that includes these steps as well as inverting the blocks and writing them to disk. Notice that Reuters-RCV1 is not particularly large in an age when one or more GB of memory are standard on personal computers. With appropriate compression (Chapter 5 ), we could have created an inverted index for RCV1 in memory on a not overly beefy server. The techniques we have described are needed, however, for collections that are several orders of magnitude larger. Exercises. If we need comparisons (where is the number of termID-docID pairs) and two disk seeks for each comparison, how much time would index construction for Reuters-RCV1 take if we used disk instead of memory for storage and an unoptimized sorting algorithm (i.e., not an external sorting algorithm)? Use the system parameters in Table 4.1 . How would you create the dictionary in blocked sort-based indexing on the fly to avoid an extra pass through the data?

  <TEXT>
   Single-pass in-memory indexing  single-pass in-memory indexing  SPIMI  Figure 4.4: Inversion of a block in single-pass in-memory indexing The SPIMI algorithm is shown in Figure 4.4 . The part of the algorithm that parses documents and turns them into a stream of term-docID pairs, which we call tokens here, has been omitted. SPIMI-INVERT is called repeatedly on the token stream until the entire collection has been processed. Tokens are processed one by one (line 4) during each successive call of SPIMI-INVERT. When a term occurs for the first time, it is added to the dictionary (best implemented as a hash), and a new postings list is created (line 6). The call in line 7 returns this postings list for subsequent occurrences of the term. A difference between BSBI and SPIMI is that SPIMI adds a posting directly to its postings list (line 10). Instead of first collecting all termID-docID pairs and then sorting them (as we did in BSBI), each postings list is dynamic (i.e., its size is adjusted as it grows) and it is immediately available to collect postings. This has two advantages: It is faster because there is no sorting required, and it saves memory because we keep track of the term a postings list belongs to, so the termIDs of postings need not be stored. As a result, the blocks that individual calls of SPIMI-INVERT can process are much larger and the index construction process as a whole is more efficient. Because we do not know how large the postings list of a term will be when we first encounter it, we allocate space for a short postings list initially and double the space each time it is full (lines 8-9). This means that some memory is wasted, which counteracts the memory savings from the omission of termIDs in intermediate data structures. However, the overall memory requirements for the dynamically constructed index of a block in SPIMI are still lower than in BSBI. When memory has been exhausted, we write the index of the block (which consists of the dictionary and the postings lists) to disk (line 12). We have to sort the terms (line 11) before doing this because we want to write postings lists in lexicographic order to facilitate the final merging step. If each block's postings lists were written in unsorted order, merging blocks could not be accomplished by a simple linear scan through each block. Each call of SPIMI-INVERT writes a block to disk, just as in BSBI. The last step of SPIMI (corresponding to line 7 in Figure 4.2 ; not shown in Figure 4.4 ) is then to merge the blocks into the final inverted index. In addition to constructing a new dictionary structure for each block and eliminating the expensive sorting step, SPIMI has a third important component: compression. Both the postings and the dictionary terms can be stored compactly on disk if we employ compression. Compression increases the efficiency of the algorithm further because we can process even larger blocks, and because the individual blocks require less space on disk. We refer readers to the literature for this aspect of the algorithm (Section 4.7 ). The time complexity of SPIMI is because no sorting of tokens is required and all operations are at most linear in the size of the collection.

  <TITLE>4.4 Distributed indexing</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Distributed indexing  clusters   distributed indexing  distributed index term-partitioned index . Most large search engines prefer a document-partitioned index (which can be easily generated from a term-partitioned index). We discuss this topic further in Section 20.3 (page ). The distributed index construction method we describe in this section is an application of MapReduce , a general architecture for distributed computing. MapReduce is designed for large computer clusters. The point of a cluster is to solve large computing problems on cheap commodity machines or nodes that are built from standard parts (processor, memory, disk) as opposed to on a supercomputer with specialized hardware. Although hundreds or thousands of machines are available in such clusters, individual machines can fail at any time. One requirement for robust distributed indexing is, therefore, that we divide the work up into chunks that we can easily assign and - in case of failure - reassign. A master node directs the process of assigning and reassigning tasks to individual worker nodes. The map and reduce phases of MapReduce split up the computing job into chunks that standard machines can process in a short time. The various steps of MapReduce are shown in Figure 4.5 and an example on a collection consisting of two documents is shown in Figure 4.6 . First, the input data, in our case a collection of web pages, are split into splits where the size of the split is chosen to ensure that the work can be distributed evenly (chunks should not be too large) and efficiently (the total number of chunks we need to manage should not be too large); 16 or 64 MB are good sizes in distributed indexing. Splits are not preassigned to machines, but are instead assigned by the master node on an ongoing basis: As a machine finishes processing one split, it is assigned the next one. If a machine dies or becomes a laggard due to hardware problems, the split it is working on is simply reassigned to another machine.  Figure 4.5: An example of distributed indexing with MapReduce. Adapted from Dean and Ghemawat (2004). In general, MapReduce breaks a large computing problem into smaller parts by recasting it in terms of manipulation of key-value pairs . For indexing, a key-value pair has the form (termID,docID). In distributed indexing, the mapping from terms to termIDs is also distributed and therefore more complex than in single-machine indexing. A simple solution is to maintain a (perhaps precomputed) mapping for frequent terms that is copied to all nodes and to use terms directly (instead of termIDs) for infrequent terms. We do not address this problem here and assume that all nodes share a consistent term termID mapping. The map phase of MapReduce consists of mapping splits of the input data to key-value pairs. This is the same parsing task we also encountered in BSBI and SPIMI, and we therefore call the machines that execute the map phase parsers . Each parser writes its output to local intermediate files, the segment files (shown as in Figure 4.5 ). For the reduce phase , we want all values for a given key to be stored close together, so that they can be read and processed quickly. This is achieved by partitioning the keys into term partitions and having the parsers write key-value pairs for each term partition into a separate segment file. In Figure 4.5 , the term partitions are according to first letter: a-f, g-p, q-z, and . (We chose these key ranges for ease of exposition. In general, key ranges need not correspond to contiguous terms or termIDs.) The term partitions are defined by the person who operates the indexing system (Exercise 4.6 ). The parsers then write corresponding segment files, one for each term partition. Each term partition thus corresponds to segments files, where is the number of parsers. For instance, Figure 4.5 shows three a-f segment files of the a-f partition, corresponding to the three parsers shown in the figure. Collecting all values (here: docIDs) for a given key (here: termID) into one list is the task of the inverters in the reduce phase. The master assigns each term partition to a different inverter - and, as in the case of parsers, reassigns term partitions in case of failing or slow inverters. Each term partition (corresponding to segment files, one on each parser) is processed by one inverter. We assume here that segment files are of a size that a single machine can handle (Exercise 4.6 ). Finally, the list of values is sorted for each key and written to the final sorted postings list (``postings'' in the figure). (Note that postings in Figure 4.6 include term frequencies, whereas each posting in the other sections of this chapter is simply a docID without term frequency information.) The data flow is shown for a-f in Figure 4.5 . This completes the construction of the inverted index. Parsers and inverters are not separate sets of machines. The master identifies idle machines and assigns tasks to them. The same machine can be a parser in the map phase and an inverter in the reduce phase. And there are often other jobs that run in parallel with index construction, so in between being a parser and an inverter a machine might do some crawling or another unrelated task. To minimize write times before inverters reduce the data, each parser writes its segment files to its local disk. In the reduce phase, the master communicates to an inverter the locations of the relevant segment files (e.g., of the segment files of the a-f partition). Each segment file only requires one sequential read because all data relevant to a particular inverter were written to a single segment file by the parser. This setup minimizes the amount of network traffic needed during indexing.  Map and reduce functions in MapReduce. In general, the map function produces a list of key-value pairs. All values for a key are collected into one list in the reduce phase. This list is then processed further. The instantiations of the two functions and an example are shown for index construction. Because the map phase processes documents in a distributed fashion, termID-docID pairs need not be ordered correctly initially as in this example. The example shows terms instead of termIDs for better readability. We abbreviate Caesar as C and conquered as c'ed. Figure 4.6 shows the general schema of the MapReduce functions. Input and output are often lists of key-value pairs themselves, so that several MapReduce jobs can run in sequence. In fact, this was the design of the Google indexing system in 2004. What we describe in this section corresponds to only one of five to ten MapReduce operations in that indexing system. Another MapReduce operation transforms the term-partitioned index we just created into a document-partitioned one. MapReduce offers a robust and conceptually simple framework for implementing index construction in a distributed environment. By providing a semiautomatic method for splitting index construction into smaller tasks, it can scale to almost arbitrarily large collections, given computer clusters of sufficient size. Exercises. For splits, segments, and term partitions, how long would distributed index creation take for Reuters-RCV1 in a MapReduce architecture? Base your assumptions about cluster machines on Table 4.1 .

   Dynamic indexing Thus far, we have assumed that the document collection is static. This is fine for collections that change infrequently or never (e.g., the Bible or Shakespeare). But most collections are modified frequently with documents being added, deleted, and updated. This means that new terms need to be added to the dictionary, and postings lists need to be updated for existing terms. The simplest way to achieve this is to periodically reconstruct the index from scratch. This is a good solution if the number of changes over time is small and a delay in making new documents searchable is acceptable - and if enough resources are available to construct a new index while the old one is still available for querying. If there is a requirement that new documents be included quickly, one solution is to maintain two indexes: a large main index and a small auxiliary index that stores new documents. The auxiliary index is kept in memory. Searches are run across both indexes and results merged. Deletions are stored in an invalidation bit vector. We can then filter out deleted documents before returning the search result. Documents are updated by deleting and reinserting them. Each time the auxiliary index becomes too large, we merge it into the main index. The cost of this merging operation depends on how we store the index in the file system. If we store each postings list as a separate file, then the merge simply consists of extending each postings list of the main index by the corresponding postings list of the auxiliary index. In this scheme, the reason for keeping the auxiliary index is to reduce the number of disk seeks required over time. Updating each document separately requires up to disk seeks, where is the average size of the vocabulary of documents in the collection. With an auxiliary index, we only put additional load on the disk when we merge auxiliary and main indexes. Unfortunately, the one-file-per-postings-list scheme is infeasible because most file systems cannot efficiently handle very large numbers of files. The simplest alternative is to store the index as one large file, that is, as a concatenation of all postings lists. In reality, we often choose a compromise between the two extremes (Section 4.7 ). To simplify the discussion, we choose the simple option of storing the index as one large file here. In this scheme, we process each posting times because we touch it during each of merges where is the size of the auxiliary index and the total number of postings. Thus, the overall time complexity is . (We neglect the representation of terms here and consider only the docIDs. For the purpose of time complexity, a postings list is simply a list of docIDs.)  Figure: Logarithmic merging. Each token (termID,docID) is initially added to in-memory index by LM ERGEA DDT OKEN. L OGARITHMICM ERGE initializes and . We can do better than by introducing indexes , , , ...of size , , .... Postings percolate up this sequence of indexes and are processed only once on each level. This scheme is called logarithmic merging (Figure 4.7 ). As before, up to postings are accumulated in an in-memory auxiliary index, which we call . When the limit is reached, the postings in are transferred to a new index that is created on disk. The next time is full, it is merged with to create an index of size . Then is either stored as (if there isn't already an ) or merged with into (if exists); and so on. We service search requests by querying in-memory and all currently valid indexes on disk and merging the results. Readers familiar with the binomial heap data structure will recognize its similarity with the structure of the inverted indexes in logarithmic merging. Overall index construction time is because each posting is processed only once on each of the levels. We trade this efficiency gain for a slow down of query processing; we now need to merge results from indexes as opposed to just two (the main and auxiliary indexes). As in the auxiliary index scheme, we still need to merge very large indexes occasionally (which slows down the search system during the merge), but this happens less frequently and the indexes involved in a merge on average are smaller. Having multiple indexes complicates the maintenance of collection-wide statistics. For example, it affects the spelling correction algorithm in Section 3.3 (page ) that selects the corrected alternative with the most hits. With multiple indexes and an invalidation bit vector, the correct number of hits for a term is no longer a simple lookup. In fact, all aspects of an IR system - index maintenance, query processing, distribution, and so on - are more complex in logarithmic merging. Because of this complexity of dynamic indexing, some large search engines adopt a reconstruction-from-scratch strategy. They do not construct indexes dynamically. Instead, a new index is built from scratch periodically. Query processing is then switched from the new index and the old index is deleted. Exercises. For and , perform a step-by-step simulation of the algorithm in Figure 4.7 . Create a table that shows, for each point in time at which tokens have been processed ( ), which of the three indexes are in use.

  <TITLE>4.6 Other types of indexes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Other types of indexes In the indexes we have considered so far, postings lists are ordered with respect to docID. As we see in Chapter 5, this is advantageous for compression - instead of docIDs we can compress smaller gaps between IDs, thus reducing space requirements for the index. However, this structure for the index is not optimal when we build ranked (Chapters 6 7 ) - as opposed to Boolean - retrieval systems . In ranked retrieval, postings are often ordered according to weight or impact , with the highest-weighted postings occurring first. With this organization, scanning of long postings lists during query processing can usually be terminated early when weights have become so small that any further documents can be predicted to be of low similarity to the query (see Chapter 6 ). In a docID-sorted index, new documents are always inserted at the end of postings lists. In an impact-sorted index impactordered, the insertion can occur anywhere, thus complicating the update of the inverted index. Security is an important consideration for retrieval systems in corporations. A low-level employee should not be able to find the salary roster of the corporation, but authorized managers need to be able to search for it. Users' results lists must not contain documents they are barred from opening; the very existence of a document can be sensitive information.  Figure: A user-document matrix for access control lists. Element is 1 if user has access to document and 0 otherwise. During query processing, a user's access postings list is intersected with the results list returned by the text part of the index. User authorization is often mediated through access control lists or ACLs. ACLs can be dealt with in an information retrieval system by representing each document as the set of users that can access them (Figure 4.8 ) and then inverting the resulting user-document matrix. The inverted ACL index has, for each user, a ``postings list'' of documents they can access - the user's access list. Search results are then intersected with this list. However, such an index is difficult to maintain when access permissions change - we discussed these difficulties in the context of incremental indexing for regular postings lists in Section 4.5. It also requires the processing of very long postings lists for users with access to large document subsets. User membership is therefore often verified by retrieving access information directly from the file system at query time - even though this slows down retrieval. We discussed indexes for storing and retrieving terms (as opposed to documents) in Chapter 3 . Exercises. Can spelling correction compromise document-level security? Consider the case where a spelling correction is based on documents to which the user does not have access. Exercises. Total index construction time in blocked sort-based indexing is broken down in Table 4.3. Fill out the time column of the table for Reuters-RCV1 assuming a system with the parameters given in Table 4.1 . Table: The five steps in constructing an index for Reuters-RCV1 in blocked sort-based indexing.

Choose a block size that is realistic for current technology (remember that a block should easily fit into main memory). How many blocks do you need? Assume that we have a collection of modest size whose index can be constructed with the simple in-memory indexing algorithm in Figure 1.4 (page ). For this collection, compare memory, disk and time requirements of the simple algorithm in Figure 1.4 and blocked sort-based indexing. Assume that machines in MapReduce have 100 GB of disk space each. Assume further that the postings list of the term the has a size of 200 GB. Then the MapReduce algorithm as described cannot be run to construct the index. How would you modify MapReduce so that it can handle this case? For optimal load balancing, the inverters in MapReduce must get segmented postings files of similar sizes. For a new collection, the distribution of key-value pairs may not be known in advance. How would you solve this problem? Apply MapReduce to the problem of counting how often each term occurs in a set of files. Specify map and reduce operations for this task. Write down an example along the lines of Figure 4.6 . We claimed (on page 4.5 ) that an auxiliary index can impair the quality of collection statistics. An example is the term weighting method idf , which is defined as where is the total number of documents and is the number of documents that term occurs in idf. Show that even a small auxiliary index can cause significant error in idf when it is computed on the main index only. Consider a rare term that suddenly occurs frequently (e.g., Flossie as in Tropical Storm Flossie).

   References and further reading Witten et al. (1999, Chapter 5) present an extensive treatment of the subject of index construction and additional indexing algorithms with different tradeoffs of memory, disk space, and time. In general, blocked sort-based indexing does well on all three counts. However, if conserving memory or disk space is the main criterion, then other algorithms may be a better choice. See Witten et al. (1999), Tables 5.4 and 5.5; BSBI is closest to ``sort-based multiway merge,'' but the two algorithms differ in dictionary structure and use of compression. Moffat and Bell (1995) show how to construct an index ``in situ,'' that is, with disk space usage close to what is needed for the final index and with a minimum of additional temporary files (cf. also Harman and Candela (1990)). They give Lesk (1988) and Somogyi (1990) credit for being among the first to employ sorting for index construction. The SPIMI method in Section 4.3 is from (Heinz and Zobel, 2003). We have simplified several aspects of the algorithm, including compression and the fact that each term's data structure also contains, in addition to the postings list, its document frequency and house keeping information. We recommend Heinz and Zobel (2003) and Zobel and Moffat (2006) as up-do-date, in-depth treatments of index construction. Other algorithms with good scaling properties with respect to vocabulary size require several passes through the data, e.g., FAST-INV (Harman et al., 1992, Fox and Lee, 1991). The MapReduce architecture was introduced by Dean and Ghemawat (2004). An open source implementation of MapReduce is available at http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/. Ribeiro-Neto et al. (1999) and Melnik et al. (2001) describe other approaches to distributed indexing. Introductory chapters on distributed IR are (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, Chapter 9) and (Grossman and Frieder, 2004, Chapter 8). See also Callan (2000). Lester et al. (2005) and Büttcher and Clarke (2005a) analyze the properties of logarithmic merging and compare it with other construction methods. One of the first uses of this method was in Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org). Other dynamic indexing methods are discussed by Büttcher et al. (2006) and Lester et al. (2006). The latter paper also discusses the strategy of replacing the old index by one built from scratch. Heinz et al. (2002) compare data structures for accumulating the vocabulary in memory. Büttcher and Clarke (2005b) discuss security models for a common inverted index for multiple users. A detailed characterization of the Reuters-RCV1 collection can be found in (Lewis et al., 2004). NIST distributes the collection (see http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html). Garcia-Molina et al. (1999, Chapter 2) review computer hardware relevant to system design in depth. An effective indexer for enterprise search needs to be able to communicate efficiently with a number of applications that hold text data in corporations, including Microsoft Outlook, IBM's Lotus software, databases like Oracle and MySQL, content management systems like Open Text, and enterprise resource planning software like SAP.

  <TITLE>Chapter 5 Index compression</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Index compression Chapter 1 introduced the dictionary and the inverted index as the central data structures in information retrieval (IR). In this chapter, we employ a number of compression techniques for dictionary and inverted index that are essential for efficient IR systems. One benefit of compression is immediately clear. We need less disk space. As we will see, compression ratios of 1:4 are easy to achieve, potentially cutting the cost of storing the index by 75%. There are two more subtle benefits of compression. The first is increased use of caching. Search systems use some parts of the dictionary and the index much more than others. For example, if we cache the postings list of a frequently used query term , then the computations necessary for responding to the one-term query can be entirely done in memory. With compression, we can fit a lot more information into main memory. Instead of having to expend a disk seek when processing a query with , we instead access its postings list in memory and decompress it. As we will see below, there are simple and efficient decompression methods, so that the penalty of having to decompress the postings list is small. As a result, we are able to decrease the response time of the IR system substantially. Because memory is a more expensive resource than disk space, increased speed owing to caching - rather than decreased space requirements - is often the prime motivator for compression. The second more subtle advantage of compression is faster transfer of data from disk to memory. Efficient decompression algorithms run so fast on modern hardware that the total time of transferring a compressed chunk of data from disk and then decompressing it is usually less than transferring the same chunk of data in uncompressed form. For instance, we can reduce input/output (I/O) time by loading a much smaller compressed postings list, even when you add on the cost of decompression. So, in most cases, the retrieval system runs faster on compressed postings lists than on uncompressed postings lists. If the main goal of compression is to conserve disk space, then the speed of compression algorithms is of no concern. But for improved cache utilization and faster disk-to-memory transfer, decompression speeds must be high. The compression algorithms we discuss in this chapter are highly efficient and can therefore serve all three purposes of index compression. In this chapter, we define a posting as a docID in a postings list. For example, the postings list (6; 20, 45, 100), where 6 is the termID of the list's term, contains three postings. As discussed in Section 2.4.2 (page ), postings in most search systems also contain frequency and position information; but we will only consider simple docID postings here. See Section 5.4 for references on compressing frequencies and positions. This chapter first gives a statistical characterization of the distribution of the entities we want to compress - terms and postings in large collections (Section 5.1 ). We then look at compression of the dictionary, using the dictionary-as-a-string method and blocked storage (Section 5.2 ). Section 5.3 describes two techniques for compressing the postings file, variable byte encoding and encoding.

  <TITLE>5.1 Statistical properties of terms in information retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Statistical properties of terms in information retrieval As in the last chapter, we use Reuters-RCV1 as our model collection (see Table 4.2 , page 4.2 ). We give some term and postings statistics for the collection in Table 5.1 . ``'' indicates the reduction in size from the previous line. ``T%'' is the cumulative reduction from unfiltered. The table shows the number of terms for different levels of preprocessing (column 2). The number of terms is the main factor in determining the size of the dictionary. The number of nonpositional postings (column 3) is an indicator of the expected size of the nonpositional index of the collection. The expected size of a positional index is related to the number of positions it must encode (column 4). In general, the statistics in Table 5.1 show that preprocessing affects the size of the dictionary and the number of nonpositional postings greatly. Stemming and case folding reduce the number of (distinct) terms by 17% each and the number of nonpositional postings by 4% and 3%, respectively. The treatment of the most frequent words is also important. The rule of 30 states that the 30 most common words account for 30% of the tokens in written text (31% in the table). Eliminating the 150 most common words from indexing (as stop words; cf. Section 2.2.2 , page 2.2.2 ) cuts 25% to 30% of the nonpositional postings. But, although a stop list of 150 words reduces the number of postings by a quarter or more, this size reduction does not carry over to the size of the compressed index. As we will see later in this chapter, the postings lists of frequent words require only a few bits per posting after compression.   Table 5.1: The effect of preprocessing on the number of terms, nonpositional postings, and tokens for Reuters-RCV1. `` '' indicates the reduction in size from the previous line, except that ``30 stop words'' and ``150 stop words'' both use ``case folding'' as their reference line. ``T%'' is the cumulative (``total'') reduction from unfiltered. We performed stemming with the Porter stemmer (Chapter 2 , page 2.2.4 ).                 tokens (number of position       (distinct) terms nonpositional postings entries in postings)                   number T% number T% number T%     unfiltered 484,494     109,971,179     197,879,290         no numbers 473,723 2 2 100,680,242 8 8 179,158,204 9 9     case folding 391,523 17 19 96,969,056 3 12 179,158,204 0 9     30 stop words 391,493 0 19 83,390,443 14 24 121,857,825 31 38     150 stop words 391,373 0 19 67,001,847 30 39 94,516,599 47 52     stemming 322,383 17 33 63,812,300 4 42 94,516,599 0 52    The deltas in the table are in a range typical of large collections. Note, however, that the percentage reductions can be very different for some text collections. For example, for a collection of web pages with a high proportion of French text, a lemmatizer for French reduces vocabulary size much more than the Porter stemmer does for an English-only collection because French is a morphologically richer language than English. The compression techniques we describe in the remainder of this chapter are lossless , that is, all information is preserved. Better compression ratios can be achieved with lossy compression , which discards some information. Case folding, stemming, and stop word elimination are forms of lossy compression. Similarly, the vector space model (Chapter 6 ) and dimensionality reduction techniques like latent semantic indexing (Chapter 18 ) create compact representations from which we cannot fully restore the original collection. Lossy compression makes sense when the ``lost'' information is unlikely ever to be used by the search system. For example, web search is characterized by a large number of documents, short queries, and users who only look at the first few pages of results. As a consequence, we can discard postings of documents that would only be used for hits far down the list. Thus, there are retrieval scenarios where lossy methods can be used for compression without any reduction in effectiveness. Before introducing techniques for compressing the dictionary, we want to estimate the number of distinct terms in a collection. It is sometimes said that languages have a vocabulary of a certain size. The second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines more than 600,000 words. But the vocabulary of most large collections is much larger than the OED. The OED does not include most names of people, locations, products, or scientific entities like genes. These names need to be included in the inverted index, so our users can search for them.   Subsections Heaps' law: Estimating the number of terms Zipf's law: Modeling the distribution of terms

A better way of getting a handle on is Heaps' law , which estimates vocabulary size as a function of collection size: (1)       5.1     (2)  The parameter is quite variable because vocabulary growth depends a lot on the nature of the collection and how it is processed. Case-folding and stemming reduce the growth rate of the vocabulary, whereas including numbers and spelling errors increase it. Regardless of the values of the parameters for a particular collection, Heaps' law suggests that (i) the dictionary size continues to increase with more documents in the collection, rather than a maximum vocabulary size being reached, and (ii) the size of the dictionary is quite large for large collections. These two hypotheses have been empirically shown to be true of large text collections (Section 5.4 ). So dictionary compression is important for an effective information retrieval system.

   Zipf's law: Modeling the distribution of terms 5.3 A commonly used model of the distribution of terms in a collection is Zipf's law . It states that, if is the most common term in the collection, is the next most common, and so on, then the collection frequency of the th most common term is proportional to :     (3)    3 Equivalently, we can write Zipf's law as or as where and is a constant to be defined in Section 5.3.2 .

Frequency is plotted as a function of frequency rank for the terms in the collection. The line is the distribution predicted by Zipf's law (weighted least-squares fit; intercept is 6.95). The log-log graph in Figure 5.2 plots the collection frequency of a term as a function of its rank for Reuters-RCV1. A line with slope -1, corresponding to the Zipf function , is also shown. The fit of the data to the law is not particularly good, but good enough to serve as a model for term distributions in our calculations in Section 5.3 . Exercises.

  <TITLE>5.2 Dictionary compression</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Dictionary compression This section presents a series of dictionary data structures that achieve increasingly higher compression ratios. The dictionary is small compared with the postings file as suggested by Table 5.1 . So why compress it if it is responsible for only a small percentage of the overall space requirements of the IR system? One of the primary factors in determining the response time of an IR system is the number of disk seeks necessary to process a query. If parts of the dictionary are on disk, then many more disk seeks are necessary in query evaluation. Thus, the main goal of compressing the dictionary is to fit it in main memory, or at least a large portion of it, to support high query throughput. Although dictionaries of very large collections fit into the memory of a standard desktop machine, this is not true of many other application scenarios. For example, an enterprise search server for a large corporation may have to index a multiterabyte collection with a comparatively large vocabulary because of the presence of documents in many different languages. We also want to be able to design search systems for limited hardware such as mobile phones and onboard computers. Other reasons for wanting to conserve memory are fast startup time and having to share resources with other applications. The search system on your PC must get along with the memory-hogging word processing suite you are using at the same time.  Figure 5.3: Storing the dictionary as an array of fixed-width entries.

  <TITLE>5.2.1 Dictionary as a string</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Dictionary as a string 5.3  For Reuters-RCV1, we need for storing the dictionary in this scheme.  Dictionary-as-a-string storage.Pointers mark the end of the preceding term and the beginning of the next. For example, the first three terms in this example are systile, syzygetic, and syzygial. Using fixed-width entries for terms is clearly wasteful. The average length of a term in English is about eight characters icompresstb1, so on average we are wasting twelve characters (or 24 bytes) in the fixed-width scheme. Also, we have no way of storing terms with more than twenty characters like hydrochlorofluorocarbons and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. We can overcome these shortcomings by storing the dictionary terms as one long string of characters, as shown in Figure 5.4 . The pointer to the next term is also used to demarcate the end of the current term. As before, we locate terms in the data structure by way of binary search in the (now smaller) table. This scheme saves us 60% compared to fixed-width storage - 24 bytes on average of the 40 bytes 12 bytes on average of the 20 bytes we allocated for terms before. However, we now also need to store term pointers. The term pointers resolve positions, so they need to be bits or 3 bytes long. In this new scheme, we need for the Reuters-RCV1 dictionary: 4 bytes each for frequency and postings pointer, 3 bytes for the term pointer, and bytes on average for the term. So we have reduced the space requirements by one third from 19.211.2 to 10.87.6 MB.  Blocked storage with four terms per block.The first block consists of systile, syzygetic, syzygial, and syzygy with lengths of seven, nine, eight, and six characters, respectively. Each term is preceded by a byte encoding its length that indicates how many bytes to skip to reach subsequent terms.

  <TEXT>
   Blocked storage   5.5        Figure 5.6: Search of the uncompressed dictionary (a) and a dictionary compressed by blocking with (b). By increasing the block size , we get better compression. However, there is a tradeoff between compression and the speed of term lookup. For the eight-term dictionary in Figure 5.6 , steps in binary search are shown as double lines and steps in list search as simple lines. We search for terms in the uncompressed dictionary by binary search (a). In the compressed dictionary, we first locate the term's block by binary search and then its position within the list by linear search through the block (b). Searching the uncompressed dictionary in (a) takes on average steps, assuming each term is equally likely to come up in a query. For example, finding the two terms, aid and box, takes three and two steps, respectively. With blocks of size in (b), we need steps on average, more. For example, finding den takes one binary search step and two steps through the block. By increasing , we can get the size of the compressed dictionary arbitrarily close to the minimum of , but term lookup becomes prohibitively slow for large values of .   One source of redundancy in the dictionary we have not exploited yet is the fact that consecutive entries in an alphabetically sorted list share common prefixes. This observation leads to front coding (Figure 5.7 ). A common prefix is identified for a subsequence of the term list and then referred to with a special character. In the case of Reuters, front coding saves another 2.41.2 MB, as we found in an experiment. Other schemes with even greater compression rely on minimal perfect hashing, that is, a hash function that maps terms onto without collisions. However, we cannot adapt perfect hashes incrementally because each new term causes a collision and therefore requires the creation of a new perfect hash function. Therefore, they cannot be used in a dynamic environment. Even with the best compression scheme, it may not be feasible to store the entire dictionary in main memory for very large text collections and for hardware with limited memory. If we have to partition the dictionary onto pages that are stored on disk, then we can index the first term of each page using a B-tree. For processing most queries, the search system has to go to disk anyway to fetch the postings. One additional seek for retrieving the term's dictionary page from disk is a significant, but tolerable increase in the time it takes to process a query.

These numbers correspond to line 3 (``case folding'') in Table 5.1 . Document identifiers are bits long. Thus, the size of the collection is about and the size of the uncompressed postings file is . To devise a more efficient representation of the postings file, one that uses fewer than 20 bits per document, we observe that the postings for frequent terms are close together. Imagine going through the documents of a collection one by one and looking for a frequent term like computer. We will find a document containing computer, then we skip a few documents that do not contain it, then there is again a document with the term and so on (see Table 5.3 ). The key idea is that the gaps between postings are short, requiring a lot less space than 20 bits to store. In fact, gaps for the most frequent terms such as the and for are mostly equal to 1. But the gaps for a rare term that occurs only once or twice in a collection (e.g., arachnocentric in Table 5.3 ) have the same order of magnitude as the docIDs and need 20 bits. For an economical representation of this distribution of gaps, we need a variable encoding method that uses fewer bits for short gaps. To encode small numbers in less space than large numbers, we look at two types of methods: bytewise compression and bitwise compression. As the names suggest, these methods attempt to encode gaps with the minimum number of bytes and bits, respectively.   Subsections Variable byte codes Gamma codes

   Variable byte codes     VB encoding. Gaps are encoded using an integral number of bytes. The first bit, the continuation bit, of each byte indicates whether the code ends with this byte (1) or not (0).   docIDs 824 829 215406       gaps   5 214577       VB code 00000110 10111000 10000101 00001101 00001100 10110001      Variable byte (VB) encoding uses an integral number of bytes to encode a gap. The last 7 bits of a byte are ``payload'' and encode part of the gap. The first bit of the byte is a continuation bit . It is set to 1 for the last byte of the encoded gap and to 0 otherwise. To decode a variable byte code, we read a sequence of bytes with continuation bit 0 terminated by a byte with continuation bit 1. We then extract and concatenate the 7-bit parts. Figure 5.8 gives pseudocode for VB encoding and decoding and Table 5.4 an example of a VB-encoded postings list. With VB compression, the size of the compressed index for Reuters-RCV1 is 116 MB as we verified in an experiment. This is a more than 50% reduction of the size of the uncompressed index (see Table 5.6 ). The idea of VB encoding can also be applied to larger or smaller units than bytes: 32-bit words, 16-bit words, and 4-bit words or nibbles . Larger words further decrease the amount of bit manipulation necessary at the cost of less effective (or no) compression. Word sizes smaller than bytes get even better compression ratios at the cost of more bit manipulation. In general, bytes offer a good compromise between compression ratio and speed of decompression. For most IR systems variable byte codes offer an excellent tradeoff between time and space. They are also simple to implement - most of the alternatives referred to in Section 5.4 are more complex. But if disk space is a scarce resource, we can achieve better compression ratios by using bit-level encodings, in particular two closely related encodings: codes, which we will turn to next, and codes (Exercise 5.3.2 ).

Bit-level codes adapt the length of the code on the finer grained bit level. The simplest bit-level code is unary code . The unary code of is a string of 1s followed by a 0 (see the first two columns of Table 5.5 ). Obviously, this is not a very efficient code, but it will come in handy in a moment. How efficient can a code be in principle? Assuming the gaps with are all equally likely, the optimal encoding uses bits for each . So some gaps ( in this case) cannot be encoded with fewer than bits. Our goal is to get as close to this lower bound as possible. A method that is within a factor of optimal is encoding . codes implement variable-length encoding by splitting the representation of a gap into a pair of length and offset. Offset is in binary, but with the leading 1 removed. For example, for 13 (binary 1101) offset is 101. Length encodes the length of offset in unary code. For 13, the length of offset is 3 bits, which is 1110 in unary. The code of 13 is therefore 1110101, the concatenation of length 1110 and offset 101. The right hand column of Table 5.5 gives additional examples of codes. A code is decoded by first reading the unary code up to the 0 that terminates it, for example, the four bits 1110 when decoding 1110101. Now we know how long the offset is: 3 bits. The offset 101 can then be read correctly and the 1 that was chopped off in encoding is prepended: 101 1101 = 13. The length of offset is bits and the length of length is bits, so the length of the entire code is bits. codes are always of odd length and they are within a factor of 2 of what we claimed to be the optimal encoding length . We derived this optimum from the assumption that the gaps between and are equiprobable. But this need not be the case. In general, we do not know the probability distribution over gaps a priori.  Figure 5.9: Entropy as a function of for a sample space with two outcomes and .      entropy   (4)    5.9         It can be shown that the lower bound for the expected length of a code is if certain conditions hold (see the references). It can further be shown that for , encoding is within a factor of 3 of this optimal encoding, approaching 2 for large : (5)        universal In addition to universality, codes have two other properties that are useful for index compression. First, they are prefix free , namely, no code is the prefix of another. This means that there is always a unique decoding of a sequence of codes - and we do not need delimiters between them, which would decrease the efficiency of the code. The second property is that codes are parameter free . For many other efficient codes, we have to fit the parameters of a model (e.g., the binomial distribution) to the distribution of gaps in the index. This complicates the implementation of compression and decompression. For instance, the parameters need to be stored and retrieved. And in dynamic indexing, the distribution of gaps can change, so that the original parameters are no longer appropriate. These problems are avoided with a parameter-free code. How much compression of the inverted index do codes achieve? To answer this question we use Zipf's law, the term distribution model introduced in Section 5.1.2 . According to Zipf's law, the collection frequency is proportional to the inverse of the rank , that is, there is a constant such that:     (6)       (7)     (8)         harmonic number     (9)       (10)  4.2  Figure 5.10: Stratification of terms for estimating the size of a encoded inverted index.            5.10 Encoding the gaps of size with codes, the number of bits needed for the postings list of a term in the th block (corresponding to one row in the figure) is:            (11)   For Reuters-RCV1, 400,000 and (12)  When we run compression on Reuters-RCV1, the actual size of the compressed index is even lower: 101 MB, a bit more than one tenth of the size of the collection. The reason for the discrepancy between predicted and actual value is that (i) Zipf's law is not a very good approximation of the actual distribution of term frequencies for Reuters-RCV1 and (ii) gaps are not uniform. The Zipf model predicts an index size of 251 MB for the unrounded numbers from Table 4.2 . If term frequencies are generated from the Zipf model and a compressed index is created for these artificial terms, then the compressed size is 254 MB. So to the extent that the assumptions about the distribution of term frequencies are accurate, the predictions of the model are correct.   Table: Index and dictionary compression for Reuters-RCV1. The compression ratio depends on the proportion of actual text in the collection. Reuters-RCV1 contains a large amount of XML markup. Using the two best compression schemes, encoding and blocking with front coding, the ratio compressed index to collection size is therefore especially small for Reuters-RCV1: . .   data structure size in MB   dictionary, fixed-width 19.211.2   dictionary, term pointers into string 10.8 7.6   , with blocking, 10.3 7.1   , with blocking   front coding 7.9 5.9   collection (text, xml markup etc) 3600.0   collection (text) 960.0   term incidence matrix 40,000.0   postings, uncompressed (32-bit words) 400.0   postings, uncompressed (20 bits) 250.0   postings, variable byte encoded 116.0   postings, encoded 101.0  Table 5.6 summarizes the compression techniques covered in this chapter. The term incidence matrix (Figure 1.1 , page 1.1 ) for Reuters-RCV1 has size bits or 40 GB. The numbers were the collection (3600 MB and 960 MB) are for the encoding of RCV1 of CD, which uses one byte per character, not Unicode. codes achieve great compression ratios - about 15% better than variable byte codes for Reuters-RCV1. But they are expensive to decode. This is because many bit-level operations - shifts and masks - are necessary to decode a sequence of codes as the boundaries between codes will usually be somewhere in the middle of a machine word. As a result, query processing is more expensive for codes than for variable byte codes. Whether we choose variable byte or encoding depends on the characteristics of an application, for example, on the relative weights we give to conserving disk space versus maximizing query response time. The compression ratio for the index in Table 5.6 is about 25%: 400 MB (uncompressed, each posting stored as a 32-bit word) versus 101 MB () and 116 MB (VB). This shows that both and VB codes meet the objectives we stated in the beginning of the chapter. Index compression substantially improves time and space efficiency of indexes by reducing the amount of disk space needed, increasing the amount of information that can be kept in the cache, and speeding up data transfers from disk to memory. Exercises. Compute variable byte codes for the numbers in Tables 5.3 5.5 . Compute variable byte and codes for the postings list 777, 17743, 294068, 31251336. Use gaps instead of docIDs where possible. Write binary codes in 8-bit blocks. Consider the postings list with a corresponding list of gaps . Assume that the length of the postings list is stored separately, so the system knows when a postings list is complete. Using variable byte encoding: (i) What is the largest gap you can encode in 1 byte? (ii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 2 bytes? (iii) How many bytes will the above postings list require under this encoding? (Count only space for encoding the sequence of numbers.) A little trick is to notice that a gap cannot be of length 0 and that the stuff left to encode after shifting cannot be 0. Based on these observations: (i) Suggest a modification to variable byte encoding that allows you to encode slightly larger gaps in the same amount of space. (ii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 1 byte? (iii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 2 bytes? (iv) How many bytes will the postings list in Exercise 5.3.2 require under this encoding? (Count only space for encoding the sequence of numbers.) From the following sequence of -coded gaps, reconstruct first the gap sequence and then the postings sequence: 1110001110101011111101101111011. codes are relatively inefficient for large numbers (e.g., 1025 in Table 5.5 ) as they encode the length of the offset in inefficient unary code. codes differ from codes in that they encode the first part of the code (length) in code instead of unary code. The encoding of offset is the same. For example, the code of 7 is 10,0,11 (again, we add commas for readability). 10,0 is the code for length (2 in this case) and the encoding of offset (11) is unchanged. (i) Compute the codes for the other numbers in Table 5.5 . For what range of numbers is the code shorter than the code? (ii) code beats variable byte code in Table 5.6 because the index contains stop words and thus many small gaps. Show that variable byte code is more compact if larger gaps dominate. (iii) Compare the compression ratios of code and variable byte code for a distribution of gaps dominated by large gaps. Go through the above calculation of index size and explicitly state all the approximations that were made to arrive at Equation 11. For a collection of your choosing, determine the number of documents and terms and the average length of a document. (i) How large is the inverted index predicted to be by Equation 11? (ii) Implement an indexer that creates a -compressed inverted index for the collection. How large is the actual index? (iii) Implement an indexer that uses variable byte encoding. How large is the variable byte encoded index?

A detailed study of vocabulary growth in large collections is (Williams and Zobel, 2005). Zipf's law is due to Zipf (1949). Witten and Bell (1990) investigate the quality of the fit obtained by the law. Other term distribution models, including K mixture and two-poisson model, are discussed by Manning and Schütze (1999, Chapter 15). Carmel et al. (2001), Büttcher and Clarke (2006), Blanco and Barreiro (2007), and Ntoulas and Cho (2007) show that lossy compression can achieve good compression with no or no significant decrease in retrieval effectiveness. Dictionary compression is covered in detail by Witten et al. (1999, Chapter 4), which is recommended as additional reading. Subsection 5.3.1 is based on (Scholer et al., 2002). The authors find that variable byte codes process queries two times faster than either bit-level compressed indexes or uncompressed indexes with a 30% penalty in compression ratio compared with the best bit-level compression method. They also show that compressed indexes can be superior to uncompressed indexes not only in disk usage, but also in query processing speed. Compared with VB codes, ``variable nibble'' codes showed 5% to 10% better compression and up to one third worse effectiveness in one experiment (Anh and Moffat, 2005). Trotman (2003) also recommends using VB codes unless disk space is at a premium. In recent work, Anh and Moffat (2006a;2005) and Zukowski et al. (2006) have constructed word-aligned binary codes that are both faster in decompression and at least as efficient as VB codes. Zhang et al. (2007) investigate the increased effectiveness of caching when a number of different compression techniques for postings lists are used on modern hardware. codes (Exercise 5.3.2 ) and codes were introduced by Elias (1975), who proved that both codes are universal. In addition, codes are asymptotically optimal for . codes perform better than codes if large numbers (greater than 15) dominate. A good introduction to information theory, including the concept of entropy , is (Cover and Thomas, 1991). While Elias codes are only asymptotically optimal, arithmetic codes (Witten et al., 1999, Section 2.4) can be constructed to be arbitrarily close to the optimum for any . Several additional index compression techniques are covered by Witten et al. (1999; Sections 3.3 and 3.4 and Chapter 5). They recommend using parameterized codes for index compression, codes that explicitly model the probability distribution of gaps for each term. For example, they show that Golomb codes achieve better compression ratios than codes for large collections. Moffat and Zobel (1992) compare several parameterized methods, including LLRUN (Fraenkel and Klein, 1985). The distribution of gaps in a postings list depends on the assignment of docIDs to documents. A number of researchers have looked into assigning docIDs in a way that is conducive to the efficient compression of gap sequences (Moffat and Stuiver, 1996; Blandford and Blelloch, 2002; Silvestri et al., 2004; Blanco and Barreiro, 2006; Silvestri, 2007). These techniques assign docIDs in a small range to documents in a cluster where a cluster can consist of all documents in a given time period, on a particular web site, or sharing another property. As a result, when a sequence of documents from a cluster occurs in a postings list, their gaps are small and can be more effectively compressed. Different considerations apply to the compression of term frequencies and word positions than to the compression of docIDs in postings lists. See Scholer et al. (2002) and Zobel and Moffat (2006). Zobel and Moffat (2006) is recommended in general as an in-depth and up-to-date tutorial on inverted indexes, including index compression. This chapter only looks at index compression for Boolean retrieval. For ranked retrieval (Chapter 6 ), it is advantageous to order postings according to term frequency instead of docID. During query processing, the scanning of many postings lists can then be terminated early because smaller weights do not change the ranking of the highest ranked documents found so far. It is not a good idea to precompute and store weights in the index (as opposed to frequencies) because they cannot be compressed as well as integers (see impactordered). Document compression can also be important in an efficient information retrieval system. de Moura et al. (2000) and Brisaboa et al. (2007) describe compression schemes that allow direct searching of terms and phrases in the compressed text, which is infeasible with standard text compression utilities like gzip and compress. Exercises. We have defined unary codes as being ``10'': sequences of 1s terminated by a 0. Interchanging the roles of 0s and 1s yields an equivalent ``01'' unary code. When this 01 unary code is used, the construction of a code can be stated as follows: (1) Write down in binary using bits. (2) Prepend 0s. (i) Encode the numbers in Table 5.5 in this alternative code. (ii) Show that this method produces a well-defined alternative code in the sense that it has the same length and can be uniquely decoded. Unary code is not a universal code in the sense defined above. However, there exists a distribution over gaps for which unary code is optimal. Which distribution is this? Give some examples of terms that violate the assumption that gaps all have the same size (which we made when estimating the space requirements of a -encoded index). What are general characteristics of these terms? Consider a term whose postings list has size , say, . Compare the size of the -compressed gap-encoded postings list if the distribution of the term is uniform (i.e., all gaps have the same size) versus its size when the distribution is not uniform. Which compressed postings list is smaller? Work out the sum in Equation 12 and show it adds up to about 251 MB. Use the numbers in Table 4.2 , but do not round , , and the number of vocabulary blocks.

  <TITLE>Chapter 6 Scoring, term weighting and the vector space model</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Scoring, term weighting and the vector space model Thus far we have dealt with indexes that support Boolean queries: a document either matches or does not match a query. In the case of large document collections, the resulting number of matching documents can far exceed the number a human user could possibly sift through. Accordingly, it is essential for a search engine to rank-order the documents matching a query. To do this, the search engine computes, for each matching document, a score with respect to the query at hand. In this chapter we initiate the study of assigning a score to a (query, document) pair. This chapter consists of three main ideas. We introduce parametric and zone indexes in Section 6.1 , which serve two purposes. First, they allow us to index and retrieve documents by metadata such as the language in which a document is written. Second, they give us a simple means for scoring (and thereby ranking) documents in response to a query. Next, in Section 6.2 we develop the idea of weighting the importance of a term in a document, based on the statistics of occurrence of the term. In Section 6.3 we show that by viewing each document as a vector of such weights, we can compute a score between a query and each document. This view is known as vector space scoring. 6.4 7 As we develop these ideas, the notion of a query will assume multiple nuances. In Section 6.1 we consider queries in which specific query terms occur in specified regions of a matching document. Beginning Section 6.2 we will in fact relax the requirement of matching specific regions of a document; instead, we will look at so-called free text queries that simply consist of query terms with no specification on their relative order, importance or where in a document they should be found. The bulk of our study of scoring will be in this latter notion of a query being such a set of terms.

  <TITLE>6.1 Parametric and zone indexes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Parametric and zone indexes We have thus far viewed a document as a sequence of terms. In fact, most documents have additional structure. Digital documents generally encode, in machine-recognizable form, certain metadata associated with each document. By metadata, we mean specific forms of data about a document, such as its author(s), title and date of publication. This metadata would generally include fields such as the date of creation and the format of the document, as well the author and possibly the title of the document. The possible values of a field should be thought of as finite - for instance, the set of all dates of authorship. Consider queries of the form ``find documents authored by William Shakespeare in 1601, containing the phrase alas poor Yorick''. Query processing then consists as usual of postings intersections, except that we may merge postings from standard inverted as well as parametric indexes . There is one parametric index for each field (say, date of creation); it allows us to select only the documents matching a date specified in the query. Figure 6.1 illustrates the user's view of such a parametric search. Some of the fields may assume ordered values, such as dates; in the example query above, the year 1601 is one such field value. The search engine may support querying ranges on such ordered values; to this end, a structure like a B-tree may be used for the field's dictionary.  Parametric search.In this example we have a collection with fields allowing us to select publications by zones such as Author and fields such as Language. Zones are similar to fields, except the contents of a zone can be arbitrary free text. Whereas a field may take on a relatively small set of values, a zone can be thought of as an arbitrary, unbounded amount of text. For instance, document titles and abstracts are generally treated as zones. We may build a separate inverted index for each zone of a document, to support queries such as ``find documents with merchant in the title and william in the author list and the phrase gentle rain in the body''. This has the effect of building an index that looks like Figure 6.2. Whereas the dictionary for a parametric index comes from a fixed vocabulary (the set of languages, or the set of dates), the dictionary for a zone index must structure whatever vocabulary stems from the text of that zone.   In fact, we can reduce the size of the dictionary by encoding the zone in which a term occurs in the postings. In Figure 6.3 for instance, we show how occurrences of william in the title and author zones of various documents are encoded. Such an encoding is useful when the size of the dictionary is a concern (because we require the dictionary to fit in main memory). But there is another important reason why the encoding of Figure 6.3 is useful: the efficient computation of scores using a technique we will call weighted zone scoring .

  <TITLE>6.1.1 Weighted zone scoring</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Weighted zone scoring 6.1 Given a Boolean query and a document , weighted zone scoring assigns to the pair a score in the interval , by computing a linear combination of zone scores, where each zone of the document contributes a Boolean value. More specifically, consider a set of documents each of which has zones. Let such that . For , let be the Boolean score denoting a match (or absence thereof) between and the th zone. For instance, the Boolean score from a zone could be 1 if all the query term(s) occur in that zone, and zero otherwise; indeed, it could be any Boolean function that maps the presence of query terms in a zone to . Then, the weighted zone score is defined to be (13)   ranked Boolean retrieval Worked example. Consider the query shakespeare in a collection in which each document has three zones: author, title and body. The Boolean score function for a zone takes on the value 1 if the query term shakespeare is present in the zone, and zero otherwise. Weighted zone scoring in such a collection would require three weights and , respectively corresponding to the author, title and body zones. Suppose we set and (so that the three weights add up to 1); this corresponds to an application in which a match in the author zone is least important to the overall score, the title zone somewhat more, and the body contributes even more. Thus if the term shakespeare were to appear in the title and body zones but not the author zone of a document, the score of this document would be 0.8. End worked example. How do we implement the computation of weighted zone scores? A simple approach would be to compute the score for each document in turn, adding in all the contributions from the various zones. However, we now show how we may compute weighted zone scores directly from inverted indexes. The algorithm of Figure 6.4 treats the case when the query is a two-term query consisting of query terms and , and the Boolean function is AND: 1 if both query terms are present in a zone and 0 otherwise. Following the description of the algorithm, we describe the extension to more complex queries and Boolean functions.   The reader may have noticed the close similarity between this algorithm and that in Figure 1.6 . Indeed, they represent the same postings traversal, except that instead of merely adding a document to the set of results for a Boolean AND query, we now compute a score for each such document. Some literature refers to the array scores[] above as a set of accumulators . The reason for this will be clear as we consider more complex Boolean functions than the AND; thus we may assign a non-zero score to a document even if it does not contain all query terms.

  <TITLE>6.1.2 Learning weights</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Learning weights   machine-learned relevance 15  We are provided with a set of training examples, each of which is a tuple consisting of a query and a document , together with a relevance judgment for on . In the simplest form, each relevance judgments is either Relevant or Non-relevant. More sophisticated implementations of the methodology make use of more nuanced judgments. The weights are then ``learned'' from these examples, in order that the learned scores approximate the relevance judgments in the training examples. For weighted zone scoring, the process may be viewed as learning a linear function of the Boolean match scores contributed by the various zones. The expensive component of this methodology is the labor-intensive assembly of user-generated relevance judgments from which to learn the weights, especially in a collection that changes frequently (such as the Web). We now detail a simple example that illustrates how we can reduce the problem of learning the weights to a simple optimization problem. We now consider a simple case of weighted zone scoring, where each document has a title zone and a body zone. Given a query and a document , we use the given Boolean match function to compute Boolean variables and , depending on whether the title (respectively, body) zone of matches query . For instance, the algorithm in Figure 6.4 uses an AND of the query terms for this Boolean function. We will compute a score between 0 and 1 for each (document, query) pair using and by using a constant , as follows:  (14)   training examples      Relevant Non-relevant 6.5 Figure 6.5: An illustration of training examples. For each training example we have Boolean values and that we use to compute a score from (14)  (15)   Relevant Non-relevant   (16)      (17)    17 Picking the best value of in (17) in the formulation of Section 6.1.3 reduces to the problem of minimizing a quadratic function of over the interval .

  <TITLE>6.2 Term frequency and weighting</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Term frequency and weighting  free text query 1.4 Towards this end, we assign to each term in a document a weight for that term, that depends on the number of occurrences of the term in the document. We would like to compute a score between a query term  and a document , based on the weight of in . The simplest approach is to assign the weight to be equal to the number of occurrences of term  in document . This weighting scheme is referred to as term frequency and is denoted , with the subscripts denoting the term and the document in order. For a document , the set of weights determined by the weights above (or indeed any weighting function that maps the number of occurrences of in to a positive real value) may be viewed as a quantitative digest of that document. In this view of a document, known in the literature as the bag of words model , the exact ordering of the terms in a document is ignored but the number of occurrences of each term is material (in contrast to Boolean retrieval). We only retain information on the number of occurrences of each term. Thus, the document ``Mary is quicker than John'' is, in this view, identical to the document ``John is quicker than Mary''. Nevertheless, it seems intuitive that two documents with similar bag of words representations are similar in content. We will develop this intuition further in Section 6.3 . Before doing so we first study the question: are all words in a document equally important? Clearly not; in Section 2.2.2 (page ) we looked at the idea of stop words - words that we decide not to index at all, and therefore do not contribute in any way to retrieval and scoring.

  <TEXT>
   Inverse document frequency collection frequency,  Instead, it is more commonplace to use for this purpose the document frequency , defined to be the number of documents in the collection that contain a term . This is because in trying to discriminate between documents for the purpose of scoring it is better to use a document-level statistic (such as the number of documents containing a term) than to use a collection-wide statistic for the term. Figure 6.7: Collection frequency (cf) and document frequency (df) behave differently, as in this example from the Reuters collection. 6.7 How is the document frequency df of a term used to scale its weight? Denoting as usual the total number of documents in a collection by , we define the inverse document frequency of a term as follows:  (21)  Thus the idf of a rare term is high, whereas the idf of a frequent term is likely to be low. Figure 6.8 gives an example of idf's in the Reuters collection of 806,791 documents; in this example logarithms are to the base 10. In fact, as we will see in Exercise 6.2.2 , the precise base of the logarithm is not material to ranking. We will give on page 11.3.3 a justification of the particular form in Equation 21.

  <TITLE>6.2.2 Tf-idf weighting</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Tf-idf weighting We now combine the definitions of term frequency and inverse document frequency, to produce a composite weight for each term in each document. The tf-idf weighting scheme assigns to term a weight in document given by  (22)  In other words, assigns to term a weight in document that is  highest when occurs many times within a small number of documents (thus lending high discriminating power to those documents); lower when the term occurs fewer times in a document, or occurs in many documents (thus offering a less pronounced relevance signal); lowest when the term occurs in virtually all documents. At this point, we may view each document as a vector with one component corresponding to each term in the dictionary, together with a weight for each component that is given by (22). For dictionary terms that do not occur in a document, this weight is zero. This vector form will prove to be crucial to scoring and ranking; we will develop these ideas in Section 6.3 . As a first step, we introduce the overlap score measure: the score of a document is the sum, over all query terms, of the number of times each of the query terms occurs in . We can refine this idea so that we add up not the number of occurrences of each query term in , but instead the tf-idf weight of each term in . (23)  6.3 23 Exercises. Why is the idf of a term always finite? What is the idf of a term that occurs in every document? Compare this with the use of stop word lists. Consider the table of term frequencies for 3 documents denoted Doc1, Doc2, Doc3 in Figure 6.9 . Figure 6.9: Table of tf values for Exercise  6.2.2. Compute the tf-idf weights for the terms car, auto, insurance, best, for each document, using the idf values from Figure 6.8 . Can the tf-idf weight of a term in a document exceed 1? How does the base of the logarithm in (21) affect the score calculation in (23)? How does the base of the logarithm affect the relative scores of two documents on a given query? If the logarithm in (21) is computed base 2, suggest a simple approximation to the idf of a term.

   The vector space model for scoring In Section 6.2 (page ) we developed the notion of a document vector that captures the relative importance of the terms in a document. The representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector space is known as the vector space model and is fundamental to a host of information retrieval operations ranging from scoring documents on a query, document classification and document clustering. We first develop the basic ideas underlying vector space scoring; a pivotal step in this development is the view (Section 6.3.2 ) of queries as vectors in the same vector space as the document collection.

  <TEXT>
   Dot products    6.2  bag of words How do we quantify the similarity between two documents in this vector space? A first attempt might consider the magnitude of the vector difference between two document vectors. This measure suffers from a drawback: two documents with very similar content can have a significant vector difference simply because one is much longer than the other. Thus the relative distributions of terms may be identical in the two documents, but the absolute term frequencies of one may be far larger.        cosine similarity      (24)   dot product  inner product     Euclidean lengths         The effect of the denominator of Equation 24 is thus to length-normalize the vectors and to unit vectors and . We can then rewrite (24) as (25)  Worked example. Consider the documents in Figure 6.9 . We now apply Euclidean normalization to the tf values from the table, for each of the three documents in the table. The quantity has the values 30.56, 46.84 and 41.30 respectively for Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3. The resulting Euclidean normalized tf values for these documents are shown in Figure 6.11 .  Figure 6.11: Euclidean normalized tf values for documents in Figure 6.9 . End worked example. Thus, (25) can be viewed as the dot product of the normalized versions of the two document vectors. This measure is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, shown in Figure 6.10 . What use is the similarity measure ? Given a document (potentially one of the in the collection), consider searching for the documents in the collection most similar to . Such a search is useful in a system where a user may identify a document and seek others like it - a feature available in the results lists of search engines as a more like this feature. We reduce the problem of finding the document(s) most similar to to that of finding the with the highest dot products ( values) . We could do this by computing the dot products between and each of , then picking off the highest resulting values.   Worked example. Figure 6.12 shows the number of occurrences of three terms (affection, jealous and gossip) in each of the following three novels: Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility (SaS) and Pride and Prejudice (PaP) and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (WH). Of course, there are many other terms occurring in each of these novels. In this example we represent each of these novels as a unit vector in three dimensions, corresponding to these three terms (only); we use raw term frequencies here, with no idf multiplier. The resulting weights are as shown in Figure 6.13.   Now consider the cosine similarities between pairs of the resulting three-dimensional vectors. A simple computation shows that sim((SAS), (PAP)) is 0.999, whereas sim((SAS), (WH)) is 0.888; thus, the two books authored by Austen (SaS and PaP) are considerably closer to each other than to Brontë's Wuthering Heights. In fact, the similarity between the first two is almost perfect (when restricted to the three terms we consider). Here we have considered tf weights, but we could of course use other term weight functions. End worked example. Viewing a collection of documents as a collection of vectors leads to a natural view of a collection as a term-document matrix and jealousy would under stemming be considered as a single dimension. This matrix view will prove to be useful in Chapter 18 .

  <TITLE>6.3.2 Queries as vectors</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Queries as vectors There is a far more compelling reason to represent documents as vectors: we can also view a query as a vector. Consider the query jealous gossip. This query turns into the unit vector on the three coordinates of Figures 6.12 and 6.13. The key idea now: to assign to each document a score equal to the dot product (26)  In the example of Figure 6.13, Wuthering Heights is the top-scoring document for this query with a score of 0.509, with Pride and Prejudice a distant second with a score of 0.085, and Sense and Sensibility last with a score of 0.074. This simple example is somewhat misleading: the number of dimensions in practice will be far larger than three: it will equal the vocabulary size . To summarize, by viewing a query as a ``bag of words'', we are able to treat it as a very short document. As a consequence, we can use the cosine similarity between the query vector and a document vector as a measure of the score of the document for that query. The resulting scores can then be used to select the top-scoring documents for a query. Thus we have (27)  6.3.2 6.4 Computing the cosine similarities between the query vector and each document vector in the collection, sorting the resulting scores and selecting the top documents can be expensive -- a single similarity computation can entail a dot product in tens of thousands of dimensions, demanding tens of thousands of arithmetic operations. In Section 7.1 we study how to use an inverted index for this purpose, followed by a series of heuristics for improving on this. Worked example. We now consider the query best car insurance on a fictitious collection with documents where the document frequencies of auto, best, car and insurance are respectively 5000, 50000, 10000 and 1000.  term query document product   tf df idf tf wf   auto 0 5000 2.3 0 1 1 0.41 0 best 1 50000 1.3 1.3 0 0 0 0 car 1 10000 2.0 2.0 1 1 0.41 0.82 insurance 1 1000 3.0 3.0 2 2 0.82 2.46 In this example the weight of a term in the query is simply the idf (and zero for a term not in the query, such as auto); this is reflected in the column header (the entry for auto is zero because the query does not contain the termauto). For documents, we use tf weighting with no use of idf but with Euclidean normalization. The former is shown under the column headed wf, while the latter is shown under the column headed . Invoking (23) now gives a net score of . End worked example.

  <TEXT>
   Computing vector scores  free text query      7  Figure 6.14: The basic algorithm for computing vector space scores. Figure 6.14 gives the basic algorithm for computing vector space scores. The array Length holds the lengths (normalization factors) for each of the documents, whereas the array Scores holds the scores for each of the documents. When the scores are finally computed in Step 9, all that remains in Step 10 is to pick off the documents with the highest scores. The outermost loop beginning Step 3 repeats the updating of Scores, iterating over each query term in turn. In Step 5 we calculate the weight in the query vector for term . Steps 6-8 update the score of each document by adding in the contribution from term . This process of adding in contributions one query term at a time is sometimes known as term-at-a-time scoring or accumulation, and the elements of the array are therefore known as accumulators . For this purpose, it would appear necessary to store, with each postings entry, the weight of term in document (we have thus far used either tf or tf-idf for this weight, but leave open the possibility of other functions to be developed in Section 6.4 ). In fact this is wasteful, since storing this weight may require a floating point number. Two ideas help alleviate this space problem. First, if we are using inverse document frequency , we need not precompute ; it suffices to store at the head of the postings for . Second, we store the term frequency for each postings entry. Finally, Step 12 extracts the top scores - this requires a priority queue data structure, often implemented using a heap. Such a heap takes no more than comparisons to construct, following which each of the top scores can be extracted from the heap at a cost of comparisons. Note that the general algorithm of Figure 6.14 does not prescribe a specific implementation of how we traverse the postings lists of the various query terms; we may traverse them one term at a time as in the loop beginning at Step 3, or we could in fact traverse them concurrently as in Figure 1.6 . In such a concurrent postings traversal we compute the scores of one document at a time, so that it is sometimes called document-at-a-time scoring. We will say more about this in Section 7.1.5 . Exercises. If we were to stem jealous and jealousy to a common stem before setting up the vector space, detail how the definitions of tf and idf should be modified. Recall the tf-idf weights computed in Exercise 6.2.2. Compute the Euclidean normalized document vectors for each of the documents, where each vector has four components, one for each of the four terms. Verify that the sum of the squares of the components of each of the document vectors in Exercise 6.3.3 is 1 (to within rounding error). Why is this the case? With term weights as computed in Exercise 6.3.3, rank the three documents by computed score for the query car insurance, for each of the following cases of term weighting in the query: The weight of a term is 1 if present in the query, 0 otherwise. Euclidean normalized idf.

More generally, a document in which the most frequent term appears roughly as often as many other terms should be treated differently from one with a more skewed distribution.

  <TEXT>
   Document and query weighting schemes Equation 27 is fundamental to information retrieval systems that use any form of vector space scoring. Variations from one vector space scoring method to another hinge on the specific choices of weights in the vectors and . Figure 6.15 lists some of the principal weighting schemes in use for each of and , together with a mnemonic for representing a specific combination of weights; this system of mnemonics is sometimes called SMART notation, following the authors of an early text retrieval system. The mnemonic for representing a combination of weights takes the form ddd.qqq where the first triplet gives the term weighting of the document vector, while the second triplet gives the weighting in the query vector. The first letter in each triplet specifies the term frequency component of the weighting, the second the document frequency component, and the third the form of normalization used. It is quite common to apply different normalization functions to and . For example, a very standard weighting scheme is lnc.ltc, where the document vector has log-weighted term frequency, no idf (for both effectiveness and efficiency reasons), and cosine normalization, while the query vector uses log-weighted term frequency, idf weighting, and cosine normalization.

  <TITLE>6.4.4 Pivoted normalized document length</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Pivoted normalized document length In Section 6.3.1 we normalized each document vector by the Euclidean length of the vector, so that all document vectors turned into unit vectors. In doing so, we eliminated all information on the length of the original document; this masks some subtleties about longer documents. First, longer documents will - as a result of containing more terms - have higher tf values. Second, longer documents contain more distinct terms. These factors can conspire to raise the scores of longer documents, which (at least for some information needs) is unnatural. Longer documents can broadly be lumped into two categories: (1) verbose documents that essentially repeat the same content - in these, the length of the document does not alter the relative weights of different terms; (2) documents covering multiple different topics, in which the search terms probably match small segments of the document but not all of it - in this case, the relative weights of terms are quite different from a single short document that matches the query terms. Compensating for this phenomenon is a form of document length normalization that is independent of term and document frequencies. To this end, we introduce a form of normalizing the vector representations of documents in the collection, so that the resulting ``normalized'' documents are not necessarily of unit length. Then, when we compute the dot product score between a (unit) query vector and such a normalized document, the score is skewed to account for the effect of document length on relevance. This form of compensation for document length is known as pivoted document length normalization .  Figure 6.16: Pivoted document length normalization. Consider a document collection together with an ensemble of queries for that collection. Suppose that we were given, for each query and for each document , a Boolean judgment of whether or not is relevant to the query ; in Chapter 8 we will see how to procure such a set of relevance judgments for a query ensemble and a document collection. Given this set of relevance judgments, we may compute a probability of relevance as a function of document length, averaged over all queries in the ensemble. The resulting plot may look like the curve drawn in thick lines in Figure 6.16 . To compute this curve, we bucket documents by length and compute the fraction of relevant documents in each bucket, then plot this fraction against the median document length of each bucket. (Thus even though the ``curve'' in Figure 6.16 appears to be continuous, it is in fact a histogram of discrete buckets of document length.) On the other hand, the curve in thin lines shows what might happen with the same documents and query ensemble if we were to use relevance as prescribed by cosine normalization Equation 27 - thus, cosine normalization has a tendency to distort the computed relevance vis-à-vis the true relevance, at the expense of longer documents. The thin and thick curves crossover at a point corresponding to document length , which we refer to as the pivot length; dashed lines mark this point on the and axes. The idea of pivoted document length normalization would then be to ``rotate'' the cosine normalization curve counter-clockwise about so that it more closely matches thick line representing the relevance vs. document length curve. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, we do so by using in Equation 27 a normalization factor for each document vector that is not the Euclidean length of that vector, but instead one that is larger than the Euclidean length for documents of length less than , and smaller for longer documents. To this end, we first note that the normalizing term for in the denominator of Equation 27 is its Euclidean length, denoted . In the simplest implementation of pivoted document length normalization, we use a normalization factor in the denominator that is linear in , but one of slope as in Figure 6.17 . In this figure, the axis represents , while the axis represents possible normalization factors we can use. The thin line depicts the use of cosine normalization. Notice the following aspects of the thick line representing pivoted length normalization: It is linear in the document length and has the form (31) where is the cosine normalization value at which the two curves intersect. Its slope is and (3) it crosses the line at piv. 31  (32)     Figure 6.17: Implementing pivoted document length normalization by linear scaling. Of course, pivoted document length normalization is not appropriate for all applications. For instance, in a collection of answers to frequently asked questions (say, at a customer service website), relevance may have little to do with document length. In other cases the dependency may be more complex than can be accounted for by a simple linear pivoted normalization. In such cases, document length can be used as a feature in the machine learning based scoring approach of Section 6.1.2 . Exercises. One measure of the similarity of two vectors is the Euclidean distance (or distance ) between them: (33) Given a query and documents , we may rank the documents in order of increasing Euclidean distance from . Show that if and the are all normalized to unit vectors, then the rank ordering produced by Euclidean distance is identical to that produced by cosine similarities. Compute the vector space similarity between the query ``digital cameras'' and the document ``digital cameras and video cameras'' by filling out the empty columns in Table 6.1 . Assume , logarithmic term weighting (wf columns) for query and document, idf weighting for the query only and cosine normalization for the document only. Treat and as a stop word. Enter term counts in the tf columns. What is the final similarity score? Table 6.1: Cosine computation for Exercise 6.4.4 .   query document   word tf wf df idf tf wf digital     10,000             video     100,000             cameras     50,000             Show that for the query affection, the relative ordering of the scores of the three documents in Figure 6.13 is the reverse of the ordering of the scores for the query jealous gossip. In turning a query into a unit vector in Figure 6.13, we assigned equal weights to each of the query terms. What other principled approaches are plausible? Consider the case of a query term that is not in the set of indexed terms; thus our standard construction of the query vector results in not being in the vector space created from the collection. How would one adapt the vector space representation to handle this case? Refer to the tf and idf values for four terms and three documents in Exercise 6.2.2. Compute the two top scoring documents on the query best car insurance for each of the following weighing schemes: (i) nnn.atc; (ii) ntc.atc. Suppose that the word coyote does not occur in the collection used in Exercises 6.2.2 and 6.4.4. How would one compute ntc.atc scores for the query coyote insurance?

   References and further reading Chapter 7 develops the computational aspects of vector space scoring. Luhn (1957;1958) describes some of the earliest reported applications of term weighting. His paper dwells on the importance of medium frequency terms (terms that are neither too commonplace nor too rare) and may be thought of as anticipating tf-idf and related weighting schemes. Spärck Jones (1972) builds on this intuition through detailed experiments showing the use of inverse document frequency in term weighting. A series of extensions and theoretical justifications of idf are due to Salton and Buckley (1987) Robertson and Jones (1976), Croft and Harper (1979) and Papineni (2001). Robertson maintains a web page (http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ser/idf.html) containing the history of idf, including soft copies of early papers that predated electronic versions of journal article. Singhal et al. (1996a) develop pivoted document length normalization. Probabilistic language models (Chapter 11 ) develop weighting techniques that are more nuanced than tf-idf; the reader will find this development in Section 11.4.3 . We observed that by assigning a weight for each term in a document, a document may be viewed as a vector of term weights, one for each term in the collection. The SMART information retrieval system at Cornell (Salton, 1971b) due to Salton and colleagues was perhaps the first to view a document as a vector of weights. The basic computation of cosine scores as described in Section 6.3.3 is due to Zobel and Moffat (2006). The two query evaluation strategies term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time are discussed by Turtle and Flood (1995). The SMART notation for tf-idf term weighting schemes in Figure 6.15 is presented in (Singhal et al., 1996b;1995, Salton and Buckley, 1988). Not all versions of the notation are consistent; we most closely follow (Singhal et al., 1996b). A more detailed and exhaustive notation was developed in Moffat and Zobel (1998), considering a larger palette of schemes for term and document frequency weighting. Beyond the notation, Moffat and Zobel (1998) sought to set up a space of feasible weighting functions through which hill-climbing approaches could be used to begin with weighting schemes that performed well, then make local improvements to identify the best combinations. However, they report that such hill-climbing methods failed to lead to any conclusions on the best weighting schemes.

   Computing scores in a complete search system Chapter 6 developed the theory underlying term weighting in documents for the purposes of scoring, leading up to vector space models and the basic cosine scoring algorithm of Section 6.3.3 (page ). In this chapter we begin in Section 7.1 with heuristics for speeding up this computation; many of these heuristics achieve their speed at the risk of not finding quite the top documents matching the query. Some of these heuristics generalize beyond cosine scoring. With Section 7.1 in place, we have essentially all the components needed for a complete search engine. We therefore take a step back from cosine scoring, to the more general problem of computing scores in a search engine. In Section 7.2 we outline a complete search engine, including indexes and structures to support not only cosine scoring but also more general ranking factors such as query term proximity. We describe how all of the various pieces fit together in Section 7.2.4 . We conclude this chapter with Section 7.3 , where we discuss how the vector space model for free text queries interacts with common query operators.

In the absence of any weighting for query terms, these non-zero components are equal - in this case, both equal 0.707. For the purpose of ranking the documents matching this query, we are really interested in the relative (rather than absolute) scores of the documents in the collection. To this end, it suffices to compute the cosine similarity from each document unit vector to (in which all non-zero components of the query vector are set to 1), rather than to the unit vector . For any two documents (34)      6.14  7.1  6.3.3   Figure 7.1: A faster algorithm for vector space scores. Given these scores, the final step before presenting results to a user is to pick out the highest-scoring documents. While one could sort the complete set of scores, a better approach is to use a heap to retrieve only the top documents in order. Where is the number of documents with non-zero cosine scores, constructing such a heap can be performed in comparison steps, following which each of the highest scoring documents can be ``read off'' the heap with comparison steps.

  <TITLE>7.1.1 Inexact top K document retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Inexact top K document retrieval Thus far, we have focused on retrieving precisely the highest-scoring documents for a query. We now consider schemes by which we produce documents that are likely to be among the highest scoring documents for a query. In doing so, we hope to dramatically lower the cost of computing the documents we output, without materially altering the user's perceived relevance of the top results. Consequently, in most applications it suffices to retrieve documents whose scores are very close to those of the best. In the sections that follow we detail schemes that retrieve such documents while potentially avoiding computing scores for most of the documents in the collection. Such inexact top- retrieval is not necessarily, from the user's perspective, a bad thing. The top documents by the cosine measure are in any case not necessarily the best for the query: cosine similarity is only a proxy for the user's perceived relevance. In Sections 7.1.2 -7.1.6 below, we give heuristics using which we are likely to retrieve documents with cosine scores close to those of the top documents. The principal cost in computing the output stems from computing cosine similarities between the query and a large number of documents. Having a large number of documents in contention also increases the selection cost in the final stage of culling the top documents from a heap. We now consider a series of ideas designed to eliminate a large number of documents without computing their cosine scores. The heuristics have the following two-step scheme: Find a set of documents that are contenders, where . does not necessarily contain the top-scoring documents for the query, but is likely to have many documents with scores near those of the top . Return the top-scoring documents in .

  <TITLE>7.1.2 Index elimination</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Index elimination  We only consider documents containing terms whose idf exceeds a preset threshold. Thus, in the postings traversal, we only traverse the postings for terms with high idf. This has a fairly significant benefit: the postings lists of low-idf terms are generally long; with these removed from contention, the set of documents for which we compute cosines is greatly reduced. One way of viewing this heuristic: low-idf terms are treated as stop words and do not contribute to scoring. For instance, on the query catcher in the rye, we only traverse the postings for catcher and rye. The cutoff threshold can of course be adapted in a query-dependent manner. We only consider documents that contain many (and as a special case, all) of the query terms. This can be accomplished during the postings traversal; we only compute scores for documents containing all (or many) of the query terms. A danger of this scheme is that by requiring all (or even many) query terms to be present in a document before considering it for cosine computation, we may end up with fewer than candidate documents in the output. This issue will discussed further in Section 7.2.1 .

Intuitively, should be large compared with , especially if we use any form of the index elimination described in Section 7.1.2 . One issue here is that the value is set at the time of index construction, whereas is application dependent and may not be available until the query is received; as a result we may (as in the case of index elimination) find ourselves with a set that has fewer than documents. There is no reason to have the same value of for all terms in the dictionary; it could for instance be set to be higher for rarer terms.

   Static quality scores and ordering  static quality scores    static  21 The net score for a document is some combination of together with the query-dependent score induced (say) by (27). The precise combination may be determined by the learning methods of Section 6.1.2 , to be developed further in Section 15.4.1 ; but for the purposes of our exposition here, let us consider a simple sum: (35)   24 First, consider ordering the documents in the postings list for each term by decreasing value of . This allows us to perform the postings intersection algorithm of Figure 1.6 . In order to perform the intersection by a single pass through the postings of each query term, the algorithm of Figure 1.6 relied on the postings being ordered by document IDs. But in fact, we only required that all postings be ordered by a single common ordering; here we rely on the values to provide this common ordering. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2 , where the postings are ordered in decreasing order of .  A static quality-ordered index.In this example we assume that Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3 respectively have static quality scores . The first idea is a direct extension of champion lists: for a well-chosen value , we maintain for each term a global champion list of the documents with the highest values for . The list itself is, like all the postings lists considered so far, sorted by a common order (either by document IDs or by static quality). Then at query time, we only compute the net scores (35) for documents in the union of these global champion lists. Intuitively, this has the effect of focusing on documents likely to have large net scores. We conclude the discussion of global champion lists with one further idea. We maintain for each term two postings lists consisting of disjoint sets of documents, each sorted by values. The first list, which we call high, contains the documents with the highest tf values for . The second list, which we call low, contains all other documents containing . When processing a query, we first scan only the high lists of the query terms, computing net scores for any document on the high lists of all (or more than a certain number of) query terms. If we obtain scores for documents in the process, we terminate. If not, we continue the scanning into the low lists, scoring documents in these postings lists. This idea is developed further in Section 7.2.1 .

  <TEXT>
   Impact ordering 7.1.4 6.3.3  document-at-a-time  6.14  term-at-a-time The idea is to order the documents in the postings list of term by decreasing order of . Thus, the ordering of documents will vary from one postings list to another, and we cannot compute scores by a concurrent traversal of the postings lists of all query terms. Given postings lists ordered by decreasing order of , two ideas have been found to significantly lower the number of documents for which we accumulate scores: (1) when traversing the postings list for a query term , we stop after considering a prefix of the postings list - either after a fixed number of documents have been seen, or after the value of has dropped below a threshold; (2) when accumulating scores in the outer loop of Figure 6.14 , we consider the query terms in decreasing order of idf, so that the query terms likely to contribute the most to the final scores are considered first. This latter idea too can be adaptive at the time of processing a query: as we get to query terms with lower idf, we can determine whether to proceed based on the changes in document scores from processing the previous query term. If these changes are minimal, we may omit accumulation from the remaining query terms, or alternatively process shorter prefixes of their postings lists. These ideas form a common generalization of the methods introduced in Sections 7.1.2 -7.1.4 . We may also implement a version of static ordering in which each postings list is ordered by an additive combination of static and query-dependent scores. We would again lose the consistency of ordering across postings, thereby having to process query terms one at time accumulating scores for all documents as we go along. Depending on the particular scoring function, the postings list for a document may be ordered by other quantities than term frequency; under this more general setting, this idea is known as impact ordering.

  <TITLE>7.1.6 Cluster pruning</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Cluster pruning cluster pruning Pick documents at random from the collection. Call these leaders. For each document that is not a leader, we compute its nearest leader. followers   Given a query , find the leader that is closest to . This entails computing cosine similarities from to each of the leaders. The candidate set consists of together with its followers. We compute the cosine scores for all documents in this candidate set. The use of randomly chosen leaders for clustering is fast and likely to reflect the distribution of the document vectors in the vector space: a region of the vector space that is dense in documents is likely to produce multiple leaders and thus a finer partition into sub-regions. This illustrated in Figure 7.3 .  Figure 7.3: Cluster pruning. Variations of cluster pruning introduce additional parameters and , both of which are positive integers. In the pre-processing step we attach each follower to its closest leaders, rather than a single closest leader. At query time we consider the leaders closest to the query . Clearly, the basic scheme above corresponds to the case . Further, increasing or increases the likelihood of finding documents that are more likely to be in the set of true top-scoring documents, at the expense of more computation. We reiterate this approach when describing clustering in Chapter 16 (page 16.1 ). Exercises. We suggested above (Figure 7.2 ) that the postings for static quality ordering be in decreasing order of . Why do we use the decreasing rather than the increasing order? When discussing champion lists, we simply used the documents with the largest tf values to create the champion list for . But when considering global champion lists, we used idf as well, identifying documents with the largest values of . Why do we differentiate between these two cases? If we were to only have one-term queries, explain why the use of global champion lists with suffices for identifying the highest scoring documents. What is a simple modification to this idea if we were to only have -term queries for any fixed integer ? Explain how the common global ordering by values in all high and low lists helps make the score computation efficient. Consider again the data of Exercise 6.4.4 with nnn.atc for the query-dependent scoring. Suppose that we were given static quality scores of 1 for Doc1 and 2 for Doc2. Determine under Equation 35 what ranges of static quality score for Doc3 result in it being the first, second or third result for the query best car insurance. Sketch the frequency-ordered postings for the data in Figure 6.9 . Let the static quality scores for Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3 in Figure 6.11 be respectively 0.25, 0.5 and 1. Sketch the postings for impact ordering when each postings list is ordered by the sum of the static quality score and the Euclidean normalized tf values in Figure 6.11 . The nearest-neighbor problem in the plane is the following: given a set of data points on the plane, we preprocess them into some data structure such that, given a query point , we seek the point in that is closest to in Euclidean distance. Clearly cluster pruning can be used as an approach to the nearest-neighbor problem in the plane, if we wished to avoid computing the distance from to every one of the query points. Devise a simple example on the plane so that with two leaders, the answer returned by cluster pruning is incorrect (it is not the data point closest to ).

  <TITLE>7.2.2 Query-term proximity</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Query-term proximity Especially for free text queries on the web (Chapter 19 ), users prefer a document in which most or all of the query terms appear close to each other, because this is evidence that the document has text focused on their query intent. Consider a query with two or more query terms, . Let be the width of the smallest window in a document that contains all the query terms, measured in the number of words in the window. For instance, if the document were to simply consist of the sentence The quality of mercy is not strained, the smallest window for the query strained mercy would be 4. Intuitively, the smaller that is, the better that matches the query. In cases where the document does not contain all of the query terms, we can set to be some enormous number. We could also consider variants in which only words that are not stop words are considered in computing . Such proximity-weighted scoring functions are a departure from pure cosine similarity and closer to the ``soft conjunctive'' semantics that Google and other web search engines evidently use. How can we design such a proximity-weighted scoring function to depend on ? The simplest answer relies on a ``hand coding'' technique we introduce below in Section 7.2.3 . A more scalable approach goes back to Section 6.1.2 - we treat the integer as yet another feature in the scoring function, whose importance is assigned by machine learning, as will be developed further in Section 15.4.1 .

  <TITLE>7.2.3 Designing parsing and scoring functions</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Designing parsing and scoring functions  free text queries The answer of course depends on the user population, the query distribution and the collection of documents. Typically, a query parser is used to translate the user-specified keywords into a query with various operators that is executed against the underlying indexes. Sometimes, this execution can entail multiple queries against the underlying indexes; for example, the query parser may issue a stream of queries: Run the user-generated query string as a phrase query. Rank them by vector space scoring using as query the vector consisting of the 3 terms rising interest rates. If fewer than ten documents contain the phrase rising interest rates, run the two 2-term phrase queries rising interest and interest rates; rank these using vector space scoring, as well. If we still have fewer than ten results, run the vector space query consisting of the three individual query terms.  accumulates evidence The answer depends on the setting. In many enterprise settings we have application builders who make use of a toolkit of available scoring operators, along with a query parsing layer, with which to manually configure the scoring function as well as the query parser. Such application builders make use of the available zones, metadata and knowledge of typical documents and queries to tune the parsing and scoring. In collections whose characteristics change infrequently (in an enterprise application, significant changes in collection and query characteristics typically happen with infrequent events such as the introduction of new document formats or document management systems, or a merger with another company). Web search on the other hand is faced with a constantly changing document collection with new characteristics being introduced all the time. It is also a setting in which the number of scoring factors can run into the hundreds, making hand-tuned scoring a difficult exercise. To address this, it is becoming increasingly common to use machine-learned scoring, extending the ideas we introduced in Section 6.1.2 , as will be discussed further in Section 15.4.1 .

  <TEXT>
   Putting it all together 7.5  A complete search system.Data paths are shown primarily for a free text query. In this figure, documents stream in from the left for parsing and linguistic processing (language and format detection, tokenization and stemming). The resulting stream of tokens feeds into two modules. First, we retain a copy of each parsed document in a document cache. This will enable us to generate results snippets : snippets of text accompanying each document in the results list for a query. This snippet tries to give a succinct explanation to the user of why the document matches the query. The automatic generation of such snippets is the subject of Section 8.7 . A second copy of the tokens is fed to a bank of indexers that create a bank of indexes including zone and field indexes that store the metadata for each document, (tiered) positional indexes, indexes for spelling correction and other tolerant retrieval, and structures for accelerating inexact top- retrieval. A free text user query (top center) is sent down to the indexes both directly and through a module for generating spelling-correction candidates. As noted in Chapter 3 the latter may optionally be invoked only when the original query fails to retrieve enough results. Retrieved documents (dark arrow) are passed to a scoring module that computes scores based on machine-learned ranking (MLR), a technique that builds on Section 6.1.2 (to be further developed in Section 15.4.1 ) for scoring and ranking documents. Finally, these ranked documents are rendered as a results page. Exercises. Explain how the postings intersection algorithm first introduced in Section 1.3 can be adapted to find the smallest integer that contains all query terms. Adapt this procedure to work when not all query terms are present in a document.

  <TITLE>7.3 Vector space scoring and query operator interaction</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Vector space scoring and query operator interaction Vector space scoring supports so-called free text retrieval, in which a query is specified as a set of words without any query operators connecting them. It allows documents matching the query to be scored and thus ranked, unlike the Boolean, wildcard and phrase queries studied earlier. Classically, the interpretation of such free text queries was that at least one of the query terms be present in any retrieved document. However more recently, web search engines such as Google have popularized the notion that a set of terms typed into their query boxes (thus on the face of it, a free text query) carries the semantics of a conjunctive query that only retrieves documents containing all or most query terms.

  <TITLE>Chapter 8 Evaluation in information retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Evaluation in information retrieval We have seen in the preceding chapters many alternatives in designing an IR system. How do we know which of these techniques are effective in which applications? Should we use stop lists? Should we stem? Should we use inverse document frequency weighting? Information retrieval has developed as a highly empirical discipline, requiring careful and thorough evaluation to demonstrate the superior performance of novel techniques on representative document collections. In this chapter we begin with a discussion of measuring the effectiveness of IR systems (Section 8.1 ) and the test collections that are most often used for this purpose (Section 8.2 ). We then present the straightforward notion of relevant and nonrelevant documents and the formal evaluation methodology that has been developed for evaluating unranked retrieval results (Section 8.3 ). This includes explaining the kinds of evaluation measures that are standardly used for document retrieval and related tasks like text classification and why they are appropriate. We then extend these notions and develop further measures for evaluating ranked retrieval results (Section 8.4 ) and discuss developing reliable and informative test collections (Section 8.5 ). We then step back to introduce the notion of user utility, and how it is approximated by the use of document relevance (Section 8.6 ). The key utility measure is user happiness. Speed of response and the size of the index are factors in user happiness. It seems reasonable to assume that relevance of results is the most important factor: blindingly fast, useless answers do not make a user happy. However, user perceptions do not always coincide with system designers' notions of quality. For example, user happiness commonly depends very strongly on user interface design issues, including the layout, clarity, and responsiveness of the user interface, which are independent of the quality of the results returned. We touch on other measures of the quality of a system, in particular the generation of high-quality result summary snippets, which strongly influence user utility, but are not measured in the basic relevance ranking paradigm (Section 8.7 ).

   Information retrieval system evaluation To measure ad hoc information retrieval effectiveness in the standard way, we need a test collection consisting of three things: A document collection A test suite of information needs, expressible as queries A set of relevance judgments, standardly a binary assessment of either relevant or nonrelevant for each query-document pair.  relevant nonrelevant   gold standard  ground truth Relevance is assessed relative to an , not a query. For example, an information need might be: Information on whether drinking red wine is more effective at reducing your risk of heart attacks than white wine. wine and red and white and heart and attack and effective 8.5.1 Many systems contain various weights (often known as parameters) that can be adjusted to tune system performance. It is wrong to report results on a test collection which were obtained by tuning these parameters to maximize performance on that collection. That is because such tuning overstates the expected performance of the system, because the weights will be set to maximize performance on one particular set of queries rather than for a random sample of queries. In such cases, the correct procedure is to have one or more development test collections , and to tune the parameters on the development test collection. The tester then runs the system with those weights on the test collection and reports the results on that collection as an unbiased estimate of performance.

  <TITLE>8.2 Standard test collections</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Standard test collections Here is a list of the most standard test collections and evaluation series. We focus particularly on test collections for ad hoc information retrieval system evaluation, but also mention a couple of similar test collections for text classification. The Cranfield collection. This was the pioneering test collection in allowing precise quantitative measures of information retrieval effectiveness, but is nowadays too small for anything but the most elementary pilot experiments. Collected in the United Kingdom starting in the late 1950s, it contains 1398 abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of 225 queries, and exhaustive relevance judgments of all (query, document) pairs. Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) . The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has run a large IR test bed evaluation series since 1992. Within this framework, there have been many tracks over a range of different test collections, but the best known test collections are the ones used for the TREC Ad Hoc track during the first 8 TREC evaluations between 1992 and 1999. In total, these test collections comprise 6 CDs containing 1.89 million documents (mainly, but not exclusively, newswire articles) and relevance judgments for 450 information needs, which are called topics and specified in detailed text passages. Individual test collections are defined over different subsets of this data. The early TRECs each consisted of 50 information needs, evaluated over different but overlapping sets of documents. TRECs 6-8 provide 150 information needs over about 528,000 newswire and Foreign Broadcast Information Service articles. This is probably the best subcollection to use in future work, because it is the largest and the topics are more consistent. Because the test document collections are so large, there are no exhaustive relevance judgments. Rather, NIST assessors' relevance judgments are available only for the documents that were among the top returned for some system which was entered in the TREC evaluation for which the information need was developed. In more recent years, NIST has done evaluations on larger document collections, including the 25 million page GOV2 web page collection. From the beginning, the NIST test document collections were orders of magnitude larger than anything available to researchers previously and GOV2 is now the largest Web collection easily available for research purposes. Nevertheless, the size of GOV2 is still more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the current size of the document collections indexed by the large web search companies. NII Test Collections for IR Systems ( NTCIR ). The NTCIR project has built various test collections of similar sizes to the TREC collections, focusing on East Asian language and cross-language information retrieval , where queries are made in one language over a document collection containing documents in one or more other languages. See: http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/data/data-en.html Cross Language Evaluation Forum ( CLEF ). This evaluation series has concentrated on European languages and cross-language information retrieval. See: http://www.clef-campaign.org/ and Reuters-RCV1. For text classification, the most used test collection has been the Reuters-21578 collection of 21578 newswire articles; see Chapter 13 , page 13.6 . More recently, Reuters released the much larger Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1), consisting of 806,791 documents; see Chapter 4 , page 4.2 . Its scale and rich annotation makes it a better basis for future research. 20 Newsgroups . This is another widely used text classification collection, collected by Ken Lang. It consists of 1000 articles from each of 20 Usenet newsgroups (the newsgroup name being regarded as the category). After the removal of duplicate articles, as it is usually used, it contains 18941 articles.

  <TITLE>8.3 Evaluation of unranked retrieval sets</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Evaluation of unranked retrieval sets Given these ingredients, how is system effectiveness measured? The two most frequent and basic measures for information retrieval effectiveness are precision and recall. These are first defined for the simple case where an IR system returns a set of documents for a query. We will see later how to extend these notions to ranked retrieval situations. Precision ( ) is the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant (36) Recall ( ) is the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved (37)     (38) (39)   An obvious alternative that may occur to the reader is to judge an information retrieval system by its accuracy , that is, the fraction of its classifications that are correct. In terms of the contingency table above, . This seems plausible, since there are two actual classes, relevant and nonrelevant, and an information retrieval system can be thought of as a two-class classifier which attempts to label them as such (it retrieves the subset of documents which it believes to be relevant). This is precisely the effectiveness measure often used for evaluating machine learning classification problems. There is a good reason why accuracy is not an appropriate measure for information retrieval problems. In almost all circumstances, the data is extremely skewed: normally over 99.9% of the documents are in the nonrelevant category. A system tuned to maximize accuracy can appear to perform well by simply deeming all documents nonrelevant to all queries. Even if the system is quite good, trying to label some documents as relevant will almost always lead to a high rate of false positives. However, labeling all documents as nonrelevant is completely unsatisfying to an information retrieval system user. Users are always going to want to see some documents, and can be assumed to have a certain tolerance for seeing some false positives providing that they get some useful information. The measures of precision and recall concentrate the evaluation on the return of true positives, asking what percentage of the relevant documents have been found and how many false positives have also been returned. The advantage of having the two numbers for precision and recall is that one is more important than the other in many circumstances. Typical web surfers would like every result on the first page to be relevant (high precision) but have not the slightest interest in knowing let alone looking at every document that is relevant. In contrast, various professional searchers such as paralegals and intelligence analysts are very concerned with trying to get as high recall as possible, and will tolerate fairly low precision results in order to get it. Individuals searching their hard disks are also often interested in high recall searches. Nevertheless, the two quantities clearly trade off against one another: you can always get a recall of 1 (but very low precision) by retrieving all documents for all queries! Recall is a non-decreasing function of the number of documents retrieved. On the other hand, in a good system, precision usually decreases as the number of documents retrieved is increased. In general we want to get some amount of recall while tolerating only a certain percentage of false positives. A single measure that trades off precision versus recall is the F measure , which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall: (40)     balanced F measure        (41)       Graph comparing the harmonic mean to other means.The graph shows a slice through the calculation of various means of precision and recall for the fixed recall value of 70%. The harmonic mean is always less than either the arithmetic or geometric mean, and often quite close to the minimum of the two numbers. When the precision is also 70%, all the measures coincide. Why do we use a harmonic mean rather than the simpler average (arithmetic mean)? Recall that we can always get 100% recall by just returning all documents, and therefore we can always get a 50% arithmetic mean by the same process. This strongly suggests that the arithmetic mean is an unsuitable measure to use. In contrast, if we assume that 1 document in 10,000 is relevant to the query, the harmonic mean score of this strategy is 0.02%. The harmonic mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean. When the values of two numbers differ greatly, the harmonic mean is closer to their minimum than to their arithmetic mean; see Figure 8.1 . Exercises.

  <TITLE>8.4 Evaluation of ranked retrieval results</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Evaluation of ranked retrieval results  Figure 8.2: Precision/recall graph. Precision, recall, and the F measure are set-based measures. They are computed using unordered sets of documents. We need to extend these measures (or to define new measures) if we are to evaluate the ranked retrieval results that are now standard with search engines. In a ranked retrieval context, appropriate sets of retrieved documents are naturally given by the top retrieved documents. For each such set, precision and recall values can be plotted to give a precision-recall curve , such as the one shown in Figure 8.2 . Precision-recall curves have a distinctive saw-tooth shape: if the document retrieved is nonrelevant then recall is the same as for the top documents, but precision has dropped. If it is relevant, then both precision and recall increase, and the curve jags up and to the right. It is often useful to remove these jiggles and the standard way to do this is with an interpolated precision: the interpolated precision at a certain recall level is defined as the highest precision found for any recall level : (42)  The justification is that almost anyone would be prepared to look at a few more documents if it would increase the percentage of the viewed set that were relevant (that is, if the precision of the larger set is higher). Interpolated precision is shown by a thinner line in Figure 8.2 . With this definition, the interpolated precision at a recall of 0 is well-defined (Exercise 8.4 ).   Recall Interp.   Precision 0.0 1.00 0.1 0.67 0.2 0.63 0.3 0.55 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.41 0.6 0.36 0.7 0.29 0.8 0.13 0.9 0.10 1.0 0.08 Calculation of 11-point Interpolated Average Precision.This is for the precision-recall curve shown in Figure 8.2 .  Examining the entire precision-recall curve is very informative, but there is often a desire to boil this information down to a few numbers, or perhaps even a single number. The traditional way of doing this (used for instance in the first 8 TREC Ad Hoc evaluations) is the 11-point interpolated average precision . For each information need, the interpolated precision is measured at the 11 recall levels of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0. For the precision-recall curve in Figure 8.2 , these 11 values are shown in Table 8.1 . For each recall level, we then calculate the arithmetic mean of the interpolated precision at that recall level for each information need in the test collection. A composite precision-recall curve showing 11 points can then be graphed. Figure 8.3 shows an example graph of such results from a representative good system at TREC 8.  Averaged 11-point precision/recall graph across 50 queries for a representative TREC system.The Mean Average Precision for this system is 0.2553. In recent years, other measures have become more common. Most standard among the TREC community is Mean Average Precision (MAP), which provides a single-figure measure of quality across recall levels. Among evaluation measures, MAP has been shown to have especially good discrimination and stability. For a single information need, Average Precision is the average of the precision value obtained for the set of top documents existing after each relevant document is retrieved, and this value is then averaged over information needs. That is, if the set of relevant documents for an information need is and is the set of ranked retrieval results from the top result until you get to document , then (43)   Using MAP, fixed recall levels are not chosen, and there is no interpolation. The MAP value for a test collection is the arithmetic mean of average precision values for individual information needs. (This has the effect of weighting each information need equally in the final reported number, even if many documents are relevant to some queries whereas very few are relevant to other queries.) Calculated MAP scores normally vary widely across information needs when measured within a single system, for instance, between 0.1 and 0.7. Indeed, there is normally more agreement in MAP for an individual information need across systems than for MAP scores for different information needs for the same system. This means that a set of test information needs must be large and diverse enough to be representative of system effectiveness across different queries. The above measures factor in precision at all recall levels. For many prominent applications, particularly web search, this may not be germane to users. What matters is rather how many good results there are on the first page or the first three pages. This leads to measuring precision at fixed low levels of retrieved results, such as 10 or 30 documents. This is referred to as ``Precision at '', for example ``Precision at 10''. It has the advantage of not requiring any estimate of the size of the set of relevant documents but the disadvantages that it is the least stable of the commonly used evaluation measures and that it does not average well, since the total number of relevant documents for a query has a strong influence on precision at . An alternative, which alleviates this problem, is R-precision . It requires having a set of known relevant documents , from which we calculate the precision of the top documents returned. (The set may be incomplete, such as when is formed by creating relevance judgments for the pooled top results of particular systems in a set of experiments.) R-precision adjusts for the size of the set of relevant documents: A perfect system could score 1 on this metric for each query, whereas, even a perfect system could only achieve a precision at 20 of 0.4 if there were only 8 documents in the collection relevant to an information need. Averaging this measure across queries thus makes more sense. This measure is harder to explain to naive users than Precision at but easier to explain than MAP. If there are relevant documents for a query, we examine the top results of a system, and find that are relevant, then by definition, not only is the precision (and hence R-precision) , but the recall of this result set is also . Thus, R-precision turns out to be identical to the break-even point , another measure which is sometimes used, defined in terms of this equality relationship holding. Like Precision at , R-precision describes only one point on the precision-recall curve, rather than attempting to summarize effectiveness across the curve, and it is somewhat unclear why you should be interested in the break-even point rather than either the best point on the curve (the point with maximal F-measure) or a retrieval level of interest to a particular application (Precision at ). Nevertheless, R-precision turns out to be highly correlated with MAP empirically, despite measuring only a single point on the curve.  Figure 8.4: The ROC curve corresponding to the precision-recall curve in Figure 8.2 . . Another concept sometimes used in evaluation is an ROC curve . (``ROC'' stands for ``Receiver Operating Characteristics'', but knowing that doesn't help most people.) An ROC curve plots the true positive rate or sensitivity against the false positive rate or ( ). Here, sensitivity is just another term for recall. The false positive rate is given by . Figure 8.4 shows the ROC curve corresponding to the precision-recall curve in Figure 8.2 . An ROC curve always goes from the bottom left to the top right of the graph. For a good system, the graph climbs steeply on the left side. For unranked result sets, specificity , given by , was not seen as a very useful notion. Because the set of true negatives is always so large, its value would be almost 1 for all information needs (and, correspondingly, the value of the false positive rate would be almost 0). That is, the ``interesting'' part of Figure 8.2 is , a part which is compressed to a small corner of Figure 8.4 . But an ROC curve could make sense when looking over the full retrieval spectrum, and it provides another way of looking at the data. In many fields, a common aggregate measure is to report the area under the ROC curve, which is the ROC analog of MAP. Precision-recall curves are sometimes loosely referred to as ROC curves. This is understandable, but not accurate. A final approach that has seen increasing adoption, especially when employed with machine learning approaches to ranking svm-ranking is measures of cumulative gain , and in particular normalized discounted cumulative gain ( NDCG ). NDCG is designed for situations of non-binary notions of relevance (cf. Section 8.5.1 ). Like precision at , it is evaluated over some number of top search results. For a set of queries , let be the relevance score assessors gave to document for query . Then, (44)       Exercises. What are the possible values for interpolated precision at a recall level of 0? Must there always be a break-even point between precision and recall? Either show there must be or give a counter-example. What is the relationship between the value of and the break-even point? The Dice coefficient of two sets is a measure of their intersection scaled by their size (giving a value in the range 0 to 1): (45) Show that the balanced F-measure () is equal to the Dice coefficient of the retrieved and relevant document sets. Consider an information need for which there are 4 relevant documents in the collection. Contrast two systems run on this collection. Their top 10 results are judged for relevance as follows (the leftmost item is the top ranked search result): System 1   R N R N N   N N N R R System 2   N R N N R   R R N N N What is the MAP of each system? Which has a higher MAP? Does this result intuitively make sense? What does it say about what is important in getting a good MAP score? What is the R-precision of each system? (Does it rank the systems the same as MAP?) The following list of Rs and Ns represents relevant (R) and nonrelevant (N) returned documents in a ranked list of 20 documents retrieved in response to a query from a collection of 10,000 documents. The top of the ranked list (the document the system thinks is most likely to be relevant) is on the left of the list. This list shows 6 relevant documents. Assume that there are 8 relevant documents in total in the collection. R R N N N   N N N R N   R N N N R   N N N N R What is the precision of the system on the top 20? What is the F on the top 20?

What is the MAP for the query? Assume, now, instead, that the system returned the entire 10,000 documents in a ranked list, and these are the first 20 results returned. f. What is the largest possible MAP that this system could have? g. What is the smallest possible MAP that this system could have? h. In a set of experiments, only the top 20 results are evaluated by hand. The result in (e) is used to approximate the range (f)-(g). For this example, how large (in absolute terms) can the error for the MAP be by calculating (e) instead of (f) and (g) for this query?

  <TITLE>8.5 Assessing relevance</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Assessing relevance To properly evaluate a system, your test information needs must be germane to the documents in the test document collection, and appropriate for predicted usage of the system. These information needs are best designed by domain experts. Using random combinations of query terms as an information need is generally not a good idea because typically they will not resemble the actual distribution of information needs. Given information needs and documents, you need to collect relevance assessments. This is a time-consuming and expensive process involving human beings. For tiny collections like Cranfield, exhaustive judgments of relevance for each query and document pair were obtained. For large modern collections, it is usual for relevance to be assessed only for a subset of the documents for each query. The most standard approach is pooling , where relevance is assessed over a subset of the collection that is formed from the top documents returned by a number of different IR systems (usually the ones to be evaluated), and perhaps other sources such as the results of Boolean keyword searches or documents found by expert searchers in an interactive process.   Table 8.2: Calculating the kappa statistic.     Judge 2 Relevance     Yes   No Total Judge 1 Yes 300   20 320 Relevance No 10   70 80   Total 310   90 400 Observed proportion of the times the judges agreed Pooled marginals Probability that the two judges agreed by chance Kappa statistic   A human is not a device that reliably reports a gold standard judgment of relevance of a document to a query. Rather, humans and their relevance judgments are quite idiosyncratic and variable. But this is not a problem to be solved: in the final analysis, the success of an IR system depends on how good it is at satisfying the needs of these idiosyncratic humans, one information need at a time. Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider and measure how much agreement between judges there is on relevance judgments. In the social sciences, a common measure for agreement between judges is the kappa statistic . It is designed for categorical judgments and corrects a simple agreement rate for the rate of chance agreement. (46)      marginal  8.2 Interjudge agreement of relevance has been measured within the TREC evaluations and for medical IR collections. Using the above rules of thumb, the level of agreement normally falls in the range of ``fair'' (0.67-0.8). The fact that human agreement on a binary relevance judgment is quite modest is one reason for not requiring more fine-grained relevance labeling from the test set creator. To answer the question of whether IR evaluation results are valid despite the variation of individual assessors' judgments, people have experimented with evaluations taking one or the other of two judges' opinions as the gold standard. The choice can make a considerable absolute difference to reported scores, but has in general been found to have little impact on the relative effectiveness ranking of either different systems or variants of a single system which are being compared for effectiveness.

  <TITLE>8.5.1 Critiques and justifications of the concept of relevance</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Critiques and justifications of the concept of relevance The advantage of system evaluation, as enabled by the standard model of relevant and nonrelevant documents, is that we have a fixed setting in which we can vary IR systems and system parameters to carry out comparative experiments. Such formal testing is much less expensive and allows clearer diagnosis of the effect of changing system parameters than doing user studies of retrieval effectiveness. Indeed, once we have a formal measure that we have confidence in, we can proceed to optimize effectiveness by machine learning methods, rather than tuning parameters by hand. Of course, if the formal measure poorly describes what users actually want, doing this will not be effective in improving user satisfaction. Our perspective is that, in practice, the standard formal measures for IR evaluation, although a simplification, are good enough, and recent work in optimizing formal evaluation measures in IR has succeeded brilliantly. There are numerous examples of techniques developed in formal evaluation settings, which improve effectiveness in operational settings, such as the development of document length normalization methods within the context of TREC ( and 11.4.3 ) and machine learning methods for adjusting parameter weights in scoring (Section 6.1.2 ). That is not to say that there are not problems latent within the abstractions used. The relevance of one document is treated as independent of the relevance of other documents in the collection. (This assumption is actually built into most retrieval systems - documents are scored against queries, not against each other - as well as being assumed in the evaluation methods.) Assessments are binary: there aren't any nuanced assessments of relevance. Relevance of a document to an information need is treated as an absolute, objective decision. But judgments of relevance are subjective, varying across people, as we discussed above. In practice, human assessors are also imperfect measuring instruments, susceptible to failures of understanding and attention. We also have to assume that users' information needs do not change as they start looking at retrieval results. Any results based on one collection are heavily skewed by the choice of collection, queries, and relevance judgment set: the results may not translate from one domain to another or to a different user population. Some of these problems may be fixable. A number of recent evaluations, including INEX, some TREC tracks, and NTCIR have adopted an ordinal notion of relevance with documents divided into 3 or 4 classes, distinguishing slightly relevant documents from highly relevant documents. See Section 10.4 (page ) for a detailed discussion of how this is implemented in the INEX evaluations. One clear problem with the relevance-based assessment that we have presented is the distinction between relevance and marginal relevance : whether a document still has distinctive usefulness after the user has looked at certain other documents (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). Even if a document is highly relevant, its information can be completely redundant with other documents which have already been examined. The most extreme case of this is documents that are duplicates - a phenomenon that is actually very common on the World Wide Web - but it can also easily occur when several documents provide a similar precis of an event. In such circumstances, marginal relevance is clearly a better measure of utility to the user. Maximizing marginal relevance requires returning documents that exhibit diversity and novelty. One way to approach measuring this is by using distinct facts or entities as evaluation units. This perhaps more directly measures true utility to the user but doing this makes it harder to create a test collection. Exercises. Below is a table showing how two human judges rated the relevance of a set of 12 documents to a particular information need (0 = nonrelevant, 1 = relevant). Let us assume that you've written an IR system that for this query returns the set of documents {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. docID Judge 1 Judge 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 1 1 4 1 1 5 1 0 6 1 0 7 1 0 8 1 0 9 0 1 10 0 1 11 0 1 12 0 1 Calculate the kappa measure between the two judges. Calculate precision, recall, and of your system if a document is considered relevant only if the two judges agree. Calculate precision, recall, and of your system if a document is considered relevant if either judge thinks it is relevant.

   A broader perspective: System quality and user utility Formal evaluation measures are at some distance from our ultimate interest in measures of human utility: how satisfied is each user with the results the system gives for each information need that they pose? The standard way to measure human satisfaction is by various kinds of user studies. These might include quantitative measures, both objective, such as time to complete a task, as well as subjective, such as a score for satisfaction with the search engine, and qualitative measures, such as user comments on the search interface. In this section we will touch on other system aspects that allow quantitative evaluation and the issue of user utility.   Subsections System issues User utility Refining a deployed system

Chapter 4 ) How fast does it search, that is, what is its latency as a function of index size? How expressive is its query language? How fast is it on complex queries?

  <TITLE>8.6.2 User utility</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   User utility What we would really like is a way of quantifying aggregate user happiness, based on the relevance, speed, and user interface of a system. One part of this is understanding the distribution of people we wish to make happy, and this depends entirely on the setting. For a web search engine, happy search users are those who find what they want. One indirect measure of such users is that they tend to return to the same engine. Measuring the rate of return of users is thus an effective metric, which would of course be more effective if you could also measure how much these users used other search engines. But advertisers are also users of modern web search engines. They are happy if customers click through to their sites and then make purchases. On an eCommerce web site, a user is likely to be wanting to purchase something. Thus, we can measure the time to purchase, or the fraction of searchers who become buyers. On a shopfront web site, perhaps both the user's and the store owner's needs are satisfied if a purchase is made. Nevertheless, in general, we need to decide whether it is the end user's or the eCommerce site owner's happiness that we are trying to optimize. Usually, it is the store owner who is paying us. For an ``enterprise'' (company, government, or academic) intranet search engine, the relevant metric is more likely to be user productivity: how much time do users spend looking for information that they need. There are also many other practical criteria concerning such matters as information security, which we mentioned in Section 4.6 (page ). User happiness is elusive to measure, and this is part of why the standard methodology uses the proxy of relevance of search results. The standard direct way to get at user satisfaction is to run user studies, where people engage in tasks, and usually various metrics are measured, the participants are observed, and ethnographic interview techniques are used to get qualitative information on satisfaction. User studies are very useful in system design, but they are time consuming and expensive to do. They are also difficult to do well, and expertise is required to design the studies and to interpret the results. We will not discuss the details of human usability testing here.

  <TITLE>8.6.3 Refining a deployed system</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Refining a deployed system If an IR system has been built and is being used by a large number of users, the system's builders can evaluate possible changes by deploying variant versions of the system and recording measures that are indicative of user satisfaction with one variant vs. others as they are being used. This method is frequently used by web search engines. The most common version of this is A/B testing , a term borrowed from the advertising industry. For such a test, precisely one thing is changed between the current system and a proposed system, and a small proportion of traffic (say, 1-10% of users) is randomly directed to the variant system, while most users use the current system. For example, if we wish to investigate a change to the ranking algorithm, we redirect a random sample of users to a variant system and evaluate measures such as the frequency with which people click on the top result, or any result on the first page. (This particular analysis method is referred to as clickthrough log analysis or clickstream mining . It is further discussed as a method of implicit feedback in Section 9.1.7 (page ).) The basis of A/B testing is running a bunch of single variable tests (either in sequence or in parallel): for each test only one parameter is varied from the control (the current live system). It is therefore easy to see whether varying each parameter has a positive or negative effect. Such testing of a live system can easily and cheaply gauge the effect of a change on users, and, with a large enough user base, it is practical to measure even very small positive and negative effects. In principle, more analytic power can be achieved by varying multiple things at once in an uncorrelated (random) way, and doing standard multivariate statistical analysis, such as multiple linear regression. In practice, though, A/B testing is widely used, because A/B tests are easy to deploy, easy to understand, and easy to explain to management.

  <TITLE>8.7 Results snippets</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Results snippets Having chosen or ranked the documents matching a query, we wish to present a results list that will be informative to the user. In many cases the user will not want to examine all the returned documents and so we want to make the results list informative enough that the user can do a final ranking of the documents for themselves based on relevance to their information need.The standard way of doing this is to provide a snippet , a short summary of the document, which is designed so as to allow the user to decide its relevance. Typically, the snippet consists of the document title and a short summary, which is automatically extracted. The question is how to design the summary so as to maximize its usefulness to the user. The two basic kinds of summaries are static , which are always the same regardless of the query, and dynamic (or query-dependent), which are customized according to the user's information need as deduced from a query. Dynamic summaries attempt to explain why a particular document was retrieved for the query at hand. A static summary is generally comprised of either or both a subset of the document and metadata associated with the document. The simplest form of summary takes the first two sentences or 50 words of a document, or extracts particular zones of a document, such as the title and author. Instead of zones of a document, the summary can instead use metadata associated with the document. This may be an alternative way to provide an author or date, or may include elements which are designed to give a summary, such as the description metadata which can appear in the meta element of a web HTML page. This summary is typically extracted and cached at indexing time, in such a way that it can be retrieved and presented quickly when displaying search results, whereas having to access the actual document content might be a relatively expensive operation. There has been extensive work within natural language processing (NLP) on better ways to do text summarization . Most such work still aims only to choose sentences from the original document to present and concentrates on how to select good sentences. The models typically combine positional factors, favoring the first and last paragraphs of documents and the first and last sentences of paragraphs, with content factors, emphasizing sentences with key terms, which have low document frequency in the collection as a whole, but high frequency and good distribution across the particular document being returned. In sophisticated NLP approaches, the system synthesizes sentences for a summary, either by doing full text generation or by editing and perhaps combining sentences used in the document. For example, it might delete a relative clause or replace a pronoun with the noun phrase that it refers to. This last class of methods remains in the realm of research and is seldom used for search results: it is easier, safer, and often even better to just use sentences from the original document. Dynamic summaries display one or more ``windows'' on the document, aiming to present the pieces that have the most utility to the user in evaluating the document with respect to their information need. Usually these windows contain one or several of the query terms, and so are often referred to as keyword-in-context ( ) snippets, though sometimes they may still be pieces of the text such as the title that are selected for their query-independent information value just as in the case of static summarization. Dynamic summaries are generated in conjunction with scoring. If the query is found as a phrase, occurrences of the phrase in the document will be shown as the summary. If not, windows within the document that contain multiple query terms will be selected. Commonly these windows may just stretch some number of words to the left and right of the query terms. This is a place where NLP techniques can usefully be employed: users prefer snippets that read well because they contain complete phrases.   Dynamic summaries are generally regarded as greatly improving the usability of IR systems, but they present a complication for IR system design. A dynamic summary cannot be precomputed, but, on the other hand, if a system has only a positional index, then it cannot easily reconstruct the context surrounding search engine hits in order to generate such a dynamic summary. This is one reason for using static summaries. The standard solution to this in a world of large and cheap disk drives is to locally cache all the documents at index time (notwithstanding that this approach raises various legal, information security and control issues that are far from resolved) as shown in Figure 7.5 (page ). Then, a system can simply scan a document which is about to appear in a displayed results list to find snippets containing the query words. Beyond simply access to the text, producing a good KWIC snippet requires some care. Given a variety of keyword occurrences in a document, the goal is to choose fragments which are: (i) maximally informative about the discussion of those terms in the document, (ii) self-contained enough to be easy to read, and (iii) short enough to fit within the normally strict constraints on the space available for summaries. Generating snippets must be fast since the system is typically generating many snippets for each query that it handles. Rather than caching an entire document, it is common to cache only a generous but fixed size prefix of the document, such as perhaps 10,000 characters. For most common, short documents, the entire document is thus cached, but huge amounts of local storage will not be wasted on potentially vast documents. Summaries of documents whose length exceeds the prefix size will be based on material in the prefix only, which is in general a useful zone in which to look for a document summary anyway. If a document has been updated since it was last processed by a crawler and indexer, these changes will be neither in the cache nor in the index. In these circumstances, neither the index nor the summary will accurately reflect the current contents of the document, but it is the differences between the summary and the actual document content that will be more glaringly obvious to the end user.

  <TITLE>8.8 References and further reading</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   References and further reading Definition and implementation of the notion of relevance to a query got off to a rocky start in 1953. Swanson (1988) reports that in an evaluation in that year between two teams, they agreed that 1390 documents were variously relevant to a set of 98 questions, but disagreed on a further 1577 documents, and the disagreements were never resolved. Rigorous formal testing of IR systems was first completed in the Cranfield experiments, beginning in the late 1950s. A retrospective discussion of the Cranfield test collection and experimentation with it can be found in (Cleverdon, 1991). The other seminal series of early IR experiments were those on the SMART system by Gerard Salton and colleagues (Salton, 1971b;1991). The TREC evaluations are described in detail by Voorhees and Harman (2005). Online information is available at http://trec.nist.gov/. Initially, few researchers computed the statistical significance of their experimental results, but the IR community increasingly demands this (Hull, 1993). User studies of IR system effectiveness began more recently (Saracevic and Kantor, 1988;1996). The notions of recall and precision were first used by Kent et al. (1955), although the term precision did not appear until later. The (or, rather its complement ) was introduced by van Rijsbergen (1979). He provides an extensive theoretical discussion, which shows how adopting a principle of decreasing marginal relevance (at some point a user will be unwilling to sacrifice a unit of precision for an added unit of recall) leads to the harmonic mean being the appropriate method for combining precision and recall (and hence to its adoption rather than the minimum or geometric mean). Buckley and Voorhees (2000) compare several evaluation measures, including precision at , MAP, and R-precision, and evaluate the error rate of each measure. was adopted as the official evaluation metric in the TREC HARD track (Allan, 2005). Aslam and Yilmaz (2005) examine its surprisingly close correlation to MAP, which had been noted in earlier studies (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000, Tague-Sutcliffe and Blustein, 1995). A standard program for evaluating IR systems which computes many measures of ranked retrieval effectiveness is Chris Buckley's trec_eval program used in the TREC evaluations. It can be downloaded from: http://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/. Kekäläinen and Järvelin (2002) argue for the superiority of graded relevance judgments when dealing with very large document collections, and Järvelin and Kekäläinen (2002) introduce cumulated gain-based methods for IR system evaluation in this context. Sakai (2007) does a study of the stability and sensitivity of evaluation measures based on graded relevance judgments from NTCIR tasks, and concludes that NDCG is best for evaluating document ranking. Schamber et al. (1990) examine the concept of relevance, stressing its multidimensional and context-specific nature, but also arguing that it can be measured effectively. (Voorhees, 2000) is the standard article for examining variation in relevance judgments and their effects on retrieval system scores and ranking for the TREC Ad Hoc task. Voorhees concludes that although the numbers change, the rankings are quite stable. Hersh et al. (1994) present similar analysis for a medical IR collection. In contrast, Kekäläinen (2005) analyze some of the later TRECs, exploring a 4-way relevance judgment and the notion of cumulative gain, arguing that the relevance measure used does substantially affect system rankings. See also Harter (1998). Zobel (1998) studies whether the pooling method used by TREC to collect a subset of documents that will be evaluated for relevance is reliable and fair, and concludes that it is. The and its use for language-related purposes is discussed by Carletta (1996). Many standard sources (e.g., Siegel and Castellan, 1988) present pooled calculation of the expected agreement, but Di Eugenio (2004) argue for preferring the unpooled agreement (though perhaps presenting multiple measures). For further discussion of alternative measures of agreement, which may in fact be better, see Lombard et al. (2002) and Krippendorff (2003). Text summarization has been actively explored for many years. Modern work on sentence selection was initiated by Kupiec et al. (1995). More recent work includes (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) and (Jing, 2000), together with a broad selection of work appearing at the yearly DUC conferences and at other NLP venues. Tombros and Sanderson (1998) demonstrate the advantages of dynamic summaries in the IR context. Turpin et al. (2007) address how to generate snippets efficiently. Clickthrough log analysis is studied in (Joachims, 2002b, Joachims et al., 2005). In a series of papers, Hersh, Turpin and colleagues show how improvements in formal retrieval effectiveness, as evaluated in batch experiments, do not always translate into an improved system for users (Hersh et al., 2000b, Turpin and Hersh, 2002, Hersh et al., 2000a;2001, Turpin and Hersh, 2001). User interfaces for IR and human factors such as models of human information seeking and usability testing are outside the scope of what we cover in this book. More information on these topics can be found in other textbooks, including (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, ch. 10) and (Korfhage, 1997), and collections focused on cognitive aspects (Spink and Cole, 2005).

  <TITLE>Chapter 9 Relevance feedback and query expansion</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Relevance feedback and query expansion In most collections, the same concept may be referred to using different words. This issue, known as synonymy , has an impact on the recall of most information retrieval systems. For example, you would want a search for aircraft to match plane (but only for references to an airplane, not a woodworking plane), and for a search on thermodynamics to match references to heat in appropriate discussions. Users often attempt to address this problem themselves by manually refining a query, as was discussed in Section 1.4 ; in this chapter we discuss ways in which a system can help with query refinement, either fully automatically or with the user in the loop. The methods for tackling this problem split into two major classes: global methods and local methods. Global methods are techniques for expanding or reformulating query terms independent of the query and results returned from it, so that changes in the query wording will cause the new query to match other semantically similar terms. Global methods include: Query expansion/reformulation with a thesaurus or WordNet (Section 9.2.2 ) Query expansion via automatic thesaurus generation (Section 9.2.3 ) Techniques like spelling correction (discussed in Chapter 3 ) Relevance feedback (Section 9.1 ) Pseudo relevance feedback, also known as Blind relevance feedback (Section 9.1.6 ) (Global) indirect relevance feedback (Section 9.1.7 )   Subsections Relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback The Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback The underlying theory.

  <TITLE>9.1 Relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback The idea of relevance feedback ( ) is to involve the user in the retrieval process so as to improve the final result set. In particular, the user gives feedback on the relevance of documents in an initial set of results. The basic procedure is: The user issues a (short, simple) query. The system returns an initial set of retrieval results. The user marks some returned documents as relevant or nonrelevant. The system computes a better representation of the information need based on the user feedback. The system displays a revised set of retrieval results.  (a) (b) Relevance feedback searching over images.(a) The user views the initial query results for a query of bike, selects the first, third and fourth result in the top row and the fourth result in the bottom row as relevant, and submits this feedback. (b) The users sees the revised result set. Precision is greatly improved. From http://nayana.ece.ucsb.edu/imsearch/imsearch.html(Newsam et al., 2001). Image search provides a good example of relevance feedback. Not only is it easy to see the results at work, but this is a domain where a user can easily have difficulty formulating what they want in words, but can easily indicate relevant or nonrelevant images.

  <TITLE>9.1.3 When does relevance feedback work?</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   When does relevance feedback work? The success of relevance feedback depends on certain assumptions. Firstly, the user has to have sufficient knowledge to be able to make an initial query which is at least somewhere close to the documents they desire. This is needed anyhow for successful information retrieval in the basic case, but it is important to see the kinds of problems that relevance feedback cannot solve alone. Cases where relevance feedback alone is not sufficient include: Misspellings. If the user spells a term in a different way to the way it is spelled in any document in the collection, then relevance feedback is unlikely to be effective. This can be addressed by the spelling correction techniques of Chapter 3 . Cross-language information retrieval. Documents in another language are not nearby in a vector space based on term distribution. Rather, documents in the same language cluster more closely together. Mismatch of searcher's vocabulary versus collection vocabulary. If the user searches for laptop but all the documents use the term notebook computer, then the query will fail, and relevance feedback is again most likely ineffective.  Secondly, the relevance feedback approach requires relevant documents to be similar to each other. That is, they should cluster. Ideally, the term distribution in all relevant documents will be similar to that in the documents marked by the users, while the term distribution in all nonrelevant documents will be different from those in relevant documents. Things will work well if all relevant documents are tightly clustered around a single prototype, or, at least, if there are different prototypes, if the relevant documents have significant vocabulary overlap, while similarities between relevant and nonrelevant documents are small. Implicitly, the Rocchio relevance feedback model treats relevant documents as a single cluster, which it models via the centroid of the cluster. This approach does not work as well if the relevant documents are a multimodal class, that is, they consist of several clusters of documents within the vector space. This can happen with: Subsets of the documents using different vocabulary, such as Burma vs. Myanmar A query for which the answer set is inherently disjunctive, such as Pop stars who once worked at Burger King. Instances of a general concept, which often appear as a disjunction of more specific concepts, for example, felines. Relevance feedback is not necessarily popular with users. Users are often reluctant to provide explicit feedback, or in general do not wish to prolong the search interaction. Furthermore, it is often harder to understand why a particular document was retrieved after relevance feedback is applied. Relevance feedback can also have practical problems. The long queries that are generated by straightforward application of relevance feedback techniques are inefficient for a typical IR system. This results in a high computing cost for the retrieval and potentially long response times for the user. A partial solution to this is to only reweight certain prominent terms in the relevant documents, such as perhaps the top 20 terms by term frequency. Some experimental results have also suggested that using a limited number of terms like this may give better results (Harman, 1992) though other work has suggested that using more terms is better in terms of retrieved document quality (Buckley et al., 1994b).

  <TITLE>9.1.4 Relevance feedback on the web</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Relevance feedback on the web Some web search engines offer a similar/related pages feature: the user indicates a document in the results set as exemplary from the standpoint of meeting his information need and requests more documents like it. This can be viewed as a particular simple form of relevance feedback. However, in general relevance feedback has been little used in web search. One exception was the Excite web search engine, which initially provided full relevance feedback. However, the feature was in time dropped, due to lack of use. On the web, few people use advanced search interfaces and most would like to complete their search in a single interaction. But the lack of uptake also probably reflects two other factors: relevance feedback is hard to explain to the average user, and relevance feedback is mainly a recall enhancing strategy, and web search users are only rarely concerned with getting sufficient recall. Spink et al. (2000) present results from the use of relevance feedback in the Excite search engine. Only about 4% of user query sessions used the relevance feedback option, and these were usually exploiting the ``More like this'' link next to each result. About 70% of users only looked at the first page of results and did not pursue things any further. For people who used relevance feedback, results were improved about two thirds of the time. An important more recent thread of work is the use of clickstream data (what links a user clicks on) to provide indirect relevance feedback. Use of this data is studied in detail in (Joachims, 2002b, Joachims et al., 2005). The very successful use of web link structure (see Chapter 21 ) can also be viewed as implicit feedback, but provided by page authors rather than readers (though in practice most authors are also readers). Exercises. In Rocchio's algorithm, what weight setting for does a ``Find pages like this one'' search correspond to? Give three reasons why relevance feedback has been little used in web search.

  <TITLE>9.1.5 Evaluation of relevance feedback strategies</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Evaluation of relevance feedback strategies Interactive relevance feedback can give very substantial gains in retrieval performance. Empirically, one round of relevance feedback is often very useful. Two rounds is sometimes marginally more useful. Successful use of relevance feedback requires enough judged documents, otherwise the process is unstable in that it may drift away from the user's information need. Accordingly, having at least five judged documents is recommended. There is some subtlety to evaluating the effectiveness of relevance feedback in a sound and enlightening way. The obvious first strategy is to start with an initial query and to compute a precision-recall graph. Following one round of feedback from the user, we compute the modified query and again compute a precision-recall graph. Here, in both rounds we assess performance over all documents in the collection, which makes comparisons straightforward. If we do this, we find spectacular gains from relevance feedback: gains on the order of 50% in mean average precision. But unfortunately it is cheating. The gains are partly due to the fact that known relevant documents (judged by the user) are now ranked higher. Fairness demands that we should only evaluate with respect to documents not seen by the user. A second idea is to use documents in the residual collection (the set of documents minus those assessed relevant) for the second round of evaluation. This seems like a more realistic evaluation. Unfortunately, the measured performance can then often be lower than for the original query. This is particularly the case if there are few relevant documents, and so a fair proportion of them have been judged by the user in the first round. The relative performance of variant relevance feedback methods can be validly compared, but it is difficult to validly compare performance with and without relevance feedback because the collection size and the number of relevant documents changes from before the feedback to after it. Thus neither of these methods is fully satisfactory. A third method is to have two collections, one which is used for the initial query and relevance judgments, and the second that is then used for comparative evaluation. The performance of both and can be validly compared on the second collection. Perhaps the best evaluation of the utility of relevance feedback is to do user studies of its effectiveness, in particular by doing a time-based comparison: how fast does a user find relevant documents with relevance feedback vs. another strategy (such as query reformulation), or alternatively, how many relevant documents does a user find in a certain amount of time. Such notions of user utility are fairest and closest to real system usage.

  <TITLE>9.1.6 Pseudo relevance feedback</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Pseudo relevance feedback Pseudo relevance feedback , also known as blind relevance feedback , provides a method for automatic local analysis. It automates the manual part of relevance feedback, so that the user gets improved retrieval performance without an extended interaction. The method is to do normal retrieval to find an initial set of most relevant documents, to then assume that the top ranked documents are relevant, and finally to do relevance feedback as before under this assumption.   This automatic technique mostly works. Evidence suggests that it tends to work better than global analysis (Section 9.2 ). It has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task. See for example the results in Figure 9.5 . But it is not without the dangers of an automatic process. For example, if the query is about copper mines and the top several documents are all about mines in Chile, then there may be query drift in the direction of documents on Chile.

  <TITLE>9.1.7 Indirect relevance feedback</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Indirect relevance feedback We can also use indirect sources of evidence rather than explicit feedback on relevance as the basis for relevance feedback. This is often called implicit (relevance) feedback . Implicit feedback is less reliable than explicit feedback, but is more useful than pseudo relevance feedback, which contains no evidence of user judgments. Moreover, while users are often reluctant to provide explicit feedback, it is easy to collect implicit feedback in large quantities for a high volume system, such as a web search engine. On the web, DirectHit introduced the idea of ranking more highly documents that users chose to look at more often. In other words, clicks on links were assumed to indicate that the page was likely relevant to the query. This approach makes various assumptions, such as that the document summaries displayed in results lists (on whose basis users choose which documents to click on) are indicative of the relevance of these documents. In the original DirectHit search engine, the data about the click rates on pages was gathered globally, rather than being user or query specific. This is one form of the general area of clickstream mining . Today, a closely related approach is used in ranking the advertisements that match a web search query (Chapter 19 ).

  <TITLE>9.1.8 Summary</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Summary Relevance feedback has been shown to be very effective at improving relevance of results. Its successful use requires queries for which the set of relevant documents is medium to large. Full relevance feedback is often onerous for the user, and its implementation is not very efficient in most IR systems. In many cases, other types of interactive retrieval may improve relevance by about as much with less work. Beyond the core ad hoc retrieval scenario, other uses of relevance feedback include: Following a changing information need (e.g., names of car models of interest change over time) Maintaining an information filter (e.g., for a news feed). Such filters are discussed further in Chapter 13 . Active learning (deciding which examples it is most useful to know the class of to reduce annotation costs). Exercises. Under what conditions would the modified query in Equation 49 be the same as the original query ? In all other cases, is closer than to the centroid of the relevant documents? Why is positive feedback likely to be more useful than negative feedback to an IR system? Why might only using one nonrelevant document be more effective than using several? Suppose that a user's initial query is cheap CDs cheap DVDs extremely cheap CDs. The user examines two documents, and . She judges , with the content CDs cheap software cheap CDs relevant and with content cheap thrills DVDs nonrelevant. Assume that we are using direct term frequency (with no scaling and no document frequency). There is no need to length-normalize vectors. Using Rocchio relevance feedback as in Equation 49 what would the revised query vector be after relevance feedback? Assume . Omar has implemented a relevance feedback web search system, where he is going to do relevance feedback based only on words in the title text returned for a page (for efficiency). The user is going to rank 3 results. The first user, Jinxing, queries for: banana slug and the top three titles returned are: banana slug Ariolimax columbianus Santa Cruz mountains banana slug Santa Cruz Campus Mascot Jinxing judges the first two documents relevant, and the third nonrelevant. Assume that Omar's search engine uses term frequency but no length normalization nor IDF. Assume that he is using the Rocchio relevance feedback mechanism, with .

  <TITLE>9.2.2 Query expansion</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Query expansion  An example of query expansion in the interface of the Yahoo! web search engine in 2006.The expanded query suggestions appear just below the ``Search Results'' bar. In relevance feedback, users give additional input on documents (by marking documents in the results set as relevant or not), and this input is used to reweight the terms in the query for documents. In query expansion on the other hand, users give additional input on query words or phrases, possibly suggesting additional query terms. Some search engines (especially on the web) suggest related queries in response to a query; the users then opt to use one of these alternative query suggestions. Figure 9.6 shows an example of query suggestion options being presented in the Yahoo! web search engine. The central question in this form of query expansion is how to generate alternative or expanded queries for the user. The most common form of query expansion is global analysis, using some form of thesaurus. For each term in a query, the query can be automatically expanded with synonyms and related words of from the thesaurus. Use of a thesaurus can be combined with ideas of term weighting: for instance, one might weight added terms less than original query terms.   Methods for building a thesaurus for query expansion include: Use of a controlled vocabulary that is maintained by human editors. Here, there is a canonical term for each concept. The subject headings of traditional library subject indexes, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, or the Dewey Decimal system are examples of a controlled vocabulary. Use of a controlled vocabulary is quite common for well-resourced domains. A well-known example is the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) used with MedLine for querying the biomedical research literature. For example, in Figure 9.7 , neoplasms was added to a search for cancer. This Medline query expansion also contrasts with the Yahoo! example. The Yahoo! interface is a case of interactive query expansion, whereas PubMed does automatic query expansion. Unless the user chooses to examine the submitted query, they may not even realize that query expansion has occurred. A manual thesaurus. Here, human editors have built up sets of synonymous names for concepts, without designating a canonical term. The UMLS metathesaurus is one example of a thesaurus. Statistics Canada maintains a thesaurus of preferred terms, synonyms, broader terms, and narrower terms for matters on which the government collects statistics, such as goods and services. This thesaurus is also bilingual English and French. An automatically derived thesaurus. Here, word co-occurrence statistics over a collection of documents in a domain are used to automatically induce a thesaurus; see Section 9.2.3 . Query reformulations based on query log mining. Here, we exploit the manual query reformulations of other users to make suggestions to a new user. This requires a huge query volume, and is thus particularly appropriate to web search.

  <TITLE>9.2.3 Automatic thesaurus generation</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Automatic thesaurus generation As an alternative to the cost of a manual thesaurus, we could attempt to generate a thesaurus automatically by analyzing a collection of documents. There are two main approaches. One is simply to exploit word cooccurrence. We say that words co-occurring in a document or paragraph are likely to be in some sense similar or related in meaning, and simply count text statistics to find the most similar words. The other approach is to use a shallow grammatical analysis of the text and to exploit grammatical relations or grammatical dependencies. For example, we say that entities that are grown, cooked, eaten, and digested, are more likely to be food items. Simply using word cooccurrence is more robust (it cannot be misled by parser errors), but using grammatical relations is more accurate.   The simplest way to compute a co-occurrence thesaurus is based on term-term similarities. We begin with a term-document matrix , where each cell is a weighted count for term and document , with weighting so has length-normalized rows. If we then calculate , then is a similarity score between terms and , with a larger number being better. Figure 9.8 shows an example of a thesaurus derived in basically this manner, but with an extra step of dimensionality reduction via Latent Semantic Indexing, which we discuss in Chapter 18 . While some of the thesaurus terms are good or at least suggestive, others are marginal or bad. The quality of the associations is typically a problem. Term ambiguity easily introduces irrelevant statistically correlated terms. For example, a query for Apple computer may expand to Apple red fruit computer. In general these thesauri suffer from both false positives and false negatives. Moreover, since the terms in the automatic thesaurus are highly correlated in documents anyway (and often the collection used to derive the thesaurus is the same as the one being indexed), this form of query expansion may not retrieve many additional documents. Query expansion is often effective in increasing recall. However, there is a high cost to manually producing a thesaurus and then updating it for scientific and terminological developments within a field. In general a domain-specific thesaurus is required: general thesauri and dictionaries give far too little coverage of the rich domain-particular vocabularies of most scientific fields. However, query expansion may also significantly decrease precision, particularly when the query contains ambiguous terms. For example, if the user searches for interest rate, expanding the query to interest rate fascinate evaluate is unlikely to be useful. Overall, query expansion is less successful than relevance feedback, though it may be as good as pseudo relevance feedback. It does, however, have the advantage of being much more understandable to the system user. Exercises. If is simply a Boolean cooccurrence matrix, then what do you get as the entries in ?

  <TITLE>9.3 References and further reading</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   References and further reading Work in information retrieval quickly confronted the problem of variant expression which meant that the words in a query might not appear in a document, despite it being relevant to the query. An early experiment about 1960 cited by Swanson (1988) found that only 11 out of 23 documents properly indexed under the subject toxicity had any use of a word containing the stem toxi. There is also the issue of translation, of users knowing what terms a document will use. Blair and Maron (1985) conclude that ``it is impossibly difficult for users to predict the exact words, word combinations, and phrases that are used by all (or most) relevant documents and only (or primarily) by those documents''. The main initial papers on relevance feedback using vector space models all appear in Salton (1971b), including the presentation of the Rocchio algorithm (Rocchio, 1971) and the Ide dec-hi variant along with evaluation of several variants (Ide, 1971). Another variant is to regard all documents in the collection apart from those judged relevant as nonrelevant, rather than only ones that are explicitly judged nonrelevant. However, Schütze et al. (1995) and Singhal et al. (1997) show that better results are obtained for routing by using only documents close to the query of interest rather than all documents. Other later work includes Salton and Buckley (1990), Riezler et al. (2007) (a statistical NLP approach to RF) and the recent survey paper Ruthven and Lalmas (2003). The effectiveness of interactive relevance feedback systems is discussed in (Harman, 1992, Buckley et al., 1994b, Salton, 1989). Koenemann and Belkin (1996) do user studies of the effectiveness of relevance feedback. Traditionally Roget's thesaurus has been the best known English language thesaurus (Roget, 1946). In recent computational work, people almost always use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), not only because it is free, but also because of its rich link structure. It is available at: http://wordnet.princeton.edu. Qiu and Frei (1993) and Schütze (1998) discuss automatic thesaurus generation. Xu and Croft (1996) explore using both local and global query expansion.

  <TITLE>Chapter 10 XML retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   XML retrieval Information retrieval systems are often contrasted with relational databases. Traditionally, IR systems have retrieved information from unstructured text - by which we mean ``raw'' text without markup. Databases are designed for querying relational data: sets of records that have values for predefined attributes such as employee number, title and salary. There are fundamental differences between information retrieval and database systems in terms of retrieval model, data structures and query language as shown in Table 10.1 .     RDB search unstructured retrieval structured retrieval objects records unstructured documents trees with text at leaves model relational model vector space   others ? main data structure table inverted index ? queries SQL free text queries ? RDB (relational database) search, unstructured information retrieval and structured information retrieval. There is no consensus yet as to which methods work best for structured retrieval although many researchers believe that XQuery (page 10.5 ) will become the standard for structured queries.  Some highly structured text search problems are most efficiently handled by a relational database, for example, if the employee table contains an attribute for short textual job descriptions and you want to find all employees who are involved with invoicing. In this case, the SQL query: select lastname from employees where job_desc like 'invoic%'; However, many structured data sources containing text are best modeled as structured documents rather than relational data. We call the search over such structured documents structured retrieval . Queries in structured retrieval can be either structured or unstructured, but we will assume in this chapter that the collection consists only of structured documents. Applications of structured retrieval include digital libraries , patent databases , , text in which entities like persons and locations have been tagged (in a process called ) and output from office suites like OpenOffice that save documents as marked up text. In all of these applications, we want to be able to run queries that combine textual criteria with structural criteria. Examples of such queries are give me a full-length article on fast fourier transforms (digital libraries), give me patents whose claims mention RSA public key encryption and that cite US patent 4,405,829 (patents), or give me articles about sightseeing tours of the Vatican and the Coliseum (entity-tagged text). These three queries are structured queries that cannot be answered well by an unranked retrieval system. As we argued in westlaw unranked retrieval models like the Boolean model suffer from low recall. For instance, an unranked system would return a potentially large number of articles that mention the Vatican, the Coliseum and sightseeing tours without ranking the ones that are most relevant for the query first. Most users are also notoriously bad at precisely stating structural constraints. For instance, users may not know for which structured elements the search system supports search. In our example, the user may be unsure whether to issue the query as sightseeing AND (COUNTRY:Vatican OR LANDMARK:Coliseum) , as sightseeing AND (STATE:Vatican OR BUILDING:Coliseum) or in some other form. Users may also be completely unfamiliar with structured search and advanced search interfaces or unwilling to use them. In this chapter, we look at how ranked retrieval methods can be adapted to structured documents to address these problems. We will only look at one standard for encoding structured documents: Extensible Markup Language or XML , which is currently the most widely used such standard. We will not cover the specifics that distinguish XML from other types of markup such as HTML and SGML. But most of what we say in this chapter is applicable to markup languages in general. In the context of information retrieval, we are only interested in XML as a language for encoding text and documents. A perhaps more widespread use of XML is to encode non-text data. For example, we may want to export data in XML format from an enterprise resource planning system and then read them into an analytics program to produce graphs for a presentation. This type of application of XML is called data-centric because numerical and non-text attribute-value data dominate and text is usually a small fraction of the overall data. Most data-centric XML is stored in databases - in contrast to the inverted index-based methods for text-centric XML that we present in this chapter. We call XML retrieval structured retrieval in this chapter. Some researchers prefer the term semistructured retrieval to distinguish XML retrieval from database querying. We have adopted the terminology that is widespread in the XML retrieval community. For instance, the standard way of referring to XML queries is structured queries , not semistructured queries . The term structured retrieval is rarely used for database querying and it always refers to XML retrieval in this book. There is a second type of information retrieval problem that is intermediate between unstructured retrieval and querying a relational database: parametric and zone search, which we discussed in Section 6.1 (page ). In the data model of parametric and zone search, there are parametric fields (relational attributes like date or file-size) and zones - text attributes that each take a chunk of unstructured text as value, e.g., author and title in Figure 6.1 (page ). The data model is flat, that is, there is no nesting of attributes. The number of attributes is small. In contrast, XML documents have the more complex tree structure that we see in Figure 10.2 in which attributes are nested. The number of attributes and nodes is greater than in parametric and zone search. After presenting the basic concepts of XML in Section 10.1 , this chapter first discusses the challenges we face in XML retrieval (Section 10.2 ). Next we describe a vector space model for XML retrieval (Section 10.3 ). Section 10.4 presents INEX, a shared task evaluation that has been held for a number of years and currently is the most important venue for XML retrieval research. We discuss the differences between data-centric and text-centric approaches to XML in Section 10.5 .

   Basic XML concepts Figure 10.1: An XML document.  XML element  tag  XML attributes 10.1    Figure 10.2: The XML document in Figure 10.1 as a simplified DOM object. Figure 10.2 shows Figure 10.1 as a tree. The leaf nodes of the tree consist of text, e.g., Shakespeare, Macbeth, and Macbeth's castle. The tree's internal nodes encode either the structure of the document (title, act, and scene) or metadata functions (author). The standard for accessing and processing XML documents is the XML Document Object Model or DOM . The DOM represents elements, attributes and text within elements as nodes in a tree. Figure 10.2 is a simplified DOM representation of the XML document in Figure 10.1 .With a DOM API, we can process an XML document by starting at the root element and then descending down the tree from parents to children. XPath is a standard for enumerating paths in an XML document collection. We will also refer to paths as XML contexts or simply contexts in this chapter. Only a small subset of XPath is needed for our purposes. The XPath expression node selects all nodes of that name. Successive elements of a path are separated by slashes, so act/scene selects all scene elements whose parent is an act element. Double slashes indicate that an arbitrary number of elements can intervene on a path: play//scene selects all scene elements occurring in a play element. In Figure 10.2 this set consists of a single scene element, which is accessible via the path play, act, scene from the top. An initial slash starts the path at the root element. /play/title selects the play's title in Figure 10.1 , /play//title selects a set with two members (the play's title and the scene's title), and /scene/title selects no elements. For notational convenience, we allow the final element of a path to be a vocabulary term and separate it from the element path by the symbol #, even though this does not conform to the XPath standard. For example, title#"Macbeth" selects all titles containing the term Macbeth. We also need the concept of schema in this chapter. A schema puts constraints on the structure of allowable XML documents for a particular application. A schema for Shakespeare's plays may stipulate that scenes can only occur as children of acts and that only acts and scenes have the number attribute. Two standards for schemas for XML documents are XML DTD (document type definition) and XML Schema . Users can only write structured queries for an XML retrieval system if they have some minimal knowledge about the schema of the collection.  Figure 10.3: An XML query in NEXI format and its partial representation as a tree. A common format for XML queries is NEXI (Narrowed Extended XPath I). We give an example in Figure 10.3 . We display the query on four lines for typographical convenience, but it is intended to be read as one unit without line breaks. In particular, //section is embedded under //article. The query in Figure 10.3 specifies a search for sections about the summer holidays that are part of articles from 2001 or 2002. As in XPath double slashes indicate that an arbitrary number of elements can intervene on a path. The dot in a clause in square brackets refers to the element the clause modifies. The clause [.//yr = 2001 or .//yr = 2002] modifies //article. Thus, the dot refers to //article in this case. Similarly, the dot in [about(., summer holidays)] refers to the section that the clause modifies. The two yr conditions are relational attribute constraints. Only articles whose yr attribute is 2001 or 2002 (or that contain an element whose yr attribute is 2001 or 2002) are to be considered. The about clause is a ranking constraint: Sections that occur in the right type of article are to be ranked according to how relevant they are to the topic summer holidays.  Figure 10.4: Tree representation of XML documents and queries. We usually handle relational attribute constraints by prefiltering or postfiltering: We simply exclude all elements from the result set that do not meet the relational attribute constraints. In this chapter, we will not address how to do this efficiently and instead focus on the core information retrieval problem in XML retrieval, namely how to rank documents according to the relevance criteria expressed in the about conditions of the NEXI query. If we discard relational attributes, we can represent documents as trees with only one type of node: element nodes. In other words, we remove all attribute nodes from the XML document, such as the number attribute in Figure 10.1 . Figure 10.4 shows a subtree of the document in Figure 10.1 as an element-node tree (labeled ). We can represent queries as trees in the same way. This is a query-by-example approach to query language design because users pose queries by creating objects that satisfy the same formal description as documents. In Figure 10.4 , is a search for books whose titles score highly for the keywords Julius Caesar. is a search for books whose author elements score highly for Julius Caesar and whose title elements score highly for Gallic war.

  <TITLE>10.2 Challenges in XML retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Challenges in XML retrieval In this section, we discuss a number of challenges that make structured retrieval more difficult than unstructured retrieval. Recall from page 10 the basic setting we assume in structured retrieval: the collection consists of structured documents and queries are either structured (as in Figure 10.3 ) or unstructured (e.g., summer holidays). The first challenge in structured retrieval is that users want us to return parts of documents (i.e., XML elements), not entire documents as IR systems usually do in unstructured retrieval. If we query Shakespeare's plays for Macbeth's castle, should we return the scene, the act or the entire play in Figure 10.2 ? In this case, the user is probably looking for the scene. On the other hand, an otherwise unspecified search for Macbeth should return the play of this name, not a subunit. One criterion for selecting the most appropriate part of a document is the structured document retrieval principle : Structured document retrieval principle. A system should always retrieve the most specific part of a document answering the query. title#"Macbeth" 10.2 Macbeth Macbeth's castle  Figure 10.5: Partitioning an XML document into non-overlapping indexing units. Parallel to the issue of which parts of a document to return to the user is the issue of which parts of a document to index. In Section 2.1.2 (page ), we discussed the need for a document unit or indexing unit in indexing and retrieval. In unstructured retrieval, it is usually clear what the right document unit is: files on your desktop, email messages, web pages on the web etc. In structured retrieval, there are a number of different approaches to defining the indexing unit. One approach is to group nodes into non-overlapping pseudodocuments as shown in Figure 10.5 . In the example, books, chapters and sections have been designated to be indexing units, but without overlap. For example, the leftmost dashed indexing unit contains only those parts of the tree dominated by book that are not already part of other indexing units. The disadvantage of this approach is that pseudodocuments may not make sense to the user because they are not coherent units. For instance, the leftmost indexing unit in Figure 10.5 merges three disparate elements, the class, author and title elements. We can also use one of the largest elements as the indexing unit, for example, the book element in a collection of books or the play element for Shakespeare's works. We can then postprocess search results to find for each book or play the subelement that is the best hit. For example, the query Macbeth's castle may return the play Macbeth, which we can then postprocess to identify act I, scene vii as the best-matching subelement. Unfortunately, this two-stage retrieval process fails to return the best subelement for many queries because the relevance of a whole book is often not a good predictor of the relevance of small subelements within it. Instead of retrieving large units and identifying subelements (top down), we can also search all leaves, select the most relevant ones and then extend them to larger units in postprocessing (bottom up). For the query Macbeth's castle in Figure 10.1 , we would retrieve the title Macbeth's castle in the first pass and then decide in a postprocessing step whether to return the title, the scene, the act or the play. This approach has a similar problem as the last one: The relevance of a leaf element is often not a good predictor of the relevance of elements it is contained in. The least restrictive approach is to index all elements. This is also problematic. Many XML elements are not meaningful search results, e.g., typographical elements like definitely or an ISBN number which cannot be interpreted without context. Also, indexing all elements means that search results will be highly redundant. For the query Macbeth's castle and the document in Figure 10.1 , we would return all of the play, act, scene and title elements on the path between the root node and Macbeth's castle. The leaf node would then occur four times in the result set, once directly and three times as part of other elements. We call elements that are contained within each other nested . Returning redundant nested elements in a list of returned hits is not very user-friendly. Because of the redundancy caused by nested elements it is common to restrict the set of elements that are eligible to be returned. Restriction strategies include: discard all small elements discard all element types that users do not look at (this requires a working XML retrieval system that logs this information) discard all element types that assessors generally do not judge to be relevant (if relevance assessments are available) only keep element types that a system designer or librarian has deemed to be useful search results  highlighting If the user knows the schema of the collection and is able to specify the desired type of element, then the problem of redundancy is alleviated as few nested elements have the same type. But as we discussed in the introduction, users often don't know what the name of an element in the collection is (Is the Vatican a country or a city?) or they may not know how to compose structured queries at all. A challenge in XML retrieval related to nesting is that we may need to distinguish different contexts of a term when we compute term statistics for ranking, in particular inverse document frequency ( idf ) statistics as defined in Section 6.2.1 (page ). For example, the term Gates under the node author is unrelated to an occurrence under a content node like section if used to refer to the plural of gate. It makes little sense to compute a single document frequency for Gates in this example. One solution is to compute idf for XML-contextterm pairs, e.g., to compute different idf weights for author#"Gates" and section#"Gates". Unfortunately, this scheme will run into sparse data problems - that is, many XML-context pairs occur too rarely to reliably estimate df (see Section 13.2 , page 13.2 , for a discussion of sparseness). A compromise is only to consider the parent node of the term and not the rest of the path from the root to to distinguish contexts. There are still conflations of contexts that are harmful in this scheme. For instance, we do not distinguish names of authors and names of corporations if both have the parent node name. But most important distinctions, like the example contrast author#"Gates" vs. section#"Gates", will be respected.  Figure 10.6: Schema heterogeneity: intervening nodes and mismatched names. In many cases, several different XML schemas occur in a collection since the XML documents in an IR application often come from more than one source. This phenomenon is called schema heterogeneity or schema diversity and presents yet another challenge. As illustrated in Figure 10.6 comparable elements may have different names: creator in vs. author in . In other cases, the structural organization of the schemas may be different: Author names are direct descendants of the node author in , but there are the intervening nodes firstname and lastname in . If we employ strict matching of trees, then will retrieve neither nor although both documents are relevant. Some form of approximate matching of element names in combination with semi-automatic matching of different document structures can help here. Human editing of correspondences of elements in different schemas will usually do better than automatic methods. Schema heterogeneity is one reason for query-document mismatches like and . Another reason is that users often are not familiar with the element names and the structure of the schemas of collections they search as mentioned. This poses a challenge for interface design in XML retrieval. Ideally, the user interface should expose the tree structure of the collection and allow users to specify the elements they are querying. If we take this approach, then designing the query interface in structured retrieval is more complex than a search box for keyword queries in unstructured retrieval. We can also support the user by interpreting all parent-child relationships in queries as descendant relationships with any number of intervening nodes allowed. We call such queries extended queries . The tree in Figure 10.3 and in Figure 10.6 are examples of extended queries. We show edges that are interpreted as descendant relationships as dashed arrows. In , a dashed arrow connects book and Gates. As a pseudo-XPath notation for , we adopt book//#"Gates": a book that somewhere in its structure contains the word Gates where the path from the book node to Gates can be arbitrarily long. The pseudo-XPath notation for the extended query that in addition specifies that Gates occurs in a section of the book is book//section//#"Gates". It is convenient for users to be able to issue such extended queries without having to specify the exact structural configuration in which a query term should occur - either because they do not care about the exact configuration or because they do not know enough about the schema of the collection to be able to specify it.  Figure 10.7: A structural mismatch between two queries and a document. In Figure 10.7 , the user is looking for a chapter entitled FFT (). Suppose there is no such chapter in the collection, but that there are references to books on FFT (). A reference to a book on FFT is not exactly what the user is looking for, but it is better than returning nothing. Extended queries do not help here. The extended query also returns nothing. This is a case where we may want to interpret the structural constraints specified in the query as hints as opposed to as strict conditions. As we will discuss in Section 10.4 , users prefer a relaxed interpretation of structural constraints: Elements that do not meet structural constraints perfectly should be ranked lower, but they should not be omitted from search results.

  <TITLE>10.3 A vector space model for XML retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   A vector space model for XML retrieval  Figure 10.8: A mapping of an XML document (left) to a set of lexicalized subtrees (right). To take account of structure in retrieval in Figure 10.4 , we want a book entitled Julius Caesar to be a match for and no match (or a lower weighted match) for . In unstructured retrieval, there would be a single dimension of the vector space for Caesar. In XML retrieval, we must separate the title word Caesar from the author name Caesar. One way of doing this is to have each dimension of the vector space encode a word together with its position within the XML tree. Figure 10.8 illustrates this representation. We first take each text node (which in our setup is always a leaf) and break it into multiple nodes, one for each word. So the leaf node Bill Gates is split into two leaves Bill and Gates. Next we define the dimensions of the vector space to be lexicalized subtrees of documents - subtrees that contain at least one vocabulary term. A subset of these possible lexicalized subtrees is shown in the figure, but there are others - e.g., the subtree corresponding to the whole document with the leaf node Gates removed. We can now represent queries and documents as vectors in this space of lexicalized subtrees and compute matches between them. This means that we can use the vector space formalism from Chapter 6 for XML retrieval. The main difference is that the dimensions of vector space in unstructured retrieval are vocabulary terms whereas they are lexicalized subtrees in XML retrieval. There is a tradeoff between the dimensionality of the space and accuracy of query results. If we trivially restrict dimensions to vocabulary terms, then we have a standard vector space retrieval system that will retrieve many documents that do not match the structure of the query (e.g., Gates in the title as opposed to the author element). If we create a separate dimension for each lexicalized subtree occurring in the collection, the dimensionality of the space becomes too large. A compromise is to index all paths that end in a single vocabulary term, in other words, all XML-contextterm pairs. We call such an XML-contextterm pair a structural term and denote it by : a pair of XML-context and vocabulary term . The document in Figure 10.8 has nine structural terms. Seven are shown (e.g., "Bill" and Author#"Bill") and two are not shown: /Book/Author#"Bill" and /Book/Author#"Gates". The tree with the leaves Bill and Gates is a lexicalized subtree that is not a structural term. We use the previously introduced pseudo-XPath notation for structural terms. As we discussed in the last section users are bad at remembering details about the schema and at constructing queries that comply with the schema. We will therefore interpret all queries as extended queries - that is, there can be an arbitrary number of intervening nodes in the document for any parent-child node pair in the query. For example, we interpret in Figure 10.7 as . But we still prefer documents that match the query structure closely by inserting fewer additional nodes. We ensure that retrieval results respect this preference by computing a weight for each match. A simple measure of the similarity of a path in a query and a path in a document is the following context resemblance function CR: (52)        10.6            The final score for a document is computed as a variant of the cosine measure (Equation 24, page 6.3.1 ), which we call SIMNOMERGE for reasons that will become clear shortly. SIMNOMERGE is defined as follows: (53)          6    10.2  10.7  6.3.1 6.3.1   Figure 10.9: The algorithm for scoring documents with S IMN OM ERGE. IM O ERGE 10.9 normalizer 10.9  53  Figure 10.10: Scoring of a query with one structural term in S IMN OM ERGE. We give an example of how SIMNOMERGE computes query-document similarities in Figure 10.10 . is one of the structural terms in the query. We successively retrieve all postings lists for structural terms with the same vocabulary term . Three example postings lists are shown. For the first one, we have since the two contexts are identical. The next context has no context resemblance with : and the corresponding postings list is ignored. The context match of with is 0.63>0 and it will be processed. In this example, the highest ranking document is with a similarity of . To simplify the figure, the query weight of is assumed to be 1.0. The query-document similarity function in Figure 10.9 is called SIMNOMERGE because different XML contexts are kept separate for the purpose of weighting. An alternative similarity function is SIMMERGE which relaxes the matching conditions of query and document further in the following three ways. We collect the statistics used for computing and from all contexts that have a non-zero resemblance to (as opposed to just from as in SIMNOMERGE). For instance, for computing the document frequency of the structural term atl#"recognition", we also count occurrences of recognition in XML contexts fm/atl, article//atl etc. We modify Equation 53 by merging all structural terms in the document that have a non-zero context resemblance to a given query structural term. For example, the contexts /play/act/scene/title and /play/title in the document will be merged when matching against the query term /play/title#"Macbeth". The context resemblance function is further relaxed: Contexts have a non-zero resemblance in many cases where the definition of CR in Equation 52 returns 0. 10.6 These three changes alleviate the problem of sparse term statistics discussed in Section 10.2 and increase the robustness of the matching function against poorly posed structural queries. The evaluation of SIMNOMERGE and SIMMERGE in the next section shows that the relaxed matching conditions of SIMMERGE increase the effectiveness of XML retrieval. Exercises. Consider computing df for a structural term as the number of times that the structural term occurs under a particular parent node. Assume the following: the structural term author#"Herbert" occurs once as the child of the node squib; there are 10 squib nodes in the collection; occurs 1000 times as the child of article; there are 1,000,000 article nodes in the collection. The idf weight of then is when occurring as the child of squib and when occurring as the child of article. (i) Explain why this is not an appropriate weighting for . Why should not receive a weight that is three times higher in articles than in squibs? (ii) Suggest a better way of computing idf. Write down all the structural terms occurring in the XML document in Figure 10.8 . How many structural terms does the document in Figure 10.1 yield?

  <TEXT>
   Evaluation of XML retrieval   Table 10.2: INEX 2002 collection statistics. 12,107 number of documents 494 MB size 1995-2002 time of publication of articles 1,532 average number of XML nodes per document 6.9 average depth of a node 30 number of CAS topics 30 number of CO topics    Figure 10.11: Simplified schema of the documents in the INEX collection. The premier venue for research on XML retrieval is the INEX (INitiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval) program, a collaborative effort that has produced reference collections, sets of queries, and relevance judgments. A yearly INEX meeting is held to present and discuss research results. The INEX 2002 collection consisted of about 12,000 articles from IEEE journals. We give collection statistics in Table 10.2 and show part of the schema of the collection in Figure 10.11 . The IEEE journal collection was expanded in 2005. Since 2006 INEX uses the much larger English Wikipedia as a test collection. The relevance of documents is judged by human assessors using the methodology introduced in Section 8.1 (page ), appropriately modified for structured documents as we will discuss shortly. Two types of information needs or in INEX are content-only or CO topics and content-and-structure (CAS) topics. CO topics are regular keyword queries as in unstructured information retrieval. CAS topics have structural constraints in addition to keywords. We already encountered an example of a CAS topic in Figure 10.3 . The keywords in this case are summer and holidays and the structural constraints specify that the keywords occur in a section that in turn is part of an article and that this article has an embedded year attribute with value 2001 or 2002. Since CAS queries have both structural and content criteria, relevance assessments are more complicated than in unstructured retrieval. INEX 2002 defined component coverage and topical relevance as orthogonal dimensions of relevance. The component coverage dimension evaluates whether the element retrieved is ``structurally'' correct, i.e., neither too low nor too high in the tree. We distinguish four cases: Exact coverage (E). The information sought is the main topic of the component and the component is a meaningful unit of information. Too small (S). The information sought is the main topic of the component, but the component is not a meaningful (self-contained) unit of information. Too large (L). The information sought is present in the component, but is not the main topic. No coverage (N). The information sought is not a topic of the component. The topical relevance dimension also has four levels: highly relevant (3), fairly relevant (2), marginally relevant (1) and nonrelevant (0). Components are judged on both dimensions and the judgments are then combined into a digit-letter code. 2S is a fairly relevant component that is too small and 3E is a highly relevant component that has exact coverage. In theory, there are 16 combinations of coverage and relevance, but many cannot occur. For example, a nonrelevant component cannot have exact coverage, so the combination 3N is not possible. The relevance-coverage combinations are quantized as follows: (54)  8.5.1 8.5.1 Q The number of relevant components in a retrieved set of components can then be computed as: (55)  8 10.6 One flaw of measuring relevance this way is that overlap is not accounted for. We discussed the concept of marginal relevance in the context of unstructured retrieval in Section 8.5.1 (page ). This problem is worse in XML retrieval because of the problem of multiple nested elements occurring in a search result as we discussed on page 10.2 . Much of the recent focus at INEX has been on developing algorithms and evaluation measures that return non-redundant results lists and evaluate them properly. See the references in Section 10.6 .   Table 10.3: INEX 2002 results of the vector space model in Section 10.3 for content-and-structure (CAS) queries and the quantization function Q. algorithm average precision SIMNOMERGE 0.242 SIMMERGE 0.271   Table 10.3 shows two INEX 2002 runs of the vector space system we described in Section 10.3 . The better run is the SIMMERGE run, which incorporates few structural constraints and mostly relies on keyword matching. SIMMERGE's median average precision (where the median is with respect to average precision numbers over topics) is only 0.147. Effectiveness in XML retrieval is often lower than in unstructured retrieval since XML retrieval is harder. Instead of just finding a document, we have to find the subpart of a document that is most relevant to the query. Also, XML retrieval effectiveness - when evaluated as described here - can be lower than unstructured retrieval effectiveness on a standard evaluation because graded judgments lower measured performance. Consider a system that returns a document with graded relevance 0.6 and binary relevance 1 at the top of the retrieved list. Then, interpolated precision at 0.00 recall (cf. page 8.4 ) is 1.0 on a binary evaluation, but can be as low as 0.6 on a graded evaluation.   Table 10.4: A comparison of content-only and full-structure search in INEX 2003/2004.   content only full structure improvement precision at 5 0.2000 0.3265 63.3% precision at 10 0.1820 0.2531 39.1% precision at 20 0.1700 0.1796 5.6% precision at 30 0.1527 0.1531 0.3%   Table 10.3 gives us a sense of the typical performance of XML retrieval, but it does not compare structured with unstructured retrieval. Table 10.4 directly shows the effect of using structure in retrieval. The results are for a language-model-based system (cf. Chapter 12 ) that is evaluated on a subset of CAS topics from INEX 2003 and 2004. The evaluation metric is precision at as defined in Chapter 8 (page 8.4 ). The discretization function used for the evaluation maps highly relevant elements (roughly corresponding to the 3E elements defined for Q) to 1 and all other elements to 0. The content-only system treats queries and documents as unstructured bags of words. The full-structure model ranks elements that satisfy structural constraints higher than elements that do not. For instance, for the query in Figure 10.3 an element that contains the phrase summer holidays in a section will be rated higher than one that contains it in an abstract. The table shows that structure helps increase precision at the top of the results list. There is a large increase of precision at and at . There is almost no improvement at . These results demonstrate the benefits of structured retrieval. Structured retrieval imposes additional constraints on what to return and documents that pass the structural filter are more likely to be relevant. Recall may suffer because some relevant documents will be filtered out, but for precision-oriented tasks structured retrieval is superior.

  <TITLE>10.5 Text-centric vs. data-centric XML retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Text-centric vs. data-centric XML retrieval  text-centric XML   In contrast, data-centric XML mainly encodes numerical and non-text attribute-value data. When querying data-centric XML, we want to impose exact match conditions in most cases. This puts the emphasis on the structural aspects of XML documents and queries. An example is: Find employees whose salary is the same this month as it was 12 months ago. Text-centric approaches are appropriate for data that are essentially text documents, marked up as XML to capture document structure. This is becoming a de facto standard for publishing text databases since most text documents have some form of interesting structure - paragraphs, sections, footnotes etc. Examples include assembly manuals, issues of journals, Shakespeare's collected works and newswire articles. Data-centric approaches are commonly used for data collections with complex structures that mainly contain non-text data. A text-centric retrieval engine will have a hard time with proteomic data in bioinformatics or with the representation of a city map that (together with street names and other textual descriptions) forms a navigational database. Two other types of queries that are difficult to handle in a text-centric structured retrieval model are joins and ordering constraints. The query for employees with unchanged salary requires a join. The following query imposes an ordering constraint: Retrieve the chapter of the book Introduction to algorithms that follows the chapter Binomial heaps.  Relational databases are better equipped to handle many structural constraints, particularly joins (but ordering is also difficult in a database framework - the tuples of a relation in the relational calculus are not ordered). For this reason, most data-centric XML retrieval systems are extensions of relational databases (see the references in Section 10.6 ). If text fields are short, exact matching meets user needs and retrieval results in form of unordered sets are acceptable, then using a relational database for XML retrieval is appropriate.

We chose to present the vector space model for XML retrieval because it is simple and a natural extension of the unstructured vector space model in Chapter 6 . But many other unstructured retrieval methods have been applied to XML retrieval with at least as much success as the vector space model. These methods include language models (cf. Chapter 12 , e.g., Kamps et al. (2004), Ogilvie and Callan (2005), List et al. (2005)), systems that use a relational database as a backend (Theobald et al., 2008;2005, Mihajlovic et al., 2005), probabilistic weighting (Lu et al., 2007), and fusion (Larson, 2005). There is currently no consensus as to what the best approach to XML retrieval is. Most early work on XML retrieval accomplished relevance ranking by focusing on individual terms, including their structural contexts, in query and document. As in unstructured information retrieval, there is a trend in more recent work to model relevance ranking as combining evidence from disparate measurements about the query, the document and their match. The combination function can be tuned manually (Sigurbjörnsson et al., 2004, Arvola et al., 2005) or trained using machine learning methods (Vittaut and Gallinari (2006), cf. mls). An active area of XML retrieval research is focused retrieval (Trotman et al., 2007), which aims to avoid returning nested elements that share one or more common subelements (cf. discussion in Section 10.2 , page 10.2 ). There is evidence that users dislike redundancy caused by nested elements (Betsi et al., 2006). Focused retrieval requires evaluation measures that penalize redundant results lists (Kazai and Lalmas, 2006, Lalmas et al., 2007). Trotman and Geva (2006) argue that XML retrieval is a form of passage retrieval . In passage retrieval (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997, Salton et al., 1993, Hearst and Plaunt, 1993, Hearst, 1997, Zobel et al., 1995), the retrieval system returns short passages instead of documents in response to a user query. While element boundaries in XML documents are cues for identifying good segment boundaries between passages, the most relevant passage often does not coincide with an XML element. In the last several years, the query format at INEX has been the NEXI standard proposed by Trotman and Sigurbjörnsson (2004). Figure 10.3 is from their paper. O'Keefe and Trotman (2004) give evidence that users cannot reliably distinguish the child and descendant axes. This justifies only permitting descendant axes in NEXI (and XML fragments). These structural constraints were only treated as ``hints'' in recent INEXes. Assessors can judge an element highly relevant even though it violates one of the structural constraints specified in a NEXI query. An alternative to structured query languages like NEXI is a more sophisticated user interface for query formulation (Tannier and Geva, 2005, van Zwol, 2006, Woodley and Geva, 2006). A broad overview of XML retrieval that covers database as well as IR approaches is given by Amer-Yahia and Lalmas (2006) and an extensive reference list on the topic can be found in (Amer-Yahia et al., 2005). Chapter 6 of Grossman and Frieder (2004) is a good introduction to structured text retrieval from a database perspective. The proposed standard for XQuery is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/ including an extension for full-text queries (Amer-Yahia et al., 2006): http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-full-text/. Work that has looked at combining the relational database and the unstructured information retrieval approaches includes (Fuhr and Rölleke, 1997), (Navarro and Baeza-Yates, 1997), (Cohen, 1998), and (Chaudhuri et al., 2006).

Implement the (i) SIMMERGE (ii) SIMNOMERGE algorithm in Section 10.3 and run it for the collection and the topics in Exercise 10.7 . (iii) Evaluate the results by assigning binary relevance judgments to the first five documents of the three retrieved lists for each algorithm. Which algorithm performs better? Are all of the elements in Exercise 10.7 appropriate to be returned as hits to a user or are there elements (as in the example definitely on page 10.2 ) that you would exclude? We discussed the tradeoff between accuracy of results and dimensionality of the vector space on page 10.3 .

  <TITLE>Chapter 11 Probabilistic information retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Probabilistic information retrieval During the discussion of relevance feedback in Section 9.1.2 , we observed that if we have some known relevant and nonrelevant documents, then we can straightforwardly start to estimate the probability of a term appearing in a relevant document , and that this could be the basis of a classifier that decides whether documents are relevant or not. In this chapter, we more systematically introduce this probabilistic approach to IR, which provides a different formal basis for a retrieval model and results in different techniques for setting term weights. Users start with information needs, which they translate into query representations. Similarly, there are documents, which are converted into document representations (the latter differing at least by how text is tokenized, but perhaps containing fundamentally less information, as when a non-positional index is used). Based on these two representations, a system tries to determine how well documents satisfy information needs. In the Boolean or vector space models of IR, matching is done in a formally defined but semantically imprecise calculus of index terms. Given only a query, an IR system has an uncertain understanding of the information need. Given the query and document representations, a system has an uncertain guess of whether a document has content relevant to the information need. Probability theory provides a principled foundation for such reasoning under uncertainty. This chapter provides one answer as to how to exploit this foundation to estimate how likely it is that a document is relevant to an information need. There is more than one possible retrieval model which has a probabilistic basis. Here, we will introduce probability theory and the Probability Ranking Principle (Sections 11.1 -11.2 ), and then concentrate on the Binary Independence Model (Section 11.3 ), which is the original and still most influential probabilistic retrieval model. Finally, we will introduce related but extended methods which use term counts, including the empirically successful Okapi BM25 weighting scheme, and Bayesian Network models for IR (Section 11.4 ). In Chapter 12 , we then present the alternative probabilistic language modeling approach to IR, which has been developed with considerable success in recent years.

  <TEXT>
   Review of basic probability theory We hope that the reader has seen a little basic probability theory previously. We will give a very quick review; some references for further reading appear at the end of the chapter. A variable represents an event (a subset of the space of possible outcomes). Equivalently, we can represent the subset via a random variable , which is a function from outcomes to real numbers; the subset is the domain over which the random variable has a particular value. Often we will not know with certainty whether an event is true in the world. We can ask the probability of the event . For two events and , the joint event of both events occurring is described by the joint probability . The conditional probability expresses the probability of event given that event occurred. The fundamental relationship between joint and conditional probabilities is given by the chain rule : (56)  Writing for the complement of an event, we similarly have: (57)   partition rule    (58)  From these we can derive Bayes' Rule for inverting conditional probabilities: (59)    prior probability   posterior probability    likelihood    Finally, it is often useful to talk about the odds of an event, which provide a kind of multiplier for how probabilities change: (60)

  <TEXT>
   The 1/0 loss case We assume a ranked retrieval setup as in Section 6.3 , where there is a collection of documents, the user issues a query, and an ordered list of documents is returned. We also assume a binary notion of relevance as in Chapter 8 . For a query and a document in the collection, let be an indicator random variable that says whether is relevant with respect to a given query . That is, it takes on a value of 1 when the document is relevant and 0 otherwise. In context we will often write just for . Using a probabilistic model, the obvious order in which to present documents to the user is to rank documents by their estimated probability of relevance with respect to the information need: . This is the basis of the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) (van Rijsbergen, 1979, 113-114): ``If a reference retrieval system's response to each request is a ranking of the documents in the collection in order of decreasing probability of relevance to the user who submitted the request, where the probabilities are estimated as accurately as possible on the basis of whatever data have been made available to the system for this purpose, the overall effectiveness of the system to its user will be the best that is obtainable on the basis of those data.'' accuracy  1/0 loss     Bayes Optimal Decision Rule  (61)  Theorem. The PRP is optimal, in the sense that it minimizes the expected loss (also known as the Bayes risk ) under 1/0 loss. End theorem. The proof can be found in Ripley (1996). However, it requires that all probabilities are known correctly. This is never the case in practice. Nevertheless, the PRP still provides a very useful foundation for developing models of IR.

  <TITLE>11.3 The Binary Independence Model</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The Binary Independence Model The Binary Independence Model (BIM) we present in this section is the model that has traditionally been used with the PRP. It introduces some simple assumptions, which make estimating the probability function practical. Here, ``binary'' is equivalent to Boolean: documents and queries are both represented as binary term incidence vectors. That is, a document is represented by the vector where if term is present in document and if is not present in . With this representation, many possible documents have the same vector representation. Similarly, we represent by the incidence vector (the distinction between and is less central since commonly is in the form of a set of words). ``Independence'' means that terms are modeled as occurring in documents independently. The model recognizes no association between terms. This assumption is far from correct, but it nevertheless often gives satisfactory results in practice; it is the ``naive'' assumption of Naive Bayes models, discussed further in Section 13.4 (page ). Indeed, the Binary Independence Model is exactly the same as the multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes model presented in Section 13.3 (page ). In a sense this assumption is equivalent to an assumption of the vector space model, where each term is a dimension that is orthogonal to all other terms. We will first present a model which assumes that the user has a single step information need. As discussed in Chapter 9 , seeing a range of results might let the user refine their information need. Fortunately, as mentioned there, it is straightforward to extend the Binary Independence Model so as to provide a framework for relevance feedback, and we present this model in Section 11.3.4 . To make a probabilistic retrieval strategy precise, we need to estimate how terms in documents contribute to relevance, specifically, we wish to know how term frequency, document frequency, document length, and other statistics that we can compute influence judgments about document relevance, and how they can be reasonably combined to estimate the probability of document relevance. We then order documents by decreasing estimated probability of relevance. We assume here that the relevance of each document is independent of the relevance of other documents. As we noted in Section 8.5.1 (page ), this is incorrect: the assumption is especially harmful in practice if it allows a system to return duplicate or near duplicate documents. Under the BIM, we model the probability that a document is relevant via the probability in terms of term incidence vectors . Then, using Bayes rule, we have: (63) (64)            (65)    Subsections Deriving a ranking function for query terms Probability estimates in theory Probability estimates in practice Probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback

  <TITLE>11.3.1 Deriving a ranking function for query terms</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Deriving a ranking function for query terms Given a query , we wish to order returned documents by descending . Under the BIM, this is modeled as ordering by . Rather than estimating this probability directly, because we are interested only in the ranking of documents, we work with some other quantities which are easier to compute and which give the same ordering of documents. In particular, we can rank documents by their odds of relevance (as the odds of relevance is monotonic with the probability of relevance). This makes things easier, because we can ignore the common denominator in Rxq-bayes, giving: (66)  The left term in the rightmost expression of Equation 66 is a constant for a given query. Since we are only ranking documents, there is thus no need for us to estimate it. The right-hand term does, however, require estimation, and this initially appears to be difficult: How can we accurately estimate the probability of an entire term incidence vector occurring? It is at this point that we make the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption that the presence or absence of a word in a document is independent of the presence or absence of any other word (given the query): (67)   (68)    (69)       Let us make an additional simplifying assumption that terms not occurring in the query are equally likely to occur in relevant and nonrelevant documents: that is, if then . (This assumption can be changed, as when doing relevance feedback in Section 11.3.4 .) Then we need only consider terms in the products that appear in the query, and so, (70)  We can manipulate this expression by including the query terms found in the document into the right product, but simultaneously dividing through by them in the left product, so the value is unchanged. Then we have: (71)    Retrieval Status Value  (72)  So everything comes down to computing the . Define : (73)      odds ratio   7.1

   Probability estimates in theory For each term , what would these numbers look like for the whole collection? odds-ratio-ct-contingency gives a contingency table of counts of documents in the collection, where is the number of documents that contain term : Using this, and and (74)   add   (75)  Adding in this way is a simple form of smoothing. For trials with categorical outcomes (such as noting the presence or absence of a term), one way to estimate the probability of an event from data is simply to count the number of times an event occurred divided by the total number of trials. This is referred to as the relative frequency of the event. Estimating the probability as the relative frequency is the maximum likelihood estimate (or MLE ), because this value makes the observed data maximally likely. However, if we simply use the MLE, then the probability given to events we happened to see is usually too high, whereas other events may be completely unseen and giving them as a probability estimate their relative frequency of 0 is both an underestimate, and normally breaks our models, since anything multiplied by 0 is 0. Simultaneously decreasing the estimated probability of seen events and increasing the probability of unseen events is referred to as smoothing . One simple way of smoothing is to add a number to each of the observed counts. These pseudocounts correspond to the use of a uniform distribution over the vocabulary as a Bayesian prior , following Equation 59. We initially assume a uniform distribution over events, where the size of denotes the strength of our belief in uniformity, and we then update the probability based on observed events. Since our belief in uniformity is weak, we use . This is a form of maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimation, where we choose the most likely point value for probabilities based on the prior and the observed evidence, following Equation 59. We will further discuss methods of smoothing estimated counts to give probability models in Section 12.2.2 (page ); the simple method of adding to each observed count will do for now.

   Probability estimates in practice    (76)   idf 6.2.1 The approximation technique in Equation 76 cannot easily be extended to relevant documents. The quantity can be estimated in various ways: We can use the frequency of term occurrence in known relevant documents (if we know some). This is the basis of probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback weighting in a feedback loop, discussed in the next subsection. Croft and Harper (1979) proposed using a constant in their combination match model. For instance, we might assume that is constant over all terms in the query and that . This means that each term has even odds of appearing in a relevant document, and so the and factors cancel out in the expression for . Such an estimate is weak, but doesn't disagree violently with our hopes for the search terms appearing in many but not all relevant documents. Combining this method with our earlier approximation for , the document ranking is determined simply by which query terms occur in documents scaled by their idf weighting. For short documents (titles or abstracts) in situations in which iterative searching is undesirable, using this weighting term alone can be quite satisfactory, although in many other circumstances we would like to do better. Greiff (1998) argues that the constant estimate of in the Croft and Harper (1979) model is theoretically problematic and not observed empirically: as might be expected, is shown to rise with . Based on his data analysis, a plausible proposal would be to use the estimate . Iterative methods of estimation, which combine some of the above ideas, are discussed in the next subsection.

   Probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback We can use (pseudo-)relevance feedback, perhaps in an iterative process of estimation, to get a more accurate estimate of . The probabilistic approach to relevance feedback works as follows: Guess initial estimates of and . This can be done using the probability estimates of the previous section. For instance, we can assume that is constant over all in the query, in particular, perhaps taking . Use the current estimates of and to determine a best guess at the set of relevant documents . Use this model to retrieve a set of candidate relevant documents, which we present to the user. We interact with the user to refine the model of . We do this by learning from the user relevance judgments for some subset of documents . Based on relevance judgments, is partitioned into two subsets: and , which is disjoint from . We reestimate and on the basis of known relevant and nonrelevant documents. If the sets and are large enough, we may be able to estimate these quantities directly from these documents as maximum likelihood estimates: (77) (where is the set of documents in containing ). In practice, we usually need to smooth these estimates. We can do this by adding to both the count and to the number of relevant documents not containing the term, giving: (78) However, the set of documents judged by the user () is usually very small, and so the resulting statistical estimate is quite unreliable (noisy), even if the estimate is smoothed. So it is often better to combine the new information with the original guess in a process of Bayesian updating . In this case we have: (79) Here is the estimate for in an iterative updating process and is used as a Bayesian prior in the next iteration with a weighting of . Relating this equation back to Equation 59 requires a bit more probability theory than we have presented here (we need to use a beta distribution prior, conjugate to the Bernoulli random variable ). But the form of the resulting equation is quite straightforward: rather than uniformly distributing pseudocounts, we now distribute a total of pseudocounts according to the previous estimate, which acts as the prior distribution. In the absence of other evidence (and assuming that the user is perhaps indicating roughly 5 relevant or nonrelevant documents) then a value of around is perhaps appropriate. That is, the prior is strongly weighted so that the estimate does not change too much from the evidence provided by a very small number of documents. Repeat the above process from step 2, generating a succession of approximations to and hence , until the user is satisfied. It is also straightforward to derive a pseudo-relevance feedback version of this algorithm, where we simply pretend that . More briefly: Assume initial estimates for and as above. Determine a guess for the size of the relevant document set. If unsure, a conservative (too small) guess is likely to be best. This motivates use of a fixed size set of highest ranked documents. Improve our guesses for and . We choose from the methods of and 79 for re-estimating , except now based on the set instead of . If we let be the subset of documents in containing and use add smoothing , we get: (80) and if we assume that documents that are not retrieved are nonrelevant then we can update our estimates as: (81) Go to step 2 until the ranking of the returned results converges. Once we have a real estimate for then the weights used in the value look almost like a tf-idf value. For instance, using Equation 73, Equation 76, and Equation 80, we have: (82)     (83)  adding Exercises. Work through the derivation of Equation 74 from and 3()I .

  <TEXT>
   An appraisal of probabilistic models Probabilistic methods are one of the oldest formal models in IR. Already in the 1970s they were held out as an opportunity to place IR on a firmer theoretical footing, and with the resurgence of probabilistic methods in computational linguistics in the 1990s, that hope has returned, and probabilistic methods are again one of the currently hottest topics in IR. Traditionally, probabilistic IR has had neat ideas but the methods have never won on performance. Getting reasonable approximations of the needed probabilities for a probabilistic IR model is possible, but it requires some major assumptions. In the BIM these are: a Boolean representation of documents/queries/relevance term independence terms not in the query don't affect the outcome document relevance values are independent Things started to change in the 1990s when the BM25 weighting scheme, which we discuss in the next section, showed very good performance, and started to be adopted as a term weighting scheme by many groups. The difference between ``vector space'' and ``probabilistic'' IR systems is not that great: in either case, you build an information retrieval scheme in the exact same way that we discussed in Chapter 7 . For a probabilistic IR system, it's just that, at the end, you score queries not by cosine similarity and tf-idf in a vector space, but by a slightly different formula motivated by probability theory. Indeed, sometimes people have changed an existing vector-space IR system into an effectively probabilistic system simply by adopted term weighting formulas from probabilistic models. In this section, we briefly present three extensions of the traditional probabilistic model, and in the next chapter, we look at the somewhat different probabilistic language modeling approach to IR.

  <TITLE>11.4.2 Tree-structured dependencies between terms</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Tree-structured dependencies between terms   Some of the assumptions of the BIM can be removed. For example, we can remove the assumption that terms are independent. This assumption is very far from true in practice. A case that particularly violates this assumption is term pairs like Hong and Kong, which are strongly dependent. But dependencies can occur in various complex configurations, such as between the set of terms New, York, England, City, Stock, Exchange, and University. van Rijsbergen (1979) proposed a simple, plausible model which allowed a tree structure of term dependencies, as in Figure 11.1 . In this model each term can be directly dependent on only one other term, giving a tree structure of dependencies. When it was invented in the 1970s, estimation problems held back the practical success of this model, but the idea was reinvented as the Tree Augmented Naive Bayes model by Friedman and Goldszmidt (1996), who used it with some success on various machine learning data sets.

  <TITLE>11.4.3 Okapi BM25: a non-binary model</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Okapi BM25: a non-binary model The BIM was originally designed for short catalog records and abstracts of fairly consistent length, and it works reasonably in these contexts, but for modern full-text search collections, it seems clear that a model should pay attention to term frequency and document length, as in Chapter 6 . The BM25 weighting scheme , often called Okapi weighting , after the system in which it was first implemented, was developed as a way of building a probabilistic model sensitive to these quantities while not introducing too many additional parameters into the model (Spärck Jones et al., 2000). We will not develop the full theory behind the model here, but just present a series of forms that build up to the standard form now used for document scoring. The simplest score for document is just idf weighting of the query terms present, as in Equation 76: (84)   idf 75    (85)  We can improve on Equation 84 by factoring in the frequency of each term and document length: (86)               If the query is long, then we might also use similar weighting for query terms. This is appropriate if the queries are paragraph long information needs, but unnecessary for short queries. (87)       8.1    If we have relevance judgments available, then we can use the full form of smoothed-rf in place of the approximation introduced in prob-idf: (88)     (89)      11.3.4 Rather than just providing a term weighting method for terms in a user's query, relevance feedback can also involve augmenting the query (automatically or with manual review) with some (say, 10-20) of the top terms in the known-relevant documents as ordered by the relevance factor from Equation 75, and the above formula can then be used with such an augmented query vector . The BM25 term weighting formulas have been used quite widely and quite successfully across a range of collections and search tasks. Especially in the TREC evaluations, they performed well and were widely adopted by many groups. See Spärck Jones et al. (2000) for extensive motivation and discussion of experimental results.

  <TITLE>11.4.4 Bayesian network approaches to IR</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Bayesian network approaches to IR Turtle and Croft (1989;1991) introduced into information retrieval the use of Bayesian networks (Jensen and Jensen, 2001), a form of probabilistic graphical model. We skip the details because fully introducing the formalism of Bayesian networks would require much too much space, but conceptually, Bayesian networks use directed graphs to show probabilistic dependencies between variables, as in Figure 11.1 , and have led to the development of sophisticated algorithms for propagating influence so as to allow learning and inference with arbitrary knowledge within arbitrary directed acyclic graphs. Turtle and Croft used a sophisticated network to better model the complex dependencies between a document and a user's information need. The model decomposes into two parts: a document collection network and a query network. The document collection network is large, but can be precomputed: it maps from documents to terms to concepts. The concepts are a thesaurus-based expansion of the terms appearing in the document. The query network is relatively small but a new network needs to be built each time a query comes in, and then attached to the document network. The query network maps from query terms, to query subexpressions (built using probabilistic or ``noisy'' versions of AND and OR operators), to the user's information need. The result is a flexible probabilistic network which can generalize various simpler Boolean and probabilistic models. Indeed, this is the primary case of a statistical ranked retrieval model that naturally supports structured query operators. The system allowed efficient large-scale retrieval, and was the basis of the InQuery text retrieval system, built at the University of Massachusetts. This system performed very well in TREC evaluations and for a time was sold commercially. On the other hand, the model still used various approximations and independence assumptions to make parameter estimation and computation possible. There has not been much follow-on work along these lines, but we would note that this model was actually built very early on in the modern era of using Bayesian networks, and there have been many subsequent developments in the theory, and the time is perhaps right for a new generation of Bayesian network-based information retrieval systems.

   References and further reading Longer introductions to probability theory can be found in most introductory probability and statistics books, such as (Ross, 2006, Grinstead and Snell, 1997, Rice, 2006). An introduction to Bayesian utility theory can be found in (Ripley, 1996). The probabilistic approach to IR originated in the UK in the 1950s. The first major presentation of a probabilistic model is Maron and Kuhns (1960). Robertson and Jones (1976) introduce the main foundations of the BIM and van Rijsbergen (1979) presents in detail the classic BIM probabilistic model. The idea of the PRP is variously attributed to S. E. Robertson, M. E. Maron and W. S. Cooper (the term ``Probabilistic Ordering Principle'' is used in Robertson and Jones (1976), but PRP dominates in later work). Fuhr (1992) is a more recent presentation of probabilistic IR, which includes coverage of other approaches such as probabilistic logics and Bayesian networks. Crestani et al. (1998) is another survey. Spärck Jones et al. (2000) is the definitive presentation of probabilistic IR experiments by the ``London school'', and Robertson (2005) presents a retrospective on the group's participation in TREC evaluations, including detailed discussion of the Okapi BM25 scoring function and its development. Robertson et al. (2004) extend BM25 to the case of multiple weighted fields. The open-source Indri search engine, which is distributed with the Lemur toolkit (http://www.lemurproject.org/) merges ideas from Bayesian inference networks and statistical language modeling approaches (see Chapter 12 ), in particular preserving the former's support for structured query operators.

  <TITLE>Chapter 12 Language models for information retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Language models for information retrieval A common suggestion to users for coming up with good queries is to think of words that would likely appear in a relevant document, and to use those words as the query. The language modeling approach to IR directly models that idea: a document is a good match to a query if the document model is likely to generate the query, which will in turn happen if the document contains the query words often. This approach thus provides a different realization of some of the basic ideas for document ranking which we saw in Section 6.2 (page ). Instead of overtly modeling the probability of relevance of a document to a query , as in the traditional probabilistic approach to IR (Chapter 11 ), the basic language modeling approach instead builds a probabilistic language model from each document , and ranks documents based on the probability of the model generating the query: . In this chapter, we first introduce the concept of language models (Section 12.1 ) and then describe the basic and most commonly used language modeling approach to IR, the Query Likelihood Model (Section 12.2 ). After some comparisons between the language modeling approach and other approaches to IR (Section 12.3 ), we finish by briefly describing various extensions to the language modeling approach (Section 12.4 ).

  <TITLE>12.1.1 Finite automata and language models</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Finite automata and language models   What do we mean by a document model generating a query? A traditional generative model of a language, of the kind familiar from formal language theory, can be used either to recognize or to generate strings. For example, the finite automaton shown in Figure 12.1 can generate strings that include the examples shown. The full set of strings that can be generated is called the language of the automaton.   If instead each node has a probability distribution over generating different terms, we have a language model. The notion of a language model is inherently probabilistic. A language model is a function that puts a probability measure over strings drawn from some vocabulary. That is, for a language model over an alphabet : (90)   12.2 Worked example. To find the probability of a word sequence, we just multiply the probabilities which the model gives to each word in the sequence, together with the probability of continuing or stopping after producing each word. For example, (91)     (92)   (93)   frog 90 STOP   likelihood ratio  12.1.3 End worked example.  Figure 12.3: Partial specification of two unigram language models. Worked example. Suppose, now, that we have two language models and , shown partially in Figure 12.3 . Each gives a probability estimate to a sequence of terms, as already illustrated in m1probability. The language model that gives the higher probability to the sequence of terms is more likely to have generated the term sequence. This time, we will omit STOP probabilities from our calculations. For the sequence shown, we get: and we see that . We present the formulas here in terms of products of probabilities, but, as is common in probabilistic applications, in practice it is usually best to work with sums of log probabilities (cf. page 13.2 ). End worked example.

  <TITLE>12.1.3 Multinomial distributions over words</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Multinomial distributions over words Under the unigram language model the order of words is irrelevant, and so such models are often called ``bag of words'' models, as discussed in Chapter 6 (page 6.2 ). Even though there is no conditioning on preceding context, this model nevertheless still gives the probability of a particular ordering of terms. However, any other ordering of this bag of terms will have the same probability. So, really, we have a multinomial distribution over words. So long as we stick to unigram models, the language model name and motivation could be viewed as historical rather than necessary. We could instead just refer to the model as a multinomial model. From this perspective, the equations presented above do not present the multinomial probability of a bag of words, since they do not sum over all possible orderings of those words, as is done by the multinomial coefficient (the first term on the right-hand side) in the standard presentation of a multinomial model: (97)     STOP 13.2  The fundamental problem in designing language models is that we do not know what exactly we should use as the model . However, we do generally have a sample of text that is representative of that model. This problem makes a lot of sense in the original, primary uses of language models. For example, in speech recognition, we have a training sample of (spoken) text. But we have to expect that, in the future, users will use different words and in different sequences, which we have never observed before, and so the model has to generalize beyond the observed data to allow unknown words and sequences. This interpretation is not so clear in the IR case, where a document is finite and usually fixed. The strategy we adopt in IR is as follows. We pretend that the document is only a representative sample of text drawn from a model distribution, treating it like a fine-grained topic. We then estimate a language model from this sample, and use that model to calculate the probability of observing any word sequence, and, finally, we rank documents according to their probability of generating the query. Exercises. Including stop probabilities in the calculation, what will the sum of the probability estimates of all strings in the language of length 1 be? Assume that you generate a word and then decide whether to stop or not (i.e., the null string is not part of the language). If the stop probability is omitted from calculations, what will the sum of the scores assigned to strings in the language of length 1 be? What is the likelihood ratio of the document according to and in m1m2compare? No explicit STOP probability appeared in m1m2compare. Assuming that the STOP probability of each model is 0.1, does this change the likelihood ratio of a document according to the two models? How might a language model be used in a spelling correction system? In particular, consider the case of context-sensitive spelling correction, and correcting incorrect usages of words, such as their in Are you their? (See Section 3.5 (page ) for pointers to some literature on this topic.)

  <TITLE>12.2.1 Using query likelihood language models in IR</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Using query likelihood language models in IR Language modeling is a quite general formal approach to IR, with many variant realizations. The original and basic method for using language models in IR is the query likelihood model . In it, we construct from each document in the collection a language model . Our goal is to rank documents by , where the probability of a document is interpreted as the likelihood that it is relevant to the query. Using Bayes rule (as introduced in probirsec), we have: (98)        The most common way to do this is using the multinomial unigram language model, which is equivalent to a multinomial Naive Bayes model (page 13.3 ), where the documents are the classes, each treated in the estimation as a separate ``language''. Under this model, we have that: (99)    For retrieval based on a language model (henceforth LM ), we treat the generation of queries as a random process. The approach is to Infer a LM for each document. Estimate , the probability of generating the query according to each of these document models. Rank the documents according to these probabilities.

  <TITLE>12.2.2 Estimating the query generation probability</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Estimating the query generation probability In this section we describe how to estimate . The probability of producing the query given the LM of document using maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) and the unigram assumption is: (100)          11.3.2  The classic problem with using language models is one of estimation (the symbol on the P's is used above to stress that the model is estimated): terms appear very sparsely in documents. In particular, some words will not have appeared in the document at all, but are possible words for the information need, which the user may have used in the query. If we estimate for a term missing from a document , then we get a strict conjunctive semantics: documents will only give a query non-zero probability if all of the query terms appear in the document. Zero probabilities are clearly a problem in other uses of language models, such as when predicting the next word in a speech recognition application, because many words will be sparsely represented in the training data. It may seem rather less clear whether this is problematic in an IR application. This could be thought of as a human-computer interface issue: vector space systems have generally preferred more lenient matching, though recent web search developments have tended more in the direction of doing searches with such conjunctive semantics. Regardless of the approach here, there is a more general problem of estimation: occurring words are also badly estimated; in particular, the probability of words occurring once in the document is normally overestimated, since their one occurrence was partly by chance. The answer to this (as we saw in probtheory) is smoothing. But as people have come to understand the LM approach better, it has become apparent that the role of smoothing in this model is not only to avoid zero probabilities. The smoothing of terms actually implements major parts of the term weighting component (Exercise 12.2.3 ). It is not just that an unsmoothed model has conjunctive semantics; an unsmoothed model works badly because it lacks parts of the term weighting component. Thus, we need to smooth probabilities in our document language models: to discount non-zero probabilities and to give some probability mass to unseen words. There's a wide space of approaches to smoothing probability distributions to deal with this problem. In Section 11.3.2 (page ), we already discussed adding a number (1, 1/2, or a small ) to the observed counts and renormalizing to give a probability distribution.In this section we will mention a couple of other smoothing methods, which involve combining observed counts with a more general reference probability distribution. The general approach is that a non-occurring term should be possible in a query, but its probability should be somewhat close to but no more likely than would be expected by chance from the whole collection. That is, if then (101)     (102)     linear interpolation   An alternative is to use a language model built from the whole collection as a prior distribution in a Bayesian updating process (rather than a uniform distribution, as we saw in Section 11.3.2 ). We then get the following equation: (103)  Both of these smoothing methods have been shown to perform well in IR experiments; we will stick with the linear interpolation smoothing method for the rest of this section. While different in detail, they are both conceptually similar: in both cases the probability estimate for a word present in the document combines a discounted MLE and a fraction of the estimate of its prevalence in the whole collection, while for words not present in a document, the estimate is just a fraction of the estimate of the prevalence of the word in the whole collection. The role of smoothing in LMs for IR is not simply or principally to avoid estimation problems. This was not clear when the models were first proposed, but it is now understood that smoothing is essential to the good properties of the models. The reason for this is explored in Exercise 12.2.3 . The extent of smoothing in these two models is controlled by the and parameters: a small value of or a large value of means more smoothing. This parameter can be tuned to optimize performance using a line search (or, for the linear interpolation model, by other methods, such as the expectation maximimization algorithm; see modelclustering). The value need not be a constant. One approach is to make the value a function of the query size. This is useful because a small amount of smoothing (a ``conjunctive-like'' search) is more suitable for short queries, while a lot of smoothing is more suitable for long queries. To summarize, the retrieval ranking for a query under the basic LM for IR we have been considering is given by: (104)   Worked example. Suppose the document collection contains two documents: : Xyzzy reports a profit but revenue is down : Quorus narrows quarter loss but revenue decreases further  Suppose the query is revenue down. Then: (105)   (106) (107)   (108)    End worked example.

  <TITLE>12.2.3 Ponte and Croft's Experiments</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Ponte and Croft's Experiments   Ponte and Croft (1998) present the first experiments on the language modeling approach to information retrieval. Their basic approach is the model that we have presented until now. However, we have presented an approach where the language model is a mixture of two multinomials, much as in (Miller et al., 1999, Hiemstra, 2000) rather than Ponte and Croft's multivariate Bernoulli model. The use of multinomials has been standard in most subsequent work in the LM approach and experimental results in IR, as well as evidence from text classification which we consider in Section 13.3 (page ), suggests that it is superior. Ponte and Croft argued strongly for the effectiveness of the term weights that come from the language modeling approach over traditional tf-idf weights. We present a subset of their results in Figure 12.4 where they compare tf-idf to language modeling by evaluating TREC topics 202-250 over TREC disks 2 and 3. The queries are sentence-length natural language queries. The language modeling approach yields significantly better results than their baseline tf-idf based term weighting approach. And indeed the gains shown here have been extended in subsequent work. Exercises. Consider making a language model from the following training text: the martian has landed on the latin pop sensation ricky martin Under a MLE-estimated unigram probability model, what are and ? Under a MLE-estimated bigram model, what are and ? Suppose we have a collection that consists of the 4 documents given in the below table. docID Document text 1 click go the shears boys click click click 2 click click 3 metal here 4 metal shears click here Build a query likelihood language model for this document collection. Assume a mixture model between the documents and the collection, with both weighted at 0.5. Maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is used to estimate both as unigram models. Work out the model probabilities of the queries click, shears, and hence click shears for each document, and use those probabilities to rank the documents returned by each query. Fill in these probabilities in the below table: Query Doc 1 Doc 2 Doc 3 Doc 4 click         shears         click shears         What is the final ranking of the documents for the query click shears? Using the calculations in Exercise 12.2.3 as inspiration or as examples where appropriate, write one sentence each describing the treatment that the model in Equation 102 gives to each of the following quantities. Include whether it is present in the model or not and whether the effect is raw or scaled. Term frequency in a document Collection frequency of a term Document frequency of a term Length normalization of a term In the mixture model approach to the query likelihood model (Equation 104), the probability estimate of a term is based on the term frequency of a word in a document, and the collection frequency of the word. Doing this certainly guarantees that each term of a query (in the vocabulary) has a non-zero chance of being generated by each document. But it has a more subtle but important effect of implementing a form of term weighting, related to what we saw in Chapter 6 . Explain how this works. In particular, include in your answer a concrete numeric example showing this term weighting at work.

  <TITLE>12.3 Language modeling versus other approaches in IR</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Language modeling versus other approaches in IR The language modeling approach provides a novel way of looking at the problem of text retrieval, which links it with a lot of recent work in speech and language processing. As Ponte and Croft (1998) emphasize, the language modeling approach to IR provides a different approach to scoring matches between queries and documents, and the hope is that the probabilistic language modeling foundation improves the weights that are used, and hence the performance of the model. The major issue is estimation of the document model, such as choices of how to smooth it effectively. The model has achieved very good retrieval results. Compared to other probabilistic approaches, such as the BIM from Chapter 11 , the main difference initially appears to be that the LM approach does away with explicitly modeling relevance (whereas this is the central variable evaluated in the BIM approach). But this may not be the correct way to think about things, as some of the papers in Section 12.5 further discuss. The LM approach assumes that documents and expressions of information needs are objects of the same type, and assesses their match by importing the tools and methods of language modeling from speech and natural language processing. The resulting model is mathematically precise, conceptually simple, computationally tractable, and intuitively appealing. This seems similar to the situation with XML retrieval (Chapter 10 ): there the approaches that assume queries and documents are objects of the same type are also among the most successful. On the other hand, like all IR models, you can also raise objections to the model. The assumption of equivalence between document and information need representation is unrealistic. Current LM approaches use very simple models of language, usually unigram models. Without an explicit notion of relevance, relevance feedback is difficult to integrate into the model, as are user preferences. It also seems necessary to move beyond a unigram model to accommodate notions of phrase or passage matching or Boolean retrieval operators. Subsequent work in the LM approach has looked at addressing some of these concerns, including putting relevance back into the model and allowing a language mismatch between the query language and the document language. The model has significant relations to traditional tf-idf models. Term frequency is directly represented in tf-idf models, and much recent work has recognized the importance of document length normalization. The effect of doing a mixture of document generation probability with collection generation probability is a little like idf: terms rare in the general collection but common in some documents will have a greater influence on the ranking of documents. In most concrete realizations, the models share treating terms as if they were independent. On the other hand, the intuitions are probabilistic rather than geometric, the mathematical models are more principled rather than heuristic, and the details of how statistics like term frequency and document length are used differ. If you are concerned mainly with performance numbers, recent work has shown the LM approach to be very effective in retrieval experiments, beating tf-idf and BM25 weights. Nevertheless, there is perhaps still insufficient evidence that its performance so greatly exceeds that of a well-tuned traditional vector space retrieval system as to justify changing an existing implementation.

  <TITLE>12.4 Extended language modeling approaches</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Extended language modeling approaches In this section we briefly mention some of the work that extends the basic language modeling approach. There are other ways to think of using the language modeling idea in IR settings, and many of them have been tried in subsequent work. Rather than looking at the probability of a document language model generating the query, you can look at the probability of a query language model generating the document. The main reason that doing things in this direction and creating a document likelihood model is less appealing is that there is much less text available to estimate a language model based on the query text, and so the model will be worse estimated, and will have to depend more on being smoothed with some other language model. On the other hand, it is easy to see how to incorporate relevance feedback into such a model: you can expand the query with terms taken from relevant documents in the usual way and hence update the language model (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001a). Indeed, with appropriate modeling choices, this approach leads to the BIM model of Chapter 11 . The relevance model of Lavrenko and Croft (2001) is an instance of a document likelihood model, which incorporates pseudo-relevance feedback into a language modeling approach. It achieves very strong empirical results.  Figure 12.5: Three ways of developing the language modeling approach: (a) query likelihood, (b) document likelihood, and (c) model comparison. Rather than directly generating in either direction, we can make a language model from both the document and query, and then ask how different these two language models are from each other. Lafferty and Zhai (2001) lay out these three ways of thinking about the problem, which we show in Figure 12.5 , and develop a general risk minimization approach for document retrieval. For instance, one way to model the risk of returning a document as relevant to a query is to use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their respective language models: (109)    Manning and Schütze, 1999 Cover and Thomas, 1991 Lafferty and Zhai (2001) Kraaij and Spitters (2003)  Basic LMs do not address issues of alternate expression, that is, synonymy, or any deviation in use of language between queries and documents. Berger and Lafferty (1999) introduce translation models to bridge this query-document gap. A translation model lets you generate query words not in a document by translation to alternate terms with similar meaning. This also provides a basis for performing cross-language IR. We assume that the translation model can be represented by a conditional probability distribution between vocabulary terms. The form of the translation query generation model is then: (110)    Building extended LM approaches remains an active area of research. In general, translation models, relevance feedback models, and model comparison approaches have all been demonstrated to improve performance over the basic query likelihood LM.

   References and further reading For more details on the basic concepts of probabilistic language models and techniques for smoothing, see either Manning and Schütze (1999, Chapter 6) or Jurafsky and Martin (2008, Chapter 4). The important initial papers that originated the language modeling approach to IR are: (Berger and Lafferty, 1999, Ponte and Croft, 1998, Miller et al., 1999, Hiemstra, 1998). Other relevant papers can be found in the next several years of SIGIR proceedings. (Croft and Lafferty, 2003) contains a collection of papers from a workshop on language modeling approaches and Hiemstra and Kraaij (2005) review one prominent thread of work on using language modeling approaches for TREC tasks. Zhai and Lafferty (2001b) clarify the role of smoothing in LMs for IR and present detailed empirical comparisons of different smoothing methods. Zaragoza et al. (2003) advocate using full Bayesian predictive distributions rather than MAP point estimates, but while they outperform Bayesian smoothing, they fail to outperform a linear interpolation. Zhai and Lafferty (2002) argue that a two-stage smoothing model with first Bayesian smoothing followed by linear interpolation gives a good model of the task, and performs better and more stably than a single form of smoothing. A nice feature of the LM approach is that it provides a convenient and principled way to put various kinds of prior information into the model; Kraaij et al. (2002) demonstrate this by showing the value of link information as a prior in improving web entry page retrieval performance. As briefly discussed in Chapter 16 (page 16.1 ), Liu and Croft (2004) show some gains by smoothing a document LM with estimates from a cluster of similar documents; Tao et al. (2006) report larger gains by doing document-similarity based smoothing. Hiemstra and Kraaij (2005) present TREC results showing a LM approach beating use of BM25 weights. Recent work has achieved some gains by going beyond the unigram model, providing the higher order models are smoothed with lower order models (Cao et al., 2005, Gao et al., 2004), though the gains to date remain modest. Spärck Jones (2004) presents a critical viewpoint on the rationale for the language modeling approach, but Lafferty and Zhai (2003) argue that a unified account can be given of the probabilistic semantics underlying both the language modeling approach presented in this chapter and the classical probabilistic information retrieval approach of Chapter 11 . The Lemur Toolkit (http://www.lemurproject.org/) provides a flexible open source framework for investigating language modeling approaches to IR.

  <TITLE>Chapter 13 Text classification and Naive Bayes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Text classification and Naive Bayes Thus far, this book has mainly discussed the process of ad hoc retrieval , where users have transient information needs that they try to address by posing one or more queries to a search engine. However, many users have ongoing information needs. For example, you might need to track developments in multicore computer chips. One way of doing this is to issue the query multicore and computer and chip against an index of recent newswire articles each morning. In this and the following two chapters we examine the question: How can this repetitive task be automated? To this end, many systems support standing queries . A standing query is like any other query except that it is periodically executed on a collection to which new documents are incrementally added over time. If your standing query is just multicore and computer and chip, you will tend to miss many relevant new articles which use other terms such as multicore processors. To achieve good recall, standing queries thus have to be refined over time and can gradually become quite complex. In this example, using a Boolean search engine with stemming, you might end up with a query like (multicore or multi-core) and (chip or processor or microprocessor). To capture the generality and scope of the problem space to which standing queries belong, we now introduce the general notion of a classification problem. Given a set of classes, we seek to determine which class(es) a given object belongs to. In the example, the standing query serves to divide new newswire articles into the two classes: documents about multicore computer chips and documents not about multicore computer chips. We refer to this as two-class classification. Classification using standing queries is also called routing or filtering and will be discussed further in Section 15.3.1 (page ). A class need not be as narrowly focused as the standing query multicore computer chips. Often, a class is a more general subject area like China or coffee. Such more general classes are usually referred to as topics , and the classification task is then called text classification , text categorization , topic classification , or topic spotting . An example for China appears in Figure 13.1 . Standing queries and topics differ in their degree of specificity, but the methods for solving routing, filtering, and text classification are essentially the same. We therefore include routing and filtering under the rubric of text classification in this and the following chapters. The notion of classification is very general and has many applications within and beyond information retrieval (IR). For instance, in computer vision, a classifier may be used to divide images into classes such as landscape, portrait, and neither. We focus here on examples from information retrieval such as:  Several of the preprocessing steps necessary for indexing as discussed in Chapter 2 : detecting a document's encoding (ASCII, Unicode UTF-8 etc; page 2.1.1 ); word segmentation (Is the white space between two letters a word boundary or not? page 24 ) ; truecasing (page 2.2.3 ); and identifying the language of a document (page 2.5 ). The automatic detection of spam pages (which then are not included in the search engine index). The automatic detection of sexually explicit content (which is included in search results only if the user turns an option such as SafeSearch off). Sentiment detection or the automatic classification of a movie or product review as positive or negative. An example application is a user searching for negative reviews before buying a camera to make sure it has no undesirable features or quality problems. Personal email sorting . A user may have folders like talk announcements, electronic bills, email from family and friends, and so on, and may want a classifier to classify each incoming email and automatically move it to the appropriate folder. It is easier to find messages in sorted folders than in a very large inbox. The most common case of this application is a spam folder that holds all suspected spam messages. Topic-specific or vertical search. Vertical search engines restrict searches to a particular topic. For example, the query computer science on a vertical search engine for the topic China will return a list of Chinese computer science departments with higher precision and recall than the query computer science China on a general purpose search engine. This is because the vertical search engine does not include web pages in its index that contain the term china in a different sense (e.g., referring to a hard white ceramic), but does include relevant pages even if they do not explicitly mention the term China. Finally, the ranking function in ad hoc information retrieval can also be based on a document classifier as we will explain in Section 15.4 (page ). This list shows the general importance of classification in IR. Most retrieval systems today contain multiple components that use some form of classifier. The classification task we will use as an example in this book is text classification. A computer is not essential for classification. Many classification tasks have traditionally been solved manually. Books in a library are assigned Library of Congress categories by a librarian. But manual classification is expensive to scale. The multicore computer chips example illustrates one alternative approach: classification by the use of standing queries - which can be thought of as rules - most commonly written by hand. As in our example (multicore or multi-core) and (chip or processor or microprocessor), rules are sometimes equivalent to Boolean expressions. A rule captures a certain combination of keywords that indicates a class. Hand-coded rules have good scaling properties, but creating and maintaining them over time is labor intensive. A technically skilled person (e.g., a domain expert who is good at writing regular expressions) can create rule sets that will rival or exceed the accuracy of the automatically generated classifiers we will discuss shortly; however, it can be hard to find someone with this specialized skill. Apart from manual classification and hand-crafted rules, there is a third approach to text classification, namely, machine learning-based text classification. It is the approach that we focus on in the next several chapters. In machine learning, the set of rules or, more generally, the decision criterion of the text classifier, is learned automatically from training data. This approach is also called statistical text classification if the learning method is statistical. In statistical text classification, we require a number of good example documents (or training documents) for each class. The need for manual classification is not eliminated because the training documents come from a person who has labeled them - where labeling refers to the process of annotating each document with its class. But labeling is arguably an easier task than writing rules. Almost anybody can look at a document and decide whether or not it is related to China. Sometimes such labeling is already implicitly part of an existing workflow. For instance, you may go through the news articles returned by a standing query each morning and give relevance feedback (cf. Chapter 9 ) by moving the relevant articles to a special folder like multicore-processors. We begin this chapter with a general introduction to the text classification problem including a formal definition (Section 13.1 ); we then cover Naive Bayes, a particularly simple and effective classification method (Sections 13.2-13.4). All of the classification algorithms we study represent documents in high-dimensional spaces. To improve the efficiency of these algorithms, it is generally desirable to reduce the dimensionality of these spaces; to this end, a technique known as feature selection is commonly applied in text classification as discussed in Section 13.5 . Section 13.6 covers evaluation of text classification. In the following chapters, Chapters 14 15 , we look at two other families of classification methods, vector space classifiers and support vector machines.

  <TITLE>13.1 The text classification problem</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The text classification problem In text classification, we are given a description of a document, where is the document space ; and a fixed set of classes . Classes are also called categories or labels . Typically, the document space is some type of high-dimensional space, and the classes are human defined for the needs of an application, as in the examples China and documents that talk about multicore computer chips above. We are given a training set of labeled documents , where . For example: (111)  Using a learning method or learning algorithm , we then wish to learn a classifier or classification function that maps documents to classes:  (112)  This type of learning is called supervised learning because a supervisor (the human who defines the classes and labels training documents) serves as a teacher directing the learning process. We denote the supervised learning method by and write . The learning method takes the training set as input and returns the learned classification function . Most names for learning methods are also used for classifiers . We talk about the Naive Bayes (NB) learning method when we say that ``Naive Bayes is robust,'' meaning that it can be applied to many different learning problems and is unlikely to produce classifiers that fail catastrophically. But when we say that ``Naive Bayes had an error rate of 20%,'' we are describing an experiment in which a particular NB classifier (which was produced by the NB learning method) had a 20% error rate in an application. Figure 13.1 shows an example of text classification from the Reuters-RCV1 collection, introduced in Section 4.2 , page 4.2 . There are six classes (UK, China, ..., sports), each with three training documents. We show a few mnemonic words for each document's content. The training set provides some typical examples for each class, so that we can learn the classification function . Once we have learned , we can apply it to the test set (or test data ), for example, the new document first private Chinese airline whose class is unknown. In Figure 13.1 , the classification function assigns the new document to class China, which is the correct assignment. The classes in text classification often have some interesting structure such as the hierarchy in Figure 13.1 . There are two instances each of region categories, industry categories, and subject area categories. A hierarchy can be an important aid in solving a classification problem; see Section 15.3.2 for further discussion. Until then, we will make the assumption in the text classification chapters that the classes form a set with no subset relationships between them.  Figure 13.1: Classes, training set, and test set in text classification . Definition eqn:gammadef stipulates that a document is a member of exactly one class. This is not the most appropriate model for the hierarchy in Figure 13.1 . For instance, a document about the 2008 Olympics should be a member of two classes: the China class and the sports class. This type of classification problem is referred to as an any-of problem and we will return to it in Section 14.5 (page ). For the time being, we only consider one-of problems where a document is a member of exactly one class. Our goal in text classification is high accuracy on test data or new data - for example, the newswire articles that we will encounter tomorrow morning in the multicore chip example. It is easy to achieve high accuracy on the training set (e.g., we can simply memorize the labels). But high accuracy on the training set in general does not mean that the classifier will work well on new data in an application. When we use the training set to learn a classifier for test data, we make the assumption that training data and test data are similar or from the same distribution. We defer a precise definition of this notion to Section 14.6 (page ).

   Naive Bayes text classification  multinomial Naive Bayes  multinomial NB        (113)                   In text classification, our goal is to find the best class for the document. The best class in NB classification is the most likely or maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) class : (114)      In Equation 114, many conditional probabilities are multiplied, one for each position . This can result in a floating point underflow. It is therefore better to perform the computation by adding logarithms of probabilities instead of multiplying probabilities. The class with the highest log probability score is still the most probable; and the logarithm function is monotonic. Hence, the maximization that is actually done in most implementations of NB is:     (115)   Equation 115 has a simple interpretation. Each conditional parameter is a weight that indicates how good an indicator is for . Similarly, the prior is a weight that indicates the relative frequency of . More frequent classes are more likely to be the correct class than infrequent classes. The sum of log prior and term weights is then a measure of how much evidence there is for the document being in the class, and Equation 115 selects the class for which we have the most evidence. We will initially work with this intuitive interpretation of the multinomial NB model and defer a formal derivation to Section 13.4 . How do we estimate the parameters and ? We first try the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE; probtheory), which is simply the relative frequency and corresponds to the most likely value of each parameter given the training data. For the priors this estimate is:     (116)       We estimate the conditional probability as the relative frequency of term in documents belonging to class : (117)      positional independence assumption      The problem with the MLE estimate is that it is zero for a term-class combination that did not occur in the training data. If the term WTO in the training data only occurred in China documents, then the MLE estimates for the other classes, for example UK, will be zero: (118)  113    sparseness  Figure 13.2: Naive Bayes algorithm (multinomial model): Training and testing. To eliminate zeros, we use add-one or Laplace smoothing, which simply adds one to each count (cf. Section 11.3.2 ): (119)   term class 116 We have now introduced all the elements we need for training and applying an NB classifier.

Finally, assuming that the length of test documents is bounded, because for a fixed constant . Table 13.2 summarizes the time complexities. In general, we have , so both training and testing complexity are linear in the time it takes to scan the data. Because we have to look at the data at least once, NB can be said to have optimal time complexity. Its efficiency is one reason why NB is a popular text classification method.

  <TITLE>13.3 The Bernoulli model</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The Bernoulli model There are two different ways we can set up an NB classifier. The model we introduced in the previous section is the multinomial model . It generates one term from the vocabulary in each position of the document, where we assume a generative model that will be discussed in more detail in Section 13.4 (see also page 12.1.1 ). An alternative to the multinomial model is the multivariate Bernoulli model or Bernoulli model . It is equivalent to the binary independence model of Section 11.3 (page ), which generates an indicator for each term of the vocabulary, either indicating presence of the term in the document or indicating absence. Figure 13.3 presents training and testing algorithms for the Bernoulli model. The Bernoulli model has the same time complexity as the multinomial model.   The different generation models imply different estimation strategies and different classification rules. The Bernoulli model estimates as the fraction of documents of class that contain term (Figure 13.3 , TRAINBERNOULLINB, line 8). In contrast, the multinomial model estimates as the fraction of tokens or fraction of positions in documents of class that contain term (Equation 119). When classifying a test document, the Bernoulli model uses binary occurrence information, ignoring the number of occurrences, whereas the multinomial model keeps track of multiple occurrences. As a result, the Bernoulli model typically makes many mistakes when classifying long documents. For example, it may assign an entire book to the class China because of a single occurrence of the term China. The models also differ in how nonoccurring terms are used in classification. They do not affect the classification decision in the multinomial model; but in the Bernoulli model the probability of nonoccurrence is factored in when computing (Figure 13.3 , APPLYBERNOULLINB, Line 7). This is because only the Bernoulli NB model models absence of terms explicitly. Worked example. Applying the Bernoulli model to the example in Table 13.1 , we have the same estimates for the priors as before: , . The conditional probabilities are:      The denominators are and because there are three documents in and one document in and because the constant in Equation 119 is 2 - there are two cases to consider for each term, occurrence and nonoccurrence. The scores of the test document for the two classes are               End worked example.

  <TITLE>13.4 Properties of Naive Bayes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Properties of Naive Bayes 11 12   (121)   (122)   (123)   59 59 122  We can interpret Equation 123 as a description of the generative process we assume in Bayesian text classification. To generate a document, we first choose class with probability (top nodes in and 13.5 ). The two models differ in the formalization of the second step, the generation of the document given the class, corresponding to the conditional distribution : (124) (125)        It should now be clearer why we introduced the document space in Equation 112 when we defined the classification problem. A critical step in solving a text classification problem is to choose the document representation. and are two different document representations. In the first case, is the set of all term sequences (or, more precisely, sequences of term tokens). In the second case, is . We cannot use and 125 for text classification directly. For the Bernoulli model, we would have to estimate different parameters, one for each possible combination of values and a class. The number of parameters in the multinomial case has the same order of magnitude.This being a very large quantity, estimating these parameters reliably is infeasible. To reduce the number of parameters, we make the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption . We assume that attribute values are independent of each other given the class: (126) (127)                    Figure 13.4: The multinomial NB model.  Figure 13.5: The Bernoulli NB model. We illustrate the conditional independence assumption in and 13.5 . The class China generates values for each of the five term attributes (multinomial) or six binary attributes (Bernoulli) with a certain probability, independent of the values of the other attributes. The fact that a document in the class China contains the term Taipei does not make it more likely or less likely that it also contains Beijing. In reality, the conditional independence assumption does not hold for text data. Terms are conditionally dependent on each other. But as we will discuss shortly, NB models perform well despite the conditional independence assumption. Even when assuming conditional independence, we still have too many parameters for the multinomial model if we assume a different probability distribution for each position in the document. The position of a term in a document by itself does not carry information about the class. Although there is a difference between China sues France and France sues China, the occurrence of China in position 1 versus position 3 of the document is not useful in NB classification because we look at each term separately. The conditional independence assumption commits us to this way of processing the evidence. Also, if we assumed different term distributions for each position , we would have to estimate a different set of parameters for each . The probability of bean appearing as the first term of a coffee document could be different from it appearing as the second term, and so on. This again causes problems in estimation owing to data sparseness. For these reasons, we make a second independence assumption for the multinomial model, positional independence : The conditional probabilities for a term are the same independent of position in the document. (128)         bag of words 6 6.2 With conditional and positional independence assumptions, we only need to estimate parameters (multinomial model) or (Bernoulli model), one for each term-class combination, rather than a number that is at least exponential in , the size of the vocabulary. The independence assumptions reduce the number of parameters to be estimated by several orders of magnitude. To summarize, we generate a document in the multinomial model (Figure 13.4 ) by first picking a class with where is a random variable taking values from as values. Next we generate term in position with for each of the positions of the document. The all have the same distribution over terms for a given . In the example in Figure 13.4 , we show the generation of , corresponding to the one-sentence document Beijing and Taipei join WTO. For a completely specified document generation model, we would also have to define a distribution over lengths. Without it, the multinomial model is a token generation model rather than a document generation model. We generate a document in the Bernoulli model (Figure 13.5 ) by first picking a class with and then generating a binary indicator for each term of the vocabulary ( ). In the example in Figure 13.5 , we show the generation of , corresponding, again, to the one-sentence document Beijing and Taipei join WTO where we have assumed that and is a stop word.   Table 13.3: Multinomial versus Bernoulli model.     multinomial model Bernoulli model     event model generation of token generation of document     random variable(s) iff occurs at given pos iff occurs in doc     document representation                  parameter estimation     decision rule: maximize     multiple occurrences taken into account ignored     length of docs can handle longer docs works best for short docs     # features can handle more works best with fewer     estimate for term the    We compare the two models in Table 13.3 , including estimation equations and decision rules. Naive Bayes is so called because the independence assumptions we have just made are indeed very naive for a model of natural language. The conditional independence assumption states that features are independent of each other given the class. This is hardly ever true for terms in documents. In many cases, the opposite is true. The pairs hong and kong or london and english in Figure 13.7 are examples of highly dependent terms. In addition, the multinomial model makes an assumption of positional independence. The Bernoulli model ignores positions in documents altogether because it only cares about absence or presence. This bag-of-words model discards all information that is communicated by the order of words in natural language sentences. How can NB be a good text classifier when its model of natural language is so oversimplified?   Table 13.4: Correct estimation implies accurate prediction, but accurate prediction does not imply correct estimation.     class selected     true probability 0.6 0.4     (Equation 126) 0.00099 0.00001       NB estimate 0.99 0.01    The answer is that even though the probability estimates of NB are of low quality, its classification decisions are surprisingly good. Consider a document with true probabilities and as shown in Table 13.4 . Assume that contains many terms that are positive indicators for and many terms that are negative indicators for . Thus, when using the multinomial model in Equation 126, will be much larger than (0.00099 vs. 0.00001 in the table). After division by 0.001 to get well-formed probabilities for , we end up with one estimate that is close to 1.0 and one that is close to 0.0. This is common: The winning class in NB classification usually has a much larger probability than the other classes and the estimates diverge very significantly from the true probabilities. But the classification decision is based on which class gets the highest score. It does not matter how accurate the estimates are. Despite the bad estimates, NB estimates a higher probability for and therefore assigns to the correct class in Table 13.4 . Correct estimation implies accurate prediction, but accurate prediction does not imply correct estimation. NB classifiers estimate badly, but often classify well. Even if it is not the method with the highest accuracy for text, NB has many virtues that make it a strong contender for text classification. It excels if there are many equally important features that jointly contribute to the classification decision. It is also somewhat robust to noise features (as defined in the next section) and concept drift - the gradual change over time of the concept underlying a class like US president from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush (see Section 13.7 ). Classifiers like kNN knn can be carefully tuned to idiosyncratic properties of a particular time period. This will then hurt them when documents in the following time period have slightly different properties. The Bernoulli model is particularly robust with respect to concept drift. We will see in Figure 13.8 that it can have decent performance when using fewer than a dozen terms. The most important indicators for a class are less likely to change. Thus, a model that only relies on these features is more likely to maintain a certain level of accuracy in concept drift. NB's main strength is its efficiency: Training and classification can be accomplished with one pass over the data. Because it combines efficiency with good accuracy it is often used as a baseline in text classification research. It is often the method of choice if (i) squeezing out a few extra percentage points of accuracy is not worth the trouble in a text classification application, (ii) a very large amount of training data is available and there is more to be gained from training on a lot of data than using a better classifier on a smaller training set, or (iii) if its robustness to concept drift can be exploited.

We can view feature selection as a method for replacing a complex classifier (using all features) with a simpler one (using a subset of the features). It may appear counterintuitive at first that a seemingly weaker classifier is advantageous in statistical text classification, but when discussing the bias-variance tradeoff in Section 14.6 (page ), we will see that weaker models are often preferable when limited training data are available. The basic feature selection algorithm is shown in Figure 13.6 . For a given class , we compute a utility measure for each term of the vocabulary and select the terms that have the highest values of . All other terms are discarded and not used in classification. We will introduce three different utility measures in this section: mutual information, ; the test, ; and frequency, . Of the two NB models, the Bernoulli model is particularly sensitive to noise features. A Bernoulli NB classifier requires some form of feature selection or else its accuracy will be low. This section mainly addresses feature selection for two-class classification tasks like China versus not-China.

  <TITLE>13.5.1 Mutual information</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Mutual information A common feature selection method is to compute as the expected mutual information (MI) of term and class . MI measures how much information the presence/absence of a term contributes to making the correct classification decision on . Formally: (130)        13.4          For MLEs of the probabilities, Equation 130 is equivalent to Equation 131: (131)     (132)                130 131  Worked example. Consider the class poultry and the term export in Reuters-RCV1. The counts of the number of documents with the four possible combinations of indicator values are as follows:   131     End worked example. To select terms for a given class, we use the feature selection algorithm in Figure 13.6 : We compute the utility measure as and select the terms with the largest values. Mutual information measures how much information - in the information-theoretic sense - a term contains about the class. If a term's distribution is the same in the class as it is in the collection as a whole, then . MI reaches its maximum value if the term is a perfect indicator for class membership, that is, if the term is present in a document if and only if the document is in the class.  Figure 13.7: Features with high mutual information scores for six Reuters-RCV1 classes. Figure 13.7 shows terms with high mutual information scores for the six classes in Figure 13.1 . The selected terms (e.g., london, uk, british for the class UK) are of obvious utility for making classification decisions for their respective classes. At the bottom of the list for UK we find terms like peripherals and tonight (not shown in the figure) that are clearly not helpful in deciding whether the document is in the class. As you might expect, keeping the informative terms and eliminating the non-informative ones tends to reduce noise and improve the classifier's accuracy.

   Frequency-based feature selection  frequency-based feature selection       Frequency-based feature selection selects some frequent terms that have no specific information about the class, for example, the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...), which are frequent across classes in newswire text. When many thousands of features are selected, then frequency-based feature selection often does well. Thus, if somewhat suboptimal accuracy is acceptable, then frequency-based feature selection can be a good alternative to more complex methods. However, Figure 13.8 is a case where frequency-based feature selection performs a lot worse than MI and and should not be used.

   Feature selection for multiple classifiers     More commonly, feature selection statistics are first computed separately for each class on the two-class classification task versus and then combined. One combination method computes a single figure of merit for each feature, for example, by averaging the values for feature , and then selects the features with highest figures of merit. Another frequently used combination method selects the top features for each of classifiers and then combines these sets into one global feature set. Classification accuracy often decreases when selecting common features for a system with classifiers as opposed to different sets of size .

  <TEXT>
   Comparison of feature selection methods       Despite the differences between the two methods, the classification accuracy of feature sets selected with and MI does not seem to differ systematically. In most text classification problems, there are a few strong indicators and many weak indicators. As long as all strong indicators and a large number of weak indicators are selected, accuracy is expected to be good. Both methods do this. Figure 13.8 compares MI and feature selection for the multinomial model. Peak effectiveness is virtually the same for both methods. reaches this peak later, at 300 features, probably because the rare, but highly significant features it selects initially do not cover all documents in the class. However, features selected later (in the range of 100-300) are of better quality than those selected by MI. All three methods - MI, and frequency based - are greedy methods. They may select features that contribute no incremental information over previously selected features. In Figure 13.7 , kong is selected as the seventh term even though it is highly correlated with previously selected hong and therefore redundant. Although such redundancy can negatively impact accuracy, non-greedy methods (see Section 13.7 for references) are rarely used in text classification due to their computational cost. Exercises.

  <TITLE>13.6 Evaluation of text classification</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Evaluation of text classification Historically, the classic Reuters-21578 collection was the main benchmark for text classification evaluation. This is a collection of 21,578 newswire articles, originally collected and labeled by Carnegie Group, Inc. and Reuters, Ltd. in the course of developing the CONSTRUE text classification system. It is much smaller than and predates the Reuters-RCV1 collection discussed in Chapter 4 (page 4.2 ). The articles are assigned classes from a set of 118 topic categories. A document may be assigned several classes or none, but the commonest case is single assignment (documents with at least one class received an average of 1.24 classes). The standard approach to this any-of problem (Chapter 14 , page 14.5 ) is to learn 118 two-class classifiers, one for each class, where the two-class classifier for class is the classifier for the two classes and its complement .   Table 13.7: The ten largest classes in the Reuters-21578 collection with number of documents in training and test sets.   class # train # test   class # train # test     earn 2877 1087   trade 369 119     acquisitions 1650 179   interest 347 131     money-fx 538 179   ship 197 89     grain 433 149   wheat 212 71     crude 389 189   corn 182 56    For each of these classifiers, we can measure recall, precision, and accuracy. In recent work, people almost invariably use the ModApte split , which includes only documents that were viewed and assessed by a human indexer, and comprises 9,603 training documents and 3,299 test documents. The distribution of documents in classes is very uneven, and some work evaluates systems on only documents in the ten largest classes. They are listed in Table 13.7 . A typical document with topics is shown in Figure 13.9 . In Section 13.1 , we stated as our goal in text classification the minimization of classification error on test data. Classification error is 1.0 minus classification accuracy, the proportion of correct decisions, a measure we introduced in Section 8.3 (page 8.3 ). This measure is appropriate if the percentage of documents in the class is high, perhaps 10% to 20% and higher. But as we discussed in Section 8.3 , accuracy is not a good measure for ``small'' classes because always saying no, a strategy that defeats the purpose of building a classifier, will achieve high accuracy. The always-no classifier is 99% accurate for a class with relative frequency 1%. For small classes, precision, recall and are better measures. We will use effectiveness as a generic term for measures that evaluate the quality of classification decisions, including precision, recall, , and accuracy. Performance refers to the computational efficiency of classification and IR systems in this book. However, many researchers mean effectiveness, not efficiency of text classification when they use the term performance.  Figure 13.9: A sample document from the Reuters-21578 collection. When we process a collection with several two-class classifiers (such as Reuters-21578 with its 118 classes), we often want to compute a single aggregate measure that combines the measures for individual classifiers. There are two methods for doing this. Macroaveraging computes a simple average over classes. Microaveraging pools per-document decisions across classes, and then computes an effectiveness measure on the pooled contingency table. Table 13.8 gives an example. The differences between the two methods can be large. Macroaveraging gives equal weight to each class, whereas microaveraging gives equal weight to each per-document classification decision. Because the measure ignores true negatives and its magnitude is mostly determined by the number of true positives, large classes dominate small classes in microaveraging. In the example, microaveraged precision (0.83) is much closer to the precision of (0.9) than to the precision of (0.5) because is five times larger than . Microaveraged results are therefore really a measure of effectiveness on the large classes in a test collection. To get a sense of effectiveness on small classes, you should compute macroaveraged results.   Table 13.8: Macro- and microaveraging. ``Truth'' is the true class and ``call'' the decision of the classifier. In this example, macroaveraged precision is . Microaveraged precision is .   class 1   truth: truth:   yes no call: yes 10 10 call: no 10 970 class 2   truth: truth:   yes no call: yes 90 10 call: no 10 890 pooled table   truth: truth:   yes no call: yes 100 20 call: no 20 1860      Table 13.9: Text classification effectiveness numbers on Reuters-21578 for F (in percent). Results from Li and Yang (2003) (a), Joachims (1998) (b: kNN) and Dumais et al. (1998) (b: NB, Rocchio, trees, SVM).   (a)   NB Rocchio kNN   SVM       micro-avg-L (90 classes) 80 85 86   89       macro-avg (90 classes) 47 59 60   60             (b)   NB Rocchio kNN trees SVM     earn 96 93 97 98 98       acq 88 65 92 90 94       money-fx 57 47 78 66 75       grain 79 68 82 85 95       crude 80 70 86 85 89       trade 64 65 77 73 76       interest 65 63 74 67 78       ship 85 49 79 74 86       wheat 70 69 77 93 92       corn 65 48 78 92 90     micro-avg (top 10) 82 65 82 88 92       micro-avg-D (118 classes) 75 62 n/a n/a 87    In one-of classification (more-than-two-classes), microaveraged is the same as accuracy (Exercise 13.6 ). Table 13.9 gives microaveraged and macroaveraged effectiveness of Naive Bayes for the ModApte split of Reuters-21578. To give a sense of the relative effectiveness of NB, we compare it with linear SVMs (rightmost column; see Chapter 15 ), one of the most effective classifiers, but also one that is more expensive to train than NB. NB has a microaveraged of 80%, which is 9% less than the SVM (89%), a 10% relative decrease (row ``micro-avg-L (90 classes)''). So there is a surprisingly small effectiveness penalty for its simplicity and efficiency. However, on small classes, some of which only have on the order of ten positive examples in the training set, NB does much worse. Its macroaveraged is 13% below the SVM, a 22% relative decrease (row ``macro-avg (90 classes)'' ). The table also compares NB with the other classifiers we cover in this book: Rocchio and kNN. In addition, we give numbers for decision trees , an important classification method we do not cover. The bottom part of the table shows that there is considerable variation from class to class. For instance, NB beats kNN on ship, but is much worse on money-fx. Comparing parts (a) and (b) of the table, one is struck by the degree to which the cited papers' results differ. This is partly due to the fact that the numbers in (b) are break-even scores (cf. page 8.4 ) averaged over 118 classes, whereas the numbers in (a) are true scores (computed without any knowledge of the test set) averaged over ninety classes. This is unfortunately typical of what happens when comparing different results in text classification: There are often differences in the experimental setup or the evaluation that complicate the interpretation of the results. These and other results have shown that the average effectiveness of NB is uncompetitive with classifiers like SVMs when trained and tested on independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) data, that is, uniform data with all the good properties of statistical sampling. However, these differences may often be invisible or even reverse themselves when working in the real world where, usually, the training sample is drawn from a subset of the data to which the classifier will be applied, the nature of the data drifts over time rather than being stationary (the problem of concept drift we mentioned on page 13.4 ), and there may well be errors in the data (among other problems). Many practitioners have had the experience of being unable to build a fancy classifier for a certain problem that consistently performs better than NB. Our conclusion from the results in Table 13.9 is that, although most researchers believe that an SVM is better than kNN and kNN better than NB, the ranking of classifiers ultimately depends on the class, the document collection, and the experimental setup. In text classification, there is always more to know than simply which machine learning algorithm was used, as we further discuss in Section 15.3 (page ). When performing evaluations like the one in Table 13.9 , it is important to maintain a strict separation between the training set and the test set . We can easily make correct classification decisions on the test set by using information we have gleaned from the test set, such as the fact that a particular term is a good predictor in the test set (even though this is not the case in the training set). A more subtle example of using knowledge about the test set is to try a large number of values of a parameter (e.g., the number of selected features) and select the value that is best for the test set. As a rule, accuracy on new data - the type of data we will encounter when we use the classifier in an application - will be much lower than accuracy on a test set that the classifier has been tuned for. We discussed the same problem in ad hoc retrieval in Section 8.1 (page 8.1 ). In a clean statistical text classification experiment, you should never run any program on or even look at the test set while developing a text classification system. Instead, set aside a development set for testing while you develop your method. When such a set serves the primary purpose of finding a good value for a parameter, for example, the number of selected features, then it is also called held-out data . Train the classifier on the rest of the training set with different parameter values, and then select the value that gives best results on the held-out part of the training set. Ideally, at the very end, when all parameters have been set and the method is fully specified, you run one final experiment on the test set and publish the results. Because no information about the test set was used in developing the classifier, the results of this experiment should be indicative of actual performance in practice. This ideal often cannot be met; researchers tend to evaluate several systems on the same test set over a period of several years. But it is nevertheless highly important to not look at the test data and to run systems on it as sparingly as possible. Beginners often violate this rule, and their results lose validity because they have implicitly tuned their system to the test data simply by running many variant systems and keeping the tweaks to the system that worked best on the test set. Exercises. Assume a situation where every document in the test collection has been assigned exactly one class, and that a classifier also assigns exactly one class to each document. This setup is called one-of classification more-than-two-classes. Show that in one-of classification (i) the total number of false positive decisions equals the total number of false negative decisions and (ii) microaveraged and accuracy are identical. The class priors in Figure 13.2 are computed as the fraction of documents in the class as opposed to the fraction of tokens in the class. Why? The function APPLYMULTINOMIALNB in Figure 13.2 has time complexity . How would you modify the function so that its time complexity is ? Table 13.10: Data for parameter estimation exercise.     docID words in document in China?     training set 1 Taipei Taiwan yes       2 Macao Taiwan Shanghai yes       3 Japan Sapporo no       4 Sapporo Osaka Taiwan no     test set 5 Taiwan Taiwan Sapporo ?   Based on the data in Table 13.10 , (i) estimate a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, (ii) apply the classifier to the test document, (iii) estimate a Bernoulli NB classifier, (iv) apply the classifier to the test document. You need not estimate parameters that you don't need for classifying the test document. Your task is to classify words as English or not English. Words are generated by a source with the following distribution:   event word English? probability     1 ozb no 4/9     2 uzu no 4/9     3 zoo yes 1/18     4 bun yes 1/18   (i) Compute the parameters (priors and conditionals) of a multinomial NB classifier that uses the letters b, n, o, u, and z as features. Assume a training set that reflects the probability distribution of the source perfectly. Make the same independence assumptions that are usually made for a multinomial classifier that uses terms as features for text classification. Compute parameters using smoothing, in which computed-zero probabilities are smoothed into probability 0.01, and computed-nonzero probabilities are untouched. (This simplistic smoothing may cause . Solutions are not required to correct this.) (ii) How does the classifier classify the word zoo? (iii) Classify the word zoo using a multinomial classifier as in part (i), but do not make the assumption of positional independence. That is, estimate separate parameters for each position in a word. You only need to compute the parameters you need for classifying zoo. What are the values of and if term and class are completely independent? What are the values if they are completely dependent? The feature selection method in Equation 130 is most appropriate for the Bernoulli model. Why? How could one modify it for the multinomial model? Features can also be selected according to information gain (IG), which is defined as: (138) where is entropy, is the training set, and , and are the subset of with term , and the subset of without term , respectively. is the class distribution in (sub)collection , e.g., if a quarter of the documents in are in class . Show that mutual information and information gain are equivalent. Show that the two formulas ( and 137 ) are equivalent. In the example on page 13.5.2 we have . Show that this holds in general. and mutual information do not distinguish between positively and negatively correlated features. Because most good text classification features are positively correlated (i.e., they occur more often in than in ), one may want to explicitly rule out the selection of negative indicators. How would you do this?

   References and further reading General introductions to statistical classification and machine learning can be found in (Hastie et al., 2001), (Mitchell, 1997), and (Duda et al., 2000), including many important methods (e.g., decision trees and boosting ) that we do not cover. A comprehensive review of text classification methods and results is (Sebastiani, 2002). Manning and Schütze (1999, Chapter 16) give an accessible introduction to text classification with coverage of decision trees, perceptrons and maximum entropy models. More information on the superlinear time complexity of learning methods that are more accurate than Naive Bayes can be found in (Perkins et al., 2003) and (Joachims, 2006a). Maron and Kuhns (1960) described one of the first NB text classifiers. Lewis (1998) focuses on the history of NB classification. Bernoulli and multinomial models and their accuracy for different collections are discussed by McCallum and Nigam (1998). Eyheramendy et al. (2003) present additional NB models. Domingos and Pazzani (1997), Friedman (1997), and Hand and Yu (2001) analyze why NB performs well although its probability estimates are poor. The first paper also discusses NB's optimality when the independence assumptions are true of the data. Pavlov et al. (2004) propose a modified document representation that partially addresses the inappropriateness of the independence assumptions. Bennett (2000) attributes the tendency of NB probability estimates to be close to either 0 or 1 to the effect of document length. Ng and Jordan (2001) show that NB is sometimes (although rarely) superior to discriminative methods because it more quickly reaches its optimal error rate. The basic NB model presented in this chapter can be tuned for better effectiveness (Rennie et al. 2003;Kocz and Yih 2007). The problem of concept drift and other reasons why state-of-the-art classifiers do not always excel in practice are discussed by Forman (2006) and Hand (2006). Early uses of mutual information and for feature selection in text classification are Lewis and Ringuette (1994) and Schütze et al. (1995), respectively. Yang and Pedersen (1997) review feature selection methods and their impact on classification effectiveness. They find that pointwise mutual information is not competitive with other methods. Yang and Pedersen refer to expected mutual information (Equation 130) as information gain (see Exercise 13.6 , page 13.6 ). (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989) is a good reference for the test in statistics, including the Yates' correction for continuity for tables. Dunning (1993) discusses problems of the test when counts are small. Nongreedy feature selection techniques are described by Hastie et al. (2001). Cohen (1995) discusses the pitfalls of using multiple significance tests and methods to avoid them. Forman (2004) evaluates different methods for feature selection for multiple classifiers. David D. Lewis defines the ModApte split at www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/readme.txtbased on Apté et al. (1994). Lewis (1995) describes utility measures for the evaluation of text classification systems. Yang and Liu (1999) employ significance tests in the evaluation of text classification methods. Lewis et al. (2004) find that SVMs (Chapter 15 ) perform better on Reuters-RCV1 than kNN and Rocchio (Chapter 14 ).

  <TITLE>Chapter 14 Vector space classification</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Vector space classification The document representation in Naive Bayes is a sequence of terms or a binary vector . In this chapter we adopt a different representation for text classification, the vector space model, developed in Chapter 6 . It represents each document as a vector with one real-valued component, usually a tf-idf weight, for each term. Thus, the document space , the domain of the classification function , is . This chapter introduces a number of classification methods that operate on real-valued vectors. The basic hypothesis in using the vector space model for classification is the contiguity hypothesis . Contiguity hypothesis. Documents in the same class form a contiguous region and regions of different classes do not overlap. 13 14.1  Figure 14.1: Vector space classification into three classes. Whether or not a set of documents is mapped into a contiguous region depends on the particular choices we make for the document representation: type of weighting, stop list etc. To see that the document representation is crucial, consider the two classes written by a group vs. written by a single person. Frequent occurrence of the first person pronoun I is evidence for the single-person class. But that information is likely deleted from the document representation if we use a stop list. If the document representation chosen is unfavorable, the contiguity hypothesis will not hold and successful vector space classification is not possible. The same considerations that led us to prefer weighted representations, in particular length-normalized tf-idf representations, in Chapters 6 7 also apply here. For example, a term with 5 occurrences in a document should get a higher weight than a term with one occurrence, but a weight 5 times larger would give too much emphasis to the term. Unweighted and unnormalized counts should not be used in vector space classification. We introduce two vector space classification methods in this chapter, Rocchio and kNN. Rocchio classification (Section 14.2 ) divides the vector space into regions centered on centroids or prototypes , one for each class, computed as the center of mass of all documents in the class. Rocchio classification is simple and efficient, but inaccurate if classes are not approximately spheres with similar radii. kNN or nearest neighbor classification (Section 14.3 ) assigns the majority class of the nearest neighbors to a test document. kNN requires no explicit training and can use the unprocessed training set directly in classification. It is less efficient than other classification methods in classifying documents. If the training set is large, then kNN can handle non-spherical and other complex classes better than Rocchio. A large number of text classifiers can be viewed as linear classifiers - classifiers that classify based on a simple linear combination of the features (Section 14.4 ). Such classifiers partition the space of features into regions separated by linear decision hyperplanes , in a manner to be detailed below. Because of the bias-variance tradeoff (Section 14.6 ) more complex nonlinear models are not systematically better than linear models. Nonlinear models have more parameters to fit on a limited amount of training data and are more likely to make mistakes for small and noisy data sets. When applying two-class classifiers to problems with more than two classes, there are one-of tasks - a document must be assigned to exactly one of several mutually exclusive classes - and any-of tasks - a document can be assigned to any number of classes as we will explain in Section 14.5 . Two-class classifiers solve any-of problems and can be combined to solve one-of problems.

  <TITLE>14.1 Document representations and measures of relatedness in vector spaces</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Document representations and measures of relatedness in vector spaces   As in Chapter 6 , we represent documents as vectors in in this chapter. To illustrate properties of document vectors in vector classification, we will render these vectors as points in a plane as in the example in Figure 14.1 . In reality, document vectors are length-normalized unit vectors that point to the surface of a hypersphere. We can view the 2D planes in our figures as projections onto a plane of the surface of a (hyper-)sphere as shown in Figure 14.2 . Distances on the surface of the sphere and on the projection plane are approximately the same as long as we restrict ourselves to small areas of the surface and choose an appropriate projection (Exercise 14.1 ). Decisions of many vector space classifiers are based on a notion of distance, e.g., when computing the nearest neighbors in kNN classification. We will use Euclidean distance in this chapter as the underlying distance measure. We observed earlier (Exercise 6.4.4 , page ) that there is a direct correspondence between cosine similarity and Euclidean distance for length-normalized vectors. In vector space classification, it rarely matters whether the relatedness of two documents is expressed in terms of similarity or distance. However, in addition to documents, centroids or averages of vectors also play an important role in vector space classification. Centroids are not length-normalized. For unnormalized vectors, dot product, cosine similarity and Euclidean distance all have different behavior in general (Exercise 14.8 ). We will be mostly concerned with small local regions when computing the similarity between a document and a centroid, and the smaller the region the more similar the behavior of the three measures is. Exercises. For small areas, distances on the surface of the hypersphere are approximated well by distances on its projection (Figure 14.2 ) because for small angles. For what size angle is the distortion (i) 1.01, (ii) 1.05 and (iii) 1.1?

   Rocchio classification 14.1  decision boundaries  Figure 14.3: Rocchio classification. Perhaps the best-known way of computing good class boundaries is Rocchio classification , which uses centroids to define the boundaries. The centroid of a class is computed as the vector average or center of mass of its members:     (139)          25 6.3.1 14.3 The boundary between two classes in Rocchio classification is the set of points with equal distance from the two centroids. For example, , , and in the figure. This set of points is always a line. The generalization of a line in -dimensional space is a hyperplane, which we define as the set of points that satisfy:     (140)      normal vector     Thus, the boundaries of class regions in Rocchio classification are hyperplanes. The classification rule in Rocchio is to classify a point in accordance with the region it falls into. Equivalently, we determine the centroid that the point is closest to and then assign it to . As an example, consider the star in Figure 14.3 . It is located in the China region of the space and Rocchio therefore assigns it to China. We show the Rocchio algorithm in pseudocode in Figure 14.4 .   Table 14.1: Vectors and class centroids for the data in Table 13.1 .   term weights vector Chinese Japan Tokyo Macao Beijing Shanghai 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.33 0.33 0.33 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0   Worked example. Table 14.1 shows the tf-idf vector representations of the five documents in Table 13.1 (page 13.1 ), using the formula if (Equation 29, page 6.4.1 ). The two class centroids are and . The distances of the test document from the centroids are and . Thus, Rocchio assigns to . The separating hyperplane in this case has the following parameters:     14.8            End worked example. The assignment criterion in Figure 14.4 is Euclidean distance (APPLYROCCHIO, line 1). An alternative is cosine similarity: (141)  14.1  16.4 16.4  Figure 14.4: Rocchio classification: Training and testing. Rocchio classification is a form of Rocchio relevance feedback (Section 9.1.1 , page 9.1.1 ). The average of the relevant documents, corresponding to the most important component of the Rocchio vector in relevance feedback (Equation 49, page 49 ), is the centroid of the ``class'' of relevant documents. We omit the query component of the Rocchio formula in Rocchio classification since there is no query in text classification. Rocchio classification can be applied to classes whereas Rocchio relevance feedback is designed to distinguish only two classes, relevant and nonrelevant. In addition to respecting contiguity, the classes in Rocchio classification must be approximate spheres with similar radii. In Figure 14.3 , the solid square just below the boundary between UK and Kenya is a better fit for the class UK since UK is more scattered than Kenya. But Rocchio assigns it to Kenya because it ignores details of the distribution of points in a class and only uses distance from the centroid for classification.   The assumption of sphericity also does not hold in Figure 14.5 . We cannot represent the ``a'' class well with a single prototype because it has two clusters. Rocchio often misclassifies this type of multimodal class . A text classification example for multimodality is a country like Burma, which changed its name to Myanmar in 1989. The two clusters before and after the name change need not be close to each other in space. We also encountered the problem of multimodality in relevance feedback (Section 9.1.2 , page 9.1.3 ). Two-class classification is another case where classes are rarely distributed like spheres with similar radii. Most two-class classifiers distinguish between a class like China that occupies a small region of the space and its widely scattered complement. Assuming equal radii will result in a large number of false positives. Most two-class classification problems therefore require a modified decision rule of the form: (142)        mode time complexity training testing Training and test times for Rocchio classification. is the average number of tokens per document. and are the numbers of tokens and types, respectively, in the test document. Computing Euclidean distance between the class centroids and a document is .  Table 14.2 gives the time complexity of Rocchio classification. Adding all documents to their respective (unnormalized) centroid is (as opposed to ) since we need only consider non-zero entries. Dividing each vector sum by the size of its class to compute the centroid is . Overall, training time is linear in the size of the collection (cf. Exercise 13.2.1 ). Thus, Rocchio classification and Naive Bayes have the same linear training time complexity. In the next section, we will introduce another vector space classification method, kNN, that deals better with classes that have non-spherical, disconnected or other irregular shapes.   Exercises. Show that Rocchio classification can assign a label to a document that is different from its training set label.

  <TITLE>14.3 k nearest neighbor</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   k nearest neighbor Unlike Rocchio, nearest neighbor or kNN classification determines the decision boundary locally. For 1NN we assign each document to the class of its closest neighbor. For kNN we assign each document to the majority class of its closest neighbors where is a parameter. The rationale of kNN classification is that, based on the contiguity hypothesis, we expect a test document to have the same label as the training documents located in the local region surrounding . Decision boundaries in 1NN are concatenated segments of the Voronoi tessellation as shown in Figure 14.6 . The Voronoi tessellation of a set of objects decomposes space into Voronoi cells, where each object's cell consists of all points that are closer to the object than to other objects. In our case, the objects are documents. The Voronoi tessellation then partitions the plane into convex polygons, each containing its corresponding document (and no other) as shown in Figure 14.6 , where a convex polygon is a convex region in 2-dimensional space bounded by lines. For general in kNN, consider the region in the space for which the set of nearest neighbors is the same. This again is a convex polygon and the space is partitioned into convex polygons , within each of which the set of nearest neighbors is invariant (Exercise 14.8 ). 1NN is not very robust. The classification decision of each test document relies on the class of a single training document, which may be incorrectly labeled or atypical. kNN for is more robust. It assigns documents to the majority class of their closest neighbors, with ties broken randomly. There is a probabilistic version of this kNN classification algorithm. We can estimate the probability of membership in class as the proportion of the nearest neighbors in . Figure 14.6 gives an example for . Probability estimates for class membership of the star are , , and . The 3nn estimate ( ) and the 1nn estimate ( ) differ with 3nn preferring the X class and 1nn preferring the circle class . The parameter in kNN is often chosen based on experience or knowledge about the classification problem at hand.

   Time complexity and optimality of kNN   kNN with preprocessing of training set training testing kNN without preprocessing of training set training testing Training and test times for kNN classification. is the average size of the vocabulary of documents in the collection.  Table 14.3 gives the time complexity of kNN. kNN has properties that are quite different from most other classification algorithms. Training a kNN classifier simply consists of determining and preprocessing documents. In fact, if we preselect a value for and do not preprocess, then kNN requires no training at all. In practice, we have to perform preprocessing steps like tokenization. It makes more sense to preprocess training documents once as part of the training phase rather than repeatedly every time we classify a new test document. Test time is for kNN. It is linear in the size of the training set as we need to compute the distance of each training document from the test document. Test time is independent of the number of classes . kNN therefore has a potential advantage for problems with large . In kNN classification, we do not perform any estimation of parameters as we do in Rocchio classification (centroids) or in Naive Bayes (priors and conditional probabilities). kNN simply memorizes all examples in the training set and then compares the test document to them. For this reason, kNN is also called memory-based learning or instance-based learning . It is usually desirable to have as much training data as possible in machine learning. But in kNN large training sets come with a severe efficiency penalty in classification. Can kNN testing be made more efficient than or, ignoring the length of documents, more efficient than ? There are fast kNN algorithms for small dimensionality (Exercise 14.8 ). There are also approximations for large that give error bounds for specific efficiency gains (see Section 14.7 ). These approximations have not been extensively tested for text classification applications, so it is not clear whether they can achieve much better efficiency than without a significant loss of accuracy. The reader may have noticed the similarity between the problem of finding nearest neighbors of a test document and ad hoc retrieval, where we search for the documents with the highest similarity to the query (Section 6.3.2 , page 6.3.2 ). In fact, the two problems are both nearest neighbor problems and only differ in the relative density of (the vector of) the test document in kNN (10s or 100s of non-zero entries) versus the sparseness of (the vector of) the query in ad hoc retrieval (usually fewer than 10 non-zero entries). We introduced the inverted index for efficient ad hoc retrieval in Section 1.1 (page 1.1 ). Is the inverted index also the solution for efficient kNN? An inverted index restricts a search to those documents that have at least one term in common with the query. Thus in the context of kNN, the inverted index will be efficient if the test document has no term overlap with a large number of training documents. Whether this is the case depends on the classification problem. If documents are long and no stop list is used, then less time will be saved. But with short documents and a large stop list, an inverted index may well cut the average test time by a factor of 10 or more. The search time in an inverted index is a function of the length of the postings lists of the terms in the query. Postings lists grow sublinearly with the length of the collection since the vocabulary increases according to Heaps' law - if the probability of occurrence of some terms increases, then the probability of occurrence of others must decrease. However, most new terms are infrequent. We therefore take the complexity of inverted index search to be (as discussed in Section 2.4.2 , page 2.4.2 ) and, assuming average document length does not change over time, . As we will see in the next chapter, kNN's effectiveness is close to that of the most accurate learning methods in text classification (Table 15.2 , page 15.2 ). A measure of the quality of a learning method is its Bayes error rate , the average error rate of classifiers learned by it for a particular problem. kNN is not optimal for problems with a non-zero Bayes error rate - that is, for problems where even the best possible classifier has a non-zero classification error. The error of 1NN is asymptotically (as the training set increases) bounded by twice the Bayes error rate. That is, if the optimal classifier has an error rate of , then 1NN has an asymptotic error rate of less than . This is due to the effect of noise - we already saw one example of noise in the form of noisy features in Section 13.5 (page 13.5 ), but noise can also take other forms as we will discuss in the next section. Noise affects two components of kNN: the test document and the closest training document. The two sources of noise are additive, so the overall error of 1NN is twice the optimal error rate. For problems with Bayes error rate 0, the error rate of 1NN will approach 0 as the size of the training set increases. Exercises. Explain why kNN handles multimodal classes better than Rocchio.

  <TITLE>14.4 Linear versus nonlinear classifiers</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Linear versus nonlinear classifiers In this section, we show that the two learning methods Naive Bayes and Rocchio are instances of linear classifiers, the perhaps most important group of text classifiers, and contrast them with nonlinear classifiers. To simplify the discussion, we will only consider two-class classifiers in this section and define a linear classifier as a two-class classifier that decides class membership by comparing a linear combination of the features to a threshold.  Figure 14.8: There are an infinite number of hyperplanes that separate two linearly separable classes. In two dimensions, a linear classifier is a line. Five examples are shown in Figure 14.8 . These lines have the functional form . The classification rule of a linear classifier is to assign a document to if and to if . Here, is the two-dimensional vector representation of the document and is the parameter vector that defines (together with ) the decision boundary. An alternative geometric interpretation of a linear classifier is provided in Figure 15.7 (page ). We can generalize this 2D linear classifier to higher dimensions by defining a hyperplane as we did in Equation 140, repeated here as Equation 144: (144)        decision hyperplane  Figure 14.9: Linear classification algorithm. The corresponding algorithm for linear classification in dimensions is shown in Figure 14.9 . Linear classification at first seems trivial given the simplicity of this algorithm. However, the difficulty is in training the linear classifier, that is, in determining the parameters and based on the training set. In general, some learning methods compute much better parameters than others where our criterion for evaluating the quality of a learning method is the effectiveness of the learned linear classifier on new data. We now show that Rocchio and Naive Bayes are linear classifiers. To see this for Rocchio, observe that a vector is on the decision boundary if it has equal distance to the two class centroids:     (145)     14.8 We can derive the linearity of Naive Bayes from its decision rule, which chooses the category with the largest (Figure 13.2 , page 13.2 ) where: (146)         (147)   We choose class if the odds are greater than 1 or, equivalently, if the log odds are greater than 0. It is easy to see that Equation 147 is an instance of Equation 144 for , number of occurrences of in , and . Here, the index , , refers to terms of the vocabulary (not to positions in as does; cf. variantmultinomial) and and are -dimensional vectors. So in log space, Naive Bayes is a linear classifier.   prime 0.70 0 1 dlrs -0.71 1 1 rate 0.67 1 0 world -0.35 1 0 interest 0.63 0 0 sees -0.33 0 0 rates 0.60 0 0 year -0.25 0 0 discount 0.46 1 0 group -0.24 0 0 bundesbank 0.43 0 0 dlr -0.24 0 0 A linear classifier. The dimensions and parameters of a linear classifier for the class interest (as in interest rate) in Reuters-21578. The threshold is . Terms like dlr and world have negative weights because they are indicators for the competing class currency.  Worked example. Table 14.4 defines a linear classifier for the category interest in Reuters-21578 (see Section 13.6 , page 13.6 ). We assign document ``rate discount dlrs world'' to interest since . We assign ``prime dlrs'' to the complement class (not in interest) since . For simplicity, we assume a simple binary vector representation in this example: 1 for occurring terms, 0 for non-occurring terms. End worked example.  A linear problem with noise. In this hypothetical web page classification scenario, Chinese-only web pages are solid circles and mixed Chinese-English web pages are squares. The two classes are separated by a linear class boundary (dashed line, short dashes), except for three noise documents (marked with arrows). Figure 14.10 is a graphical example of a linear problem, which we define to mean that the underlying distributions and of the two classes are separated by a line. We call this separating line the class boundary . It is the ``true'' boundary of the two classes and we distinguish it from the decision boundary that the learning method computes to approximate the class boundary. As is typical in text classification, there are some noise documents in Figure 14.10 (marked with arrows) that do not fit well into the overall distribution of the classes. In Section 13.5 (page 13.5 ), we defined a noise feature as a misleading feature that, when included in the document representation, on average increases the classification error. Analogously, a noise document is a document that, when included in the training set, misleads the learning method and increases classification error. Intuitively, the underlying distribution partitions the representation space into areas with mostly homogeneous class assignments. A document that does not conform with the dominant class in its area is a noise document. Noise documents are one reason why training a linear classifier is hard. If we pay too much attention to noise documents when choosing the decision hyperplane of the classifier, then it will be inaccurate on new data. More fundamentally, it is usually difficult to determine which documents are noise documents and therefore potentially misleading. If there exists a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two classes, then we call the two classes linearly separable . In fact, if linear separability holds, then there is an infinite number of linear separators (Exercise 14.4 ) as illustrated by Figure 14.8 , where the number of possible separating hyperplanes is infinite. Figure 14.8 illustrates another challenge in training a linear classifier. If we are dealing with a linearly separable problem, then we need a criterion for selecting among all decision hyperplanes that perfectly separate the training data. In general, some of these hyperplanes will do well on new data, some will not.  Figure 14.11: A nonlinear problem. An example of a nonlinear classifier is kNN. The nonlinearity of kNN is intuitively clear when looking at examples like Figure 14.6 . The decision boundaries of kNN (the double lines in Figure 14.6 ) are locally linear segments, but in general have a complex shape that is not equivalent to a line in 2D or a hyperplane in higher dimensions. Figure 14.11 is another example of a nonlinear problem: there is no good linear separator between the distributions and because of the circular ``enclave'' in the upper left part of the graph. Linear classifiers misclassify the enclave, whereas a nonlinear classifier like kNN will be highly accurate for this type of problem if the training set is large enough. If a problem is nonlinear and its class boundaries cannot be approximated well with linear hyperplanes, then nonlinear classifiers are often more accurate than linear classifiers. If a problem is linear, it is best to use a simpler linear classifier. Exercises. Prove that the number of linear separators of two classes is either infinite or zero.

  <TITLE>14.5 Classification with more than two classes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Classification with more than two classes  Classification for classes that are not mutually exclusive is called any-of , multilabel , or multivalue classification . In this case, a document can belong to several classes simultaneously, or to a single class, or to none of the classes. A decision on one class leaves all options open for the others. It is sometimes said that the classes are independent of each other, but this is misleading since the classes are rarely statistically independent in the sense defined on page 13.5.2 . In terms of the formal definition of the classification problem in Equation 112 (page 112 ), we learn different classifiers in any-of classification, each returning either or : . Solving an any-of classification task with linear classifiers is straightforward: Build a classifier for each class, where the training set consists of the set of documents in the class (positive labels) and its complement (negative labels). Given the test document, apply each classifier separately. The decision of one classifier has no influence on the decisions of the other classifiers. The second type of classification with more than two classes is one-of classification . Here, the classes are mutually exclusive. Each document must belong to exactly one of the classes. One-of classification is also called multinomial , polytomous , multiclass , or single-label classification . Formally, there is a single classification function in one-of classification whose range is , i.e., . kNN is a (nonlinear) one-of classifier. True one-of problems are less common in text classification than any-of problems. With classes like UK, China, poultry, or coffee, a document can be relevant to many topics simultaneously - as when the prime minister of the UK visits China to talk about the coffee and poultry trade. Nevertheless, we will often make a one-of assumption, as we did in Figure 14.1 , even if classes are not really mutually exclusive. For the classification problem of identifying the language of a document, the one-of assumption is a good approximation as most text is written in only one language. In such cases, imposing a one-of constraint can increase the classifier's effectiveness because errors that are due to the fact that the any-of classifiers assigned a document to either no class or more than one class are eliminated.  Figure 14.12: hyperplanes do not divide space into disjoint regions.    14.12   Build a classifier for each class, where the training set consists of the set of documents in the class (positive labels) and its complement (negative labels). Given the test document, apply each classifier separately. Assign the document to the class with the maximum score, the maximum confidence value, or the maximum probability.     assigned class money-fx trade interest wheat corn grain true class               money-fx   95 0 10 0 0 0 trade   1 1 90 0 1 0 interest   13 0 0 0 0 0 wheat   0 0 1 34 3 7 corn   1 0 2 13 26 5 grain   0 0 2 14 5 10 A confusion matrix for Reuters-21578.For example, 14 documents from grain were incorrectly assigned to wheat. Adapted from Picca et al. (2006).  An important tool for analyzing the performance of a classifier for classes is the confusion matrix . The confusion matrix shows for each pair of classes , how many documents from were incorrectly assigned to . In Table 14.5 , the classifier manages to distinguish the three financial classes money-fx, trade, and interest from the three agricultural classes wheat, corn, and grain, but makes many errors within these two groups. The confusion matrix can help pinpoint opportunities for improving the accuracy of the system. For example, to address the second largest error in Table 14.5 (14 in the row grain), one could attempt to introduce features that distinguish wheat documents from grain documents. Exercises. Create a training set of 300 documents, 100 each from three different languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish). Create a test set by the same procedure, but also add 100 documents from a fourth language. Train (i) a one-of classifier (ii) an any-of classifier on this training set and evaluate it on the test set. (iii) Are there any interesting differences in how the two classifiers behave on this task?

  <TITLE>14.6 The bias-variance tradeoff</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The bias-variance tradeoff Nonlinear classifiers are more powerful than linear classifiers. For some problems, there exists a nonlinear classifier with zero classification error, but no such linear classifier. Does that mean that we should always use nonlinear classifiers for optimal effectiveness in statistical text classification? To answer this question, we introduce the bias-variance tradeoff in this section, one of the most important concepts in machine learning. The tradeoff helps explain why there is no universally optimal learning method. Selecting an appropriate learning method is therefore an unavoidable part of solving a text classification problem. Throughout this section, we use linear and nonlinear classifiers as prototypical examples of ``less powerful'' and ``more powerful'' learning, respectively. This is a simplification for a number of reasons. First, many nonlinear models subsume linear models as a special case. For instance, a nonlinear learning method like kNN will in some cases produce a linear classifier. Second, there are nonlinear models that are less complex than linear models. For instance, a quadratic polynomial with two parameters is less powerful than a 10,000-dimensional linear classifier. Third, the complexity of learning is not really a property of the classifier because there are many aspects of learning (such as feature selection, cf. feature, regularization, and constraints such as margin maximization in Chapter 15 ) that make a learning method either more powerful or less powerful without affecting the type of classifier that is the final result of learning - regardless of whether that classifier is linear or nonlinear. We refer the reader to the publications listed in Section 14.7 for a treatment of the bias-variance tradeoff that takes into account these complexities. In this section, linear and nonlinear classifiers will simply serve as proxies for weaker and stronger learning methods in text classification. We first need to state our objective in text classification more precisely. In Section 13.1 (page ), we said that we want to minimize classification error on the test set. The implicit assumption was that training documents and test documents are generated according to the same underlying distribution. We will denote this distribution where is the document and its label or class. graphclassmodelbernoulligraph were examples of generative models that decompose into the product of and . typicallineartypicalnonlinear depict generative models for with and . In this section, instead of using the number of correctly classified test documents (or, equivalently, the error rate on test documents) as evaluation measure, we adopt an evaluation measure that addresses the inherent uncertainty of labeling. In many text classification problems, a given document representation can arise from documents belonging to different classes. This is because documents from different classes can be mapped to the same document representation. For example, the one-sentence documents China sues France and France sues China are mapped to the same document representation in a bag of words model. But only the latter document is relevant to the class legal actions brought by France (which might be defined, for example, as a standing query by an international trade lawyer). To simplify the calculations in this section, we do not count the number of errors on the test set when evaluating a classifier, but instead look at how well the classifier estimates the conditional probability of a document being in a class. In the above example, we might have . Our goal in text classification then is to find a classifier such that, averaged over documents , is as close as possible to the true probability . We measure this using mean squared error:     (148)      We define a classifier to be optimal for a distribution if it minimizes . Minimizing MSE is a desideratum for classifiers. We also need a criterion for learning methods. Recall that we defined a learning method as a function that takes a labeled training set as input and returns a classifier . For learning methods, we adopt as our goal to find a that, averaged over training sets, learns classifiers with minimal MSE. We can formalize this as minimizing learning error :     (149)      We can use learning error as a criterion for selecting a learning method in statistical text classification. A learning method is optimal for a distribution if it minimizes the learning error.  (150)   (151)     (152)   (153)     (154)   (155)       (156) (157)   (158)     (159)   157   150   Writing for for better readability, we can transform Equation 149 as follows: (160)   (161)   (162) (163) (164)   162 157 14.6       Bias is the squared difference between , the true conditional probability of being in , and , the prediction of the learned classifier, averaged over training sets. Bias is large if the learning method produces classifiers that are consistently wrong. Bias is small if (i) the classifiers are consistently right or (ii) different training sets cause errors on different documents or (iii) different training sets cause positive and negative errors on the same documents, but that average out to close to 0. If one of these three conditions holds, then , the expectation over all training sets, is close to . Linear methods like Rocchio and Naive Bayes have a high bias for nonlinear problems because they can only model one type of class boundary, a linear hyperplane. If the generative model has a complex nonlinear class boundary, the bias term in Equation 162 will be high because a large number of points will be consistently misclassified. For example, the circular enclave in Figure 14.11 does not fit a linear model and will be misclassified consistently by linear classifiers. We can think of bias as resulting from our domain knowledge (or lack thereof) that we build into the classifier. If we know that the true boundary between the two classes is linear, then a learning method that produces linear classifiers is more likely to succeed than a nonlinear method. But if the true class boundary is not linear and we incorrectly bias the classifier to be linear, then classification accuracy will be low on average. Nonlinear methods like kNN have low bias. We can see in Figure 14.6 that the decision boundaries of kNN are variable - depending on the distribution of documents in the training set, learned decision boundaries can vary greatly. As a result, each document has a chance of being classified correctly for some training sets. The average prediction is therefore closer to and bias is smaller than for a linear learning method. Variance is the variation of the prediction of learned classifiers: the average squared difference between and its average . Variance is large if different training sets give rise to very different classifiers . It is small if the training set has a minor effect on the classification decisions makes, be they correct or incorrect. Variance measures how inconsistent the decisions are, not whether they are correct or incorrect. Linear learning methods have low variance because most randomly drawn training sets produce similar decision hyperplanes. The decision lines produced by linear learning methods in and 14.11 will deviate slightly from the main class boundaries, depending on the training set, but the class assignment for the vast majority of documents (with the exception of those close to the main boundary) will not be affected. The circular enclave in Figure 14.11 will be consistently misclassified. Nonlinear methods like kNN have high variance. It is apparent from Figure 14.6 that kNN can model very complex boundaries between two classes. It is therefore sensitive to noise documents of the sort depicted in Figure 14.10 . As a result the variance term in Equation 162 is large for kNN: Test documents are sometimes misclassified - if they happen to be close to a noise document in the training set - and sometimes correctly classified - if there are no noise documents in the training set near them. This results in high variation from training set to training set. High-variance learning methods are prone to overfitting the training data. The goal in classification is to fit the training data to the extent that we capture true properties of the underlying distribution . In overfitting, the learning method also learns from noise. Overfitting increases MSE and frequently is a problem for high-variance learning methods. We can also think of variance as the model complexity or, equivalently, memory capacity of the learning method - how detailed a characterization of the training set it can remember and then apply to new data. This capacity corresponds to the number of independent parameters available to fit the training set. Each kNN neighborhood makes an independent classification decision. The parameter in this case is the estimate from Figure 14.7 . Thus, kNN's capacity is only limited by the size of the training set. It can memorize arbitrarily large training sets. In contrast, the number of parameters of Rocchio is fixed - parameters per dimension, one for each centroid - and independent of the size of the training set. The Rocchio classifier (in form of the centroids defining it) cannot ``remember'' fine-grained details of the distribution of the documents in the training set. According to Equation 149, our goal in selecting a learning method is to minimize learning error. The fundamental insight captured by Equation 162, which we can succinctly state as: learning-error = bias + variance, is that the learning error has two components, bias and variance, which in general cannot be minimized simultaneously. When comparing two learning methods and , in most cases the comparison comes down to one method having higher bias and lower variance and the other lower bias and higher variance. The decision for one learning method vs. another is then not simply a matter of selecting the one that reliably produces good classifiers across training sets (small variance) or the one that can learn classification problems with very difficult decision boundaries (small bias). Instead, we have to weigh the respective merits of bias and variance in our application and choose accordingly. This tradeoff is called the bias-variance tradeoff . Figure 14.10 provides an illustration, which is somewhat contrived, but will be useful as an example for the tradeoff. Some Chinese text contains English words written in the Roman alphabet like CPU, ONLINE, and GPS. Consider the task of distinguishing Chinese-only web pages from mixed Chinese-English web pages. A search engine might offer Chinese users without knowledge of English (but who understand loanwords like CPU) the option of filtering out mixed pages. We use two features for this classification task: number of Roman alphabet characters and number of Chinese characters on the web page. As stated earlier, the distribution ) of the generative model generates most mixed (respectively, Chinese) documents above (respectively, below) the short-dashed line, but there are a few noise documents. In Figure 14.10 , we see three classifiers: One-feature classifier. Shown as a dotted horizontal line. This classifier uses only one feature, the number of Roman alphabet characters. Assuming a learning method that minimizes the number of misclassifications in the training set, the position of the horizontal decision boundary is not greatly affected by differences in the training set (e.g., noise documents). So a learning method producing this type of classifier has low variance. But its bias is high since it will consistently misclassify squares in the lower left corner and ``solid circle'' documents with more than 50 Roman characters. Linear classifier. Shown as a dashed line with long dashes. Learning linear classifiers has less bias since only noise documents and possibly a few documents close to the boundary between the two classes are misclassified. The variance is higher than for the one-feature classifiers, but still small: The dashed line with long dashes deviates only slightly from the true boundary between the two classes, and so will almost all linear decision boundaries learned from training sets. Thus, very few documents (documents close to the class boundary) will be inconsistently classified. ``Fit-training-set-perfectly'' classifier. Shown as a solid line. Here, the learning method constructs a decision boundary that perfectly separates the classes in the training set. This method has the lowest bias because there is no document that is consistently misclassified - the classifiers sometimes even get noise documents in the test set right. But the variance of this learning method is high. Because noise documents can move the decision boundary arbitrarily, test documents close to noise documents in the training set will be misclassified - something that a linear learning method is unlikely to do. It is perhaps surprising that so many of the best-known text classification algorithms are linear. Some of these methods, in particular linear SVMs, regularized logistic regression and regularized linear regression, are among the most effective known methods. The bias-variance tradeoff provides insight into their success. Typical classes in text classification are complex and seem unlikely to be modeled well linearly. However, this intuition is misleading for the high-dimensional spaces that we typically encounter in text applications. With increased dimensionality, the likelihood of linear separability increases rapidly (Exercise 14.8 ). Thus, linear models in high-dimensional spaces are quite powerful despite their linearity. Even more powerful nonlinear learning methods can model decision boundaries that are more complex than a hyperplane, but they are also more sensitive to noise in the training data. Nonlinear learning methods sometimes perform better if the training set is large, but by no means in all cases.

   References and further reading As discussed in Chapter 9 , Rocchio relevance feedback is due to Rocchio (1971). Joachims (1997) presents a probabilistic analysis of the method. Rocchio classification was widely used as a classification method in in the 1990s (Buckley et al., 1994b;a, Voorhees and Harman, 2005). Initially, it was used as a form of routing . Routing merely ranks documents according to relevance to a class without assigning them. Early work on filtering , a true classification approach that makes an assignment decision on each document, was published by Ittner et al. (1995) and Schapire et al. (1998). The definition of routing we use here should not be confused with another sense. Routing can also refer to the electronic distribution of documents to subscribers, the so-called push model of document distribution. In a pull model , each transfer of a document to the user is initiated by the user - for example, by means of search or by selecting it from a list of documents on a news aggregation website. Some authors restrict the name Roccchio classification to two-class problems and use the terms cluster-based (Iwayama and Tokunaga, 1995) and centroid-based classification (Han and Karypis, 2000, Tan and Cheng, 2007) for Rocchio classification with . A more detailed treatment of kNN can be found in (Hastie et al., 2001), including methods for tuning the parameter . An example of an approximate fast kNN algorithm is locality-based hashing (Andoni et al., 2006). Kleinberg (1997) presents an approximate kNN algorithm (where is the dimensionality of the space and the number of data points), but at the cost of exponential storage requirements: . Indyk (2004) surveys nearest neighbor methods in high-dimensional spaces. Early work on kNN in text classification was motivated by the availability of massively parallel hardware architectures (Creecy et al., 1992). Yang (1994) uses an inverted index to speed up kNN classification. The optimality result for 1NN (twice the Bayes error rate asymptotically) is due to Cover and Hart (1967). The effectiveness of Rocchio classification and kNN is highly dependent on careful parameter tuning (in particular, the parameters for Rocchio on page 14.2 and for kNN), feature engineering svm-text and feature selection feature. Buckley and Salton (1995), Yang and Kisiel (2003), Schapire et al. (1998) and Moschitti (2003) address these issues for Rocchio and Yang (2001) and Ault and Yang (2002) for kNN. Zavrel et al. (2000) compare feature selection methods for kNN. The bias-variance tradeoff was introduced by Geman et al. (1992). The derivation in Section 14.6 is for , but the tradeoff applies to many loss functions (cf. Friedman (1997), Domingos (2000)). Schütze et al. (1995) and Lewis et al. (1996) discuss linear classifiers for text and Hastie et al. (2001) linear classifiers in general. Readers interested in the algorithms mentioned, but not described in this chapter may wish to consult Bishop (2006) for neural networks, Hastie et al. (2001) for linear and logistic regression, and Minsky and Papert (1988) for the perceptron algorithm . Anagnostopoulos et al. (2006) show that an inverted index can be used for highly efficient document classification with any linear classifier, provided that the classifier is still effective when trained on a modest number of features via feature selection. We have only presented the simplest method for combining two-class classifiers into a one-of classifier. Another important method is the use of error-correcting codes, where a vector of decisions of different two-class classifiers is constructed for each document. A test document's decision vector is then ``corrected'' based on the distribution of decision vectors in the training set, a procedure that incorporates information from all two-class classifiers and their correlations into the final classification decision (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995). Ghamrawi and McCallum (2005) also exploit dependencies between classes in any-of classification. Allwein et al. (2000) propose a general framework for combining two-class classifiers.

  <TITLE>Chapter 15 Support vector machines and machine learning on documents</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Support vector machines and machine learning on documents Improving classifier effectiveness has been an area of intensive machine-learning research over the last two decades, and this work has led to a new generation of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as support vector machines, boosted decision trees, regularized logistic regression, neural networks, and random forests. Many of these methods, including support vector machines (SVMs), the main topic of this chapter, have been applied with success to information retrieval problems, particularly text classification. An SVM is a kind of large-margin classifier: it is a vector space based machine learning method where the goal is to find a decision boundary between two classes that is maximally far from any point in the training data (possibly discounting some points as outliers or noise). We will initially motivate and develop SVMs for the case of two-class data sets that are separable by a linear classifier (Section 15.1 ), and then extend the model in Section 15.2 to non-separable data, multi-class problems, and nonlinear models, and also present some additional discussion of SVM performance. The chapter then moves to consider the practical deployment of text classifiers in Section 15.3 : what sorts of classifiers are appropriate when, and how can you exploit domain-specific text features in classification? Finally, we will consider how the machine learning technology that we have been building for text classification can be applied back to the problem of learning how to rank documents in ad hoc retrieval (Section 15.4 ). While several machine learning methods have been applied to this task, use of SVMs has been prominent. Support vector machines are not necessarily better than other machine learning methods (except perhaps in situations with little training data), but they perform at the state-of-the-art level and have much current theoretical and empirical appeal.

  <TITLE>15.1 Support vector machines: The linearly separable case</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Support vector machines: The linearly separable case  Figure 15.1: The support vectors are the 5 points right up against the margin of the classifier. For two-class, separable training data sets, such as the one in Figure 14.8 (page ), there are lots of possible linear separators. Intuitively, a decision boundary drawn in the middle of the void between data items of the two classes seems better than one which approaches very close to examples of one or both classes. While some learning methods such as the perceptron algorithm (see references in vclassfurther) find just any linear separator, others, like Naive Bayes, search for the best linear separator according to some criterion. The SVM in particular defines the criterion to be looking for a decision surface that is maximally far away from any data point. This distance from the decision surface to the closest data point determines the margin of the classifier. This method of construction necessarily means that the decision function for an SVM is fully specified by a (usually small) subset of the data which defines the position of the separator. These points are referred to as the support vectors (in a vector space, a point can be thought of as a vector between the origin and that point). Figure 15.1 shows the margin and support vectors for a sample problem. Other data points play no part in determining the decision surface that is chosen.  An intuition for large-margin classification.Insisting on a large margin reduces the capacity of the model: the range of angles at which the fat decision surface can be placed is smaller than for a decision hyperplane (cf. vclassline). Maximizing the margin seems good because points near the decision surface represent very uncertain classification decisions: there is almost a 50% chance of the classifier deciding either way. A classifier with a large margin makes no low certainty classification decisions. This gives you a classification safety margin: a slight error in measurement or a slight document variation will not cause a misclassification. Another intuition motivating SVMs is shown in Figure 15.2 . By construction, an SVM classifier insists on a large margin around the decision boundary. Compared to a decision hyperplane, if you have to place a fat separator between classes, you have fewer choices of where it can be put. As a result of this, the memory capacity of the model has been decreased, and hence we expect that its ability to correctly generalize to test data is increased (cf. the discussion of the bias-variance tradeoff in Chapter 14 , page 14.6 ). Let us formalize an SVM with algebra. A decision hyperplane (page 14.4 ) can be defined by an intercept term and a decision hyperplane normal vector which is perpendicular to the hyperplane. This vector is commonly referred to in the machine learning literature as the weight vector . To choose among all the hyperplanes that are perpendicular to the normal vector, we specify the intercept term . Because the hyperplane is perpendicular to the normal vector, all points on the hyperplane satisfy . Now suppose that we have a set of training data points , where each member is a pair of a point and a class label corresponding to it.For SVMs, the two data classes are always named and (rather than 1 and 0), and the intercept term is always explicitly represented as (rather than being folded into the weight vector by adding an extra always-on feature). The math works out much more cleanly if you do things this way, as we will see almost immediately in the definition of functional margin. The linear classifier is then: (165)    We are confident in the classification of a point if it is far away from the decision boundary. For a given data set and decision hyperplane, we define the functional margin of the example with respect to a hyperplane as the quantity . The functional margin of a data set with respect to a decision surface is then twice the functional margin of any of the points in the data set with minimal functional margin (the factor of 2 comes from measuring across the whole width of the margin, as in Figure 15.3 ). However, there is a problem with using this definition as is: the value is underconstrained, because we can always make the functional margin as big as we wish by simply scaling up and . For example, if we replace by and by then the functional margin is five times as large. This suggests that we need to place some constraint on the size of the vector. To get a sense of how to do that, let us look at the actual geometry.  Figure 15.3: The geometric margin of a point ( ) and a decision boundary ( ). What is the Euclidean distance from a point to the decision boundary? In Figure 15.3 , we denote by this distance. We know that the shortest distance between a point and a hyperplane is perpendicular to the plane, and hence, parallel to . A unit vector in this direction is . The dotted line in the diagram is then a translation of the vector . Let us label the point on the hyperplane closest to as . Then: (166)       (167)     (168)   geometric margin  168 15.2       6  Since we can scale the functional margin as we please, for convenience in solving large SVMs, let us choose to require that the functional margin of all data points is at least 1 and that it is equal to 1 for at least one data vector. That is, for all items in the data: (169)      is maximized For all ,      We are now optimizing a quadratic function subject to linear constraints. Quadratic optimization problems are a standard, well-known class of mathematical optimization problems, and many algorithms exist for solving them. We could in principle build our SVM using standard quadratic programming (QP) libraries, but there has been much recent research in this area aiming to exploit the structure of the kind of QP that emerges from an SVM. As a result, there are more intricate but much faster and more scalable libraries available especially for building SVMs, which almost everyone uses to build models. We will not present the details of such algorithms here. However, it will be helpful to what follows to understand the shape of the solution of such an optimization problem. The solution involves constructing a dual problem where a Lagrange multiplier is associated with each constraint in the primal problem: The solution is then of the form: In the solution, most of the are zero. Each non-zero indicates that the corresponding is a support vector. The classification function is then: (170)  dot product     To recap, we start with a training data set. The data set uniquely defines the best separating hyperplane, and we feed the data through a quadratic optimization procedure to find this plane. Given a new point to classify, the classification function in either Equation 165 or Equation 170 is computing the projection of the point onto the hyperplane normal. The sign of this function determines the class to assign to the point. If the point is within the margin of the classifier (or another confidence threshold that we might have determined to minimize classification mistakes) then the classifier can return ``don't know'' rather than one of the two classes. The value of may also be transformed into a probability of classification; fitting a sigmoid to transform the values is standard (Platt, 2000). Also, since the margin is constant, if the model includes dimensions from various sources, careful rescaling of some dimensions may be required. However, this is not a problem if our documents (points) are on the unit hypersphere.  Figure 15.4: A tiny 3 data point training set for an SVM. Worked example. Consider building an SVM over the (very little) data set shown in Figure 15.4 . Working geometrically, for an example like this, the maximum margin weight vector will be parallel to the shortest line connecting points of the two classes, that is, the line between and , giving a weight vector of . The optimal decision surface is orthogonal to that line and intersects it at the halfway point. Therefore, it passes through . So, the SVM decision boundary is: (171)  Working algebraically, with the standard constraint that , we seek to minimize . This happens when this constraint is satisfied with equality by the two support vectors. Further we know that the solution is for some . So we have that:         The margin is . This answer can be confirmed geometrically by examining Figure 15.4 . End worked example. Exercises. What is the minimum number of support vectors that there can be for a data set (which contains instances of each class)? The basis of being able to use kernels in SVMs (see Section 15.2.3 ) is that the classification function can be written in the form of Equation 170 (where, for large problems, most are 0). Show explicitly how the classification function could be written in this form for the data set from small-svm-eg. That is, write as a function where the data points appear and the only variable is . Install an SVM package such as SVMlight (http://svmlight.joachims.org/), and build an SVM for the data set discussed in small-svm-eg. Confirm that the program gives the same solution as the text. For SVMlight, or another package that accepts the same training data format, the training file would be: 1 1:2 2:3 1 1:2 2:0 1 1:1 2:1 The training command for SVMlight is then: svm_learn -c 1 -a alphas.dat train.dat model.dat The -c 1 option is needed to turn off use of the slack variables that we discuss in Section 15.2.1 . Check that the norm of the weight vector agrees with what we found in small-svm-eg. Examine the file alphas.dat which contains the values, and check that they agree with your answers in Exercise 15.1 .

  <TEXT>
   Soft margin classification For the very high dimensional problems common in text classification, sometimes the data are linearly separable. But in the general case they are not, and even if they are, we might prefer a solution that better separates the bulk of the data while ignoring a few weird noise documents.  Figure 15.5: Large margin classification with slack variables. If the training set is not linearly separable, the standard approach is to allow the fat decision margin to make a few mistakes (some points - outliers or noisy examples - are inside or on the wrong side of the margin). We then pay a cost for each misclassified example, which depends on how far it is from meeting the margin requirement given in Equation 169. To implement this, we introduce slack variables . A non-zero value for allows to not meet the margin requirement at a cost proportional to the value of . See Figure 15.5 . The formulation of the SVM optimization problem with slack variables is: The optimization problem is then trading off how fat it can make the margin versus how many points have to be moved around to allow this margin. The margin can be less than 1 for a point by setting , but then one pays a penalty of in the minimization for having done that. The sum of the gives an upper bound on the number of training errors. Soft-margin SVMs minimize training error traded off against margin. The parameter is a regularization term, which provides a way to control overfitting: as becomes large, it is unattractive to not respect the data at the cost of reducing the geometric margin; when it is small, it is easy to account for some data points with the use of slack variables and to have a fat margin placed so it models the bulk of the data. The dual problem for soft margin classification becomes: Neither the slack variables nor Lagrange multipliers for them appear in the dual problem. All we are left with is the constant bounding the possible size of the Lagrange multipliers for the support vector data points. As before, the with non-zero will be the support vectors. The solution of the dual problem is of the form: Again is not needed explicitly for classification, which can be done in terms of dot products with data points, as in Equation 170. Typically, the support vectors will be a small proportion of the training data. However, if the problem is non-separable or with small margin, then every data point which is misclassified or within the margin will have a non-zero . If this set of points becomes large, then, for the nonlinear case which we turn to in Section 15.2.3 , this can be a major slowdown for using SVMs at test time.

The complexity of training and testing with linear SVMs is shown in Table 15.1 . The time for training an SVM is dominated by the time for solving the underlying QP, and so the theoretical and empirical complexity varies depending on the method used to solve it. The standard result for solving QPs is that it takes time cubic in the size of the data set (Kozlov et al., 1979). All the recent work on SVM training has worked to reduce that complexity, often by being satisfied with approximate solutions. Standardly, empirical complexity is about (Joachims, 2006a). Nevertheless, the super-linear training time of traditional SVM algorithms makes them difficult or impossible to use on very large training data sets. Alternative traditional SVM solution algorithms which are linear in the number of training examples scale badly with a large number of features, which is another standard attribute of text problems. However, a new training algorithm based on cutting plane techniques gives a promising answer to this issue by having running time linear in the number of training examples and the number of non-zero features in examples (Joachims, 2006a). Nevertheless, the actual speed of doing quadratic optimization remains much slower than simply counting terms as is done in a Naive Bayes model. Extending SVM algorithms to nonlinear SVMs, as in the next section, standardly increases training complexity by a factor of (since dot products between examples need to be calculated), making them impractical. In practice it can often be cheaper to materialize the higher-order features and to train a linear SVM.

  <TITLE>15.2.2 Multiclass SVMs</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Multiclass SVMs SVMs are inherently two-class classifiers. The traditional way to do multiclass classification with SVMs is to use one of the methods discussed in Section 14.5 (page 14.5 ). In particular, the most common technique in practice has been to build one-versus-rest classifiers (commonly referred to as ``one-versus-all'' or OVA classification), and to choose the class which classifies the test datum with greatest margin. Another strategy is to build a set of one-versus-one classifiers, and to choose the class that is selected by the most classifiers. While this involves building classifiers, the time for training classifiers may actually decrease, since the training data set for each classifier is much smaller. However, these are not very elegant approaches to solving multiclass problems. A better alternative is provided by the construction of multiclass SVMs, where we build a two-class classifier over a feature vector derived from the pair consisting of the input features and the class of the datum. At test time, the classifier chooses the class . The margin during training is the gap between this value for the correct class and for the nearest other class, and so the quadratic program formulation will require that . This general method can be extended to give a multiclass formulation of various kinds of linear classifiers. It is also a simple instance of a generalization of classification where the classes are not just a set of independent, categorical labels, but may be arbitrary structured objects with relationships defined between them. In the SVM world, such work comes under the label of structural SVMs . We mention them again in Section 15.4.2 .

   Nonlinear SVMs  Figure 15.6: Projecting data that is not linearly separable into a higher dimensional space can make it linearly separable. With what we have presented so far, data sets that are linearly separable (perhaps with a few exceptions or some noise) are well-handled. But what are we going to do if the data set just doesn't allow classification by a linear classifier? Let us look at a one-dimensional case. The top data set in Figure 15.6 is straightforwardly classified by a linear classifier but the middle data set is not. We instead need to be able to pick out an interval. One way to solve this problem is to map the data on to a higher dimensional space and then to use a linear classifier in the higher dimensional space. For example, the bottom part of the figure shows that a linear separator can easily classify the data if we use a quadratic function to map the data into two dimensions (a polar coordinates projection would be another possibility). The general idea is to map the original feature space to some higher-dimensional feature space where the training set is separable. Of course, we would want to do so in ways that preserve relevant dimensions of relatedness between data points, so that the resultant classifier should still generalize well. SVMs, and also a number of other linear classifiers, provide an easy and efficient way of doing this mapping to a higher dimensional space, which is referred to as ``the kernel trick ''. It's not really a trick: it just exploits the math that we have seen. The SVM linear classifier relies on a dot product between data point vectors. Let . Then the classifier we have seen so far is: (172)      172  kernel function  Worked example. The quadratic kernel in two dimensions.quad-kernel For 2-dimensional vectors , , consider . We wish to show that this is a kernel, i.e., that for some . Consider . Then: (173)   (174)   (175)   (176)   End worked example. In the language of functional analysis, what kinds of functions are valid kernel functions ? Kernel functions are sometimes more precisely referred to as Mercer kernels , because they must satisfy Mercer's condition: for any such that is finite, we must have that: (177)     15.5 The two commonly used families of kernels are polynomial kernels and radial basis functions. Polynomial kernels are of the form . The case of is a linear kernel, which is what we had before the start of this section (the constant 1 just changing the threshold). The case of gives a quadratic kernel, and is very commonly used. We illustrated the quadratic kernel in quad-kernel. The most common form of radial basis function is a Gaussian distribution, calculated as: (178)  15.5 The world of SVMs comes with its own language, which is rather different from the language otherwise used in machine learning. The terminology does have deep roots in mathematics, but it's important not to be too awed by that terminology. Really, we are talking about some quite simple things. A polynomial kernel allows us to model feature conjunctions (up to the order of the polynomial). That is, if we want to be able to model occurrences of pairs of words, which give distinctive information about topic classification, not given by the individual words alone, like perhaps operating and system or ethnic and cleansing, then we need to use a quadratic kernel. If occurrences of triples of words give distinctive information, then we need to use a cubic kernel. Simultaneously you also get the powers of the basic features - for most text applications, that probably isn't useful, but just comes along with the math and hopefully doesn't do harm. A radial basis function allows you to have features that pick out circles (hyperspheres) - although the decision boundaries become much more complex as multiple such features interact. A string kernel lets you have features that are character subsequences of terms. All of these are straightforward notions which have also been used in many other places under different names.

This was one of several pieces of work from this time that established the strong reputation of SVMs for text classification. Another pioneering work on scaling and evaluating SVMs for text classification was (Joachims, 1998). We present some of his results from (Joachims, 2002a) in Table 15.2 .Joachims used a large number of term features in contrast to Dumais et al. (1998), who used MI feature selection (Section 13.5.1 , page 13.5.1 ) to build classifiers with a much more limited number of features. The success of the linear SVM mirrors the results discussed in Section 14.6 (page ) on other linear approaches like Naive Bayes. It seems that working with simple term features can get one a long way. It is again noticeable the extent to which different papers' results for the same machine learning methods differ. In particular, based on replications by other researchers, the Naive Bayes results of (Joachims, 1998) appear too weak, and the results in Table 13.9 should be taken as representative.

  <TITLE>15.3 Issues in the classification of text documents</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Issues in the classification of text documents There are lots of applications of text classification in the commercial world; email spam filtering is perhaps now the most ubiquitous. Jackson and Moulinier (2002) write: ``There is no question concerning the commercial value of being able to classify documents automatically by content. There are myriad potential applications of such a capability for corporate Intranets, government departments, and Internet publishers.'' Most of our discussion of classification has focused on introducing various machine learning methods rather than discussing particular features of text documents relevant to classification. This bias is appropriate for a textbook, but is misplaced for an application developer. It is frequently the case that greater performance gains can be achieved from exploiting domain-specific text features than from changing from one machine learning method to another. Jackson and Moulinier (2002) suggest that ``Understanding the data is one of the keys to successful categorization, yet this is an area in which most categorization tool vendors are extremely weak. Many of the `one size fits all' tools on the market have not been tested on a wide range of content types.'' In this section we wish to step back a little and consider the applications of text classification, the space of possible solutions, and the utility of application-specific heuristics.

  <TITLE>15.3.1 Choosing what kind of classifier to use</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Choosing what kind of classifier to use When confronted with a need to build a text classifier, the first question to ask is how much training data is there currently available? None? Very little? Quite a lot? Or a huge amount, growing every day? Often one of the biggest practical challenges in fielding a machine learning classifier in real applications is creating or obtaining enough training data. For many problems and algorithms, hundreds or thousands of examples from each class are required to produce a high performance classifier and many real world contexts involve large sets of categories. We will initially assume that the classifier is needed as soon as possible; if a lot of time is available for implementation, much of it might be spent on assembling data resources. If you have no labeled training data, and especially if there are existing staff knowledgeable about the domain of the data, then you should never forget the solution of using hand-written rules. That is, you write standing queries, as we touched on at the beginning of Chapter 13 . For example: if (wheat or grain) and not (whole or bread) then Jacobs and Rau (1990) Hayes and Weinstein (1990)  13.4 If you have fairly little data and you are going to train a supervised classifier, then machine learning theory says you should stick to a classifier with high bias, as we discussed in Section 14.6 (page ). For example, there are theoretical and empirical results that Naive Bayes does well in such circumstances (Forman and Cohen, 2004, Ng and Jordan, 2001), although this effect is not necessarily observed in practice with regularized models over textual data (Klein and Manning, 2002). At any rate, a very low bias model like a nearest neighbor model is probably counterindicated. Regardless, the quality of the model will be adversely affected by the limited training data. Here, the theoretically interesting answer is to try to apply semi-supervised training methods . This includes methods such as bootstrapping or the EM algorithm, which we will introduce in Section 16.5 (page ). In these methods, the system gets some labeled documents, and a further large supply of unlabeled documents over which it can attempt to learn. One of the big advantages of Naive Bayes is that it can be straightforwardly extended to be a semi-supervised learning algorithm, but for SVMs, there is also semi-supervised learning work which goes under the title of transductive SVMs . See the references for pointers. Often, the practical answer is to work out how to get more labeled data as quickly as you can. The best way to do this is to insert yourself into a process where humans will be willing to label data for you as part of their natural tasks. For example, in many cases humans will sort or route email for their own purposes, and these actions give information about classes. The alternative of getting human labelers expressly for the task of training classifiers is often difficult to organize, and the labeling is often of lower quality, because the labels are not embedded in a realistic task context. Rather than getting people to label all or a random sample of documents, there has also been considerable research on active learning , where a system is built which decides which documents a human should label. Usually these are the ones on which a classifier is uncertain of the correct classification. This can be effective in reducing annotation costs by a factor of 2-4, but has the problem that the good documents to label to train one type of classifier often are not the good documents to label to train a different type of classifier. If there is a reasonable amount of labeled data, then you are in the perfect position to use everything that we have presented about text classification. For instance, you may wish to use an SVM. However, if you are deploying a linear classifier such as an SVM, you should probably design an application that overlays a Boolean rule-based classifier over the machine learning classifier. Users frequently like to adjust things that do not come out quite right, and if management gets on the phone and wants the classification of a particular document fixed right now, then this is much easier to do by hand-writing a rule than by working out how to adjust the weights of an SVM without destroying the overall classification accuracy. This is one reason why machine learning models like decision trees which produce user-interpretable Boolean-like models retain considerable popularity. If a huge amount of data are available, then the choice of classifier probably has little effect on your results and the best choice may be unclear (cf. Banko and Brill, 2001). It may be best to choose a classifier based on the scalability of training or even runtime efficiency. To get to this point, you need to have huge amounts of data. The general rule of thumb is that each doubling of the training data size produces a linear increase in classifier performance, but with very large amounts of data, the improvement becomes sub-linear.

  <TITLE>15.4 Machine learning methods in ad hoc information retrieval</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Machine learning methods in ad hoc information retrieval Rather than coming up with term and document weighting functions by hand, as we primarily did in Chapter 6 , we can view different sources of relevance signal (cosine score, title match, etc.) as features in a learning problem. A classifier that has been fed examples of relevant and nonrelevant documents for each of a set of queries can then figure out the relative weights of these signals. If we configure the problem so that there are pairs of a document and a query which are assigned a relevance judgment of relevant or nonrelevant, then we can think of this problem too as a text classification problem. Taking such a classification approach is not necessarily best, and we present an alternative in Section 15.4.2 . Nevertheless, given the material we have covered, the simplest place to start is to approach this problem as a classification problem, by ordering the documents according to the confidence of a two-class classifier in its relevance decision. And this move is not purely pedagogical; exactly this approach is sometimes used in practice.   Subsections A simple example of machine-learned scoring Result ranking by machine learning

  <TITLE>15.4.1 A simple example of machine-learned scoring</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   A simple example of machine-learned scoring In this section we generalize the methodology of Section 6.1.2 (page ) to machine learning of the scoring function. In Section 6.1.2 we considered a case where we had to combine Boolean indicators of relevance; here we consider more general factors to further develop the notion of machine-learned relevance . In particular, the factors we now consider go beyond Boolean functions of query term presence in document zones, as in Section 6.1.2 . We develop the ideas in a setting where the scoring function is a linear combination of two factors: (1) the vector space cosine similarity between query and document and (2) the minimum window width within which the query terms lie. As we noted in Section 7.2.2 (page ), query term proximity is often very indicative of a document being on topic, especially with longer documents and on the web. Among other things, this quantity gives us an implementation of implicit phrases. Thus we have one factor that depends on the statistics of query terms in the document as a bag of words, and another that depends on proximity weighting. We consider only two features in the development of the ideas because a two-feature exposition remains simple enough to visualize. The technique can be generalized to many more features. As in Section 6.1.2 , we are provided with a set of training examples, each of which is a pair consisting of a query and a document, together with a relevance judgment for that document on that query that is either relevant or nonrelevant. For each such example we can compute the vector space cosine similarity, as well as the window width . The result is a training set as shown in Table 15.3 , which resembles Figure 6.5 (page ) from Section 6.1.2 .   Table 15.3: Training examples for machine-learned scoring. Example DocID Query Cosine score Judgment 37 linux operating system 0.032 3 relevant 37 penguin logo 0.02 4 nonrelevant 238 operating system 0.043 2 relevant 238 runtime environment 0.004 2 nonrelevant 1741 kernel layer 0.022 3 relevant 2094 device driver 0.03 2 relevant 3191 device driver 0.027 5 nonrelevant   Here, the two features (cosine score denoted and window width ) are real-valued predictors. If we once again quantify the judgment relevant as 1 and nonrelevant as 0, we seek a scoring function that combines the values of the features to generate a value that is (close to) 0 or 1. We wish this function to be in agreement with our set of training examples as far as possible. Without loss of generality, a linear classifier will use a linear combination of features of the form (179)   6.1.2 179 15.3   15.7  A collection of training examples.Each R denotes a training example labeled relevant, while each N is a training example labeled nonrelevant. In this setting, the function from Equation 179 represents a plane ``hanging above'' Figure 15.7 . Ideally this plane (in the direction perpendicular to the page containing Figure 15.7 ) assumes values close to 1 above the points marked R, and values close to 0 above the points marked N. Since a plane is unlikely to assume only values close to 0 or 1 above the training sample points, we make use of thresholding: given any query and document for which we wish to determine relevance, we pick a value and if we declare the document to be relevant, else we declare the document to be nonrelevant. As we know from Figure 14.8 (page ), all points that satisfy form a line (shown as a dashed line in Figure 15.7 ) and we thus have a linear classifier that separates relevant from nonrelevant instances. Geometrically, we can find the separating line as follows. Consider the line passing through the plane whose height is above the page containing Figure 15.7 . Project this line down onto Figure 15.7 ; this will be the dashed line in Figure 15.7 . Then, any subsequent query/document pair that falls below the dashed line in Figure 15.7 is deemed nonrelevant; above the dashed line, relevant. Thus, the problem of making a binary relevant/nonrelevant judgment given training examples as above turns into one of learning the dashed line in Figure 15.7 separating relevant training examples from the nonrelevant ones. Being in the - plane, this line can be written as a linear equation involving and , with two parameters (slope and intercept). The methods of linear classification that we have already looked at in classificationsvm provide methods for choosing this line. Provided we can build a sufficiently rich collection of training samples, we can thus altogether avoid hand-tuning score functions as in Section 7.2.3 (page ). The bottleneck of course is the ability to maintain a suitably representative set of training examples, whose relevance assessments must be made by experts.

  <TITLE>15.4.2 Result ranking by machine learning</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Result ranking by machine learning The above ideas can be readily generalized to functions of many more than two variables. There are lots of other scores that are indicative of the relevance of a document to a query, including static quality (PageRank-style measures, discussed in Chapter 21 ), document age, zone contributions, document length, and so on. Providing that these measures can be calculated for a training document collection with relevance judgments, any number of such measures can be used to train a machine learning classifier. For instance, we could train an SVM over binary relevance judgments, and order documents based on their probability of relevance, which is monotonic with the documents' signed distance from the decision boundary. However, approaching IR result ranking like this is not necessarily the right way to think about the problem. Statisticians normally first divide problems into classification problems (where a categorical variable is predicted) versus regression problems (where a real number is predicted). In between is the specialized field of ordinal regression where a ranking is predicted. Machine learning for ad hoc retrieval is most properly thought of as an ordinal regression problem, where the goal is to rank a set of documents for a query, given training data of the same sort. This formulation gives some additional power, since documents can be evaluated relative to other candidate documents for the same query, rather than having to be mapped to a global scale of goodness, while also weakening the problem space, since just a ranking is required rather than an absolute measure of relevance. Issues of ranking are especially germane in web search, where the ranking at the very top of the results list is exceedingly important, whereas decisions of relevance of a document to a query may be much less important. Such work can and has been pursued using the structural SVM framework which we mentioned in Section 15.2.2 , where the class being predicted is a ranking of results for a query, but here we will present the slightly simpler ranking SVM. The construction of a ranking SVM proceeds as follows. We begin with a set of judged queries. For each training query , we have a set of documents returned in response to the query, which have been totally ordered by a person for relevance to the query. We construct a vector of features for each document/query pair, using features such as those discussed in Section 15.4.1 , and many more. For two documents and , we then form the vector of feature differences: (180)  By hypothesis, one of and has been judged more relevant. If is judged more relevant than , denoted ( should precede in the results ordering), then we will assign the vector the class ; otherwise . The goal then is to build a classifier which will return (181)       Both of the methods that we have just looked at use a linear weighting of document features that are indicators of relevance, as has most work in this area. It is therefore perhaps interesting to note that much of traditional IR weighting involves nonlinear scaling of basic measurements (such as log-weighting of term frequency, or idf). At the present time, machine learning is very good at producing optimal weights for features in a linear combination (or other similar restricted model classes), but it is not good at coming up with good nonlinear scalings of basic measurements. This area remains the domain of human feature engineering. The idea of learning ranking functions has been around for a number of years, but it is only very recently that sufficient machine learning knowledge, training document collections, and computational power have come together to make this method practical and exciting. It is thus too early to write something definitive on machine learning approaches to ranking in information retrieval, but there is every reason to expect the use and importance of machine learned ranking approaches to grow over time. While skilled humans can do a very good job at defining ranking functions by hand, hand tuning is difficult, and it has to be done again for each new document collection and class of users. Exercises. Plot the first 7 rows of Table 15.3 in the - plane to produce a figure like that in Figure 15.7 . Write down the equation of a line in the - plane separating the Rs from the Ns. Give a training example (consisting of values for and the relevance judgment) that when added to the training set makes it impossible to separate the R's from the N's using a line in the - plane.

   References and further reading The somewhat quirky name support vector machine originates in the neural networks literature, where learning algorithms were thought of as architectures, and often referred to as ``machines''. The distinctive element of this model is that the decision boundary to use is completely decided (``supported'') by a few training data points, the support vectors. For a more detailed presentation of SVMs, a good, well-known article-length introduction is (Burges, 1998). Chen et al. (2005) introduce the more recent -SVM, which provides an alternative parameterization for dealing with inseparable problems, whereby rather than specifying a penalty , you specify a parameter which bounds the number of examples which can appear on the wrong side of the decision surface. There are now also several books dedicated to SVMs, large margin learning, and kernels: (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) and (Schölkopf and Smola, 2001) are more mathematically oriented, while (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) aims to be more practical. For the foundations by their originator, see (Vapnik, 1998). Some recent, more general books on statistical learning, such as (Hastie et al., 2001) also give thorough coverage of SVMs. The construction of multiclass SVMs is discussed in (Weston and Watkins, 1999), (Crammer and Singer, 2001), and (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005). The last reference provides an introduction to the general framework of structural SVMs. The kernel trick was first presented in (Aizerman et al., 1964). For more about string kernels and other kernels for structured data, see (Lodhi et al., 2002) and (Gaertner et al., 2002). The Advances in Neural Information Processing (NIPS) conferences have become the premier venue for theoretical machine learning work, such as on SVMs. Other venues such as SIGIR are much stronger on experimental methodology and using text-specific features to improve classifier effectiveness. A recent comparison of most current machine learning classifiers (though on problems rather different from typical text problems) can be found in (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006). (Li and Yang, 2003), discussed in Section 13.6 , is the most recent comparative evaluation of machine learning classifiers on text classification. Older examinations of classifiers on text problems can be found in (Yang and Liu, 1999, Dumais et al., 1998, Yang, 1999). Joachims (2002a) presents his work on SVMs applied to text problems in detail. Zhang and Oles (2001) present an insightful comparison of Naive Bayes, regularized logistic regression and SVM classifiers. Joachims (1999) discusses methods of making SVM learning practical over large text data sets. Joachims (2006a) improves on this work. A number of approaches to hierarchical classification have been developed in order to deal with the common situation where the classes to be assigned have a natural hierarchical organization (Weigend et al., 1999, Dumais and Chen, 2000, Koller and Sahami, 1997, McCallum et al., 1998). In a recent large study on scaling SVMs to the entire Yahoo! directory, Liu et al. (2005) conclude that hierarchical classification noticeably if still modestly outperforms flat classification. Classifier effectiveness remains limited by the very small number of training documents for many classes. For a more general approach that can be applied to modeling relations between classes, which may be arbitrary rather than simply the case of a hierarchy, see Tsochantaridis et al. (2005). Moschitti and Basili (2004) investigate the use of complex nominals, proper nouns and word senses as features in text classification. Dietterich (2002) overviews ensemble methods for classifier combination, while Schapire (2003) focuses particularly on boosting, which is applied to text classification in (Schapire and Singer, 2000). Chapelle et al. (2006) present an introduction to work in semi-supervised methods, including in particular chapters on using EM for semi-supervised text classification (Nigam et al., 2006) and on transductive SVMs (Joachims, 2006b). Sindhwani and Keerthi (2006) present a more efficient implementation of a transductive SVM for large data sets. Tong and Koller (2001) explore active learning with SVMs for text classification; Baldridge and Osborne (2004) point out that examples selected for annotation with one classifier in an active learning context may be no better than random examples when used with another classifier. Machine learning approaches to ranking for ad hoc retrieval were pioneered in (Wong et al., 1988), (Fuhr, 1992), and (Gey, 1994). But limited training data and poor machine learning techniques meant that these pieces of work achieved only middling results, and hence they only had limited impact at the time. Taylor et al. (2006) study using machine learning to tune the parameters of the BM25 family of ranking functions okapi-bm25 so as to maximize NDCG (Section 8.4 , page 8.4 ). Machine learning approaches to ordinal regression appear in (Herbrich et al., 2000) and (Burges et al., 2005), and are applied to clickstream data in (Joachims, 2002b). Cao et al. (2006) study how to make this approach effective in IR, and Qin et al. (2007) suggest an extension involving using multiple hyperplanes. Yue et al. (2007) study how to do ranking with a structural SVM approach, and in particular show how this construction can be effectively used to directly optimize for MAP ranked-evaluation, rather than using surrogate measures like accuracy or area under the ROC curve. Geng et al. (2007) study feature selection for the ranking problem. Other approaches to learning to rank have also been shown to be effective for web search, such as (Richardson et al., 2006, Burges et al., 2005).

  <TITLE>Chapter 16 Flat clustering</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Flat clustering Clustering algorithms group a set of documents into subsets or clusters . The algorithms' goal is to create clusters that are coherent internally, but clearly different from each other. In other words, documents within a cluster should be as similar as possible; and documents in one cluster should be as dissimilar as possible from documents in other clusters.  Figure 16.1: An example of a data set with a clear cluster structure. Clustering is the most common form of unsupervised learning . No supervision means that there is no human expert who has assigned documents to classes. In clustering, it is the distribution and makeup of the data that will determine cluster membership. A simple example is Figure 16.1 . It is visually clear that there are three distinct clusters of points. This chapter and Chapter 17 introduce algorithms that find such clusters in an unsupervised fashion. The difference between clustering and classification may not seem great at first. After all, in both cases we have a partition of a set of documents into groups. But as we will see the two problems are fundamentally different. Classification is a form of supervised learning (Chapter 13 , page 13.1 ): our goal is to replicate a categorical distinction that a human supervisor imposes on the data. In unsupervised learning, of which clustering is the most important example, we have no such teacher to guide us. The key input to a clustering algorithm is the distance measure. In Figure 16.1 , the distance measure is distance in the 2D plane. This measure suggests three different clusters in the figure. In document clustering, the distance measure is often also Euclidean distance. Different distance measures give rise to different clusterings. Thus, the distance measure is an important means by which we can influence the outcome of clustering. Flat clustering creates a flat set of clusters without any explicit structure that would relate clusters to each other. Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters and will be covered in Chapter 17 . Chapter 17 also addresses the difficult problem of labeling clusters automatically. A second important distinction can be made between hard and soft clustering algorithms. Hard clustering computes a hard assignment - each document is a member of exactly one cluster. The assignment of soft clustering algorithms is soft - a document's assignment is a distribution over all clusters. In a soft assignment, a document has fractional membership in several clusters. Latent semantic indexing, a form of dimensionality reduction, is a soft clustering algorithm (Chapter 18 , page 18.4 ). This chapter motivates the use of clustering in information retrieval by introducing a number of applications (Section 16.1 ), defines the problem we are trying to solve in clustering (Section 16.2 ) and discusses measures for evaluating cluster quality (Section 16.3 ). It then describes two flat clustering algorithms, -means (Section 16.4 ), a hard clustering algorithm, and the Expectation-Maximization (or EM) algorithm (Section 16.5 ), a soft clustering algorithm. -means is perhaps the most widely used flat clustering algorithm due to its simplicity and efficiency. The EM algorithm is a generalization of -means and can be applied to a large variety of document representations and distributions.

   Clustering in information retrieval  cluster hypothesis Cluster hypothesis. Documents in the same cluster behave similarly with respect to relevance to information needs. 14 14   Table 16.1: Some applications of clustering in information retrieval. Application What is Benefit Example   clustered?     Search result clustering search results more effective information presentation to user Figure 16.2 Scatter-Gather (subsets of) collection alternative user interface: ``search without typing'' Figure 16.3 Collection clustering collection effective information presentation for exploratory browsing McKeown et al. (2002), http://news.google.com Language modeling collection increased precision and/or recall Liu and Croft (2004) Cluster-based retrieval collection higher efficiency: faster search Salton (1971a)   Table 16.1 shows some of the main applications of clustering in information retrieval. They differ in the set of documents that they cluster - search results, collection or subsets of the collection - and the aspect of an information retrieval system they try to improve - user experience, user interface, effectiveness or efficiency of the search system. But they are all based on the basic assumption stated by the cluster hypothesis.  Clustering of search results to improve recall. None of the top hits cover the animal sense of jaguar, but users can easily access it by clicking on the cat cluster in the Clustered Results panel on the left (third arrow from the top). The first application mentioned in Table 16.1 is search result clustering where by search results we mean the documents that were returned in response to a query. The default presentation of search results in information retrieval is a simple list. Users scan the list from top to bottom until they have found the information they are looking for. Instead, search result clustering clusters the search results, so that similar documents appear together. It is often easier to scan a few coherent groups than many individual documents. This is particularly useful if a search term has different word senses. The example in Figure 16.2 is jaguar. Three frequent senses on the web refer to the car, the animal and an Apple operating system. The Clustered Results panel returned by the Vivísimo search engine (http://vivisimo.com) can be a more effective user interface for understanding what is in the search results than a simple list of documents.  An example of a user session in Scatter-Gather. A collection of New York Times news stories is clustered (``scattered'') into eight clusters (top row). The user manually gathers three of these into a smaller collection International Stories and performs another scattering operation. This process repeats until a small cluster with relevant documents is found (e.g., Trinidad). A better user interface is also the goal of Scatter-Gather , the second application in Table 16.1 . Scatter-Gather clusters the whole collection to get groups of documents that the user can select or gather. The selected groups are merged and the resulting set is again clustered. This process is repeated until a cluster of interest is found. An example is shown in Figure 16.3 . Automatically generated clusters like those in Figure 16.3 are not as neatly organized as a manually constructed hierarchical tree like the Open Directory at http://dmoz.org. Also, finding descriptive labels for clusters automatically is a difficult problem (Section 17.7 , page 17.7 ). But cluster-based navigation is an interesting alternative to keyword searching, the standard information retrieval paradigm. This is especially true in scenarios where users prefer browsing over searching because they are unsure about which search terms to use. As an alternative to the user-mediated iterative clustering in Scatter-Gather, we can also compute a static hierarchical clustering of a collection that is not influenced by user interactions (``Collection clustering'' in Table 16.1 ). Google News and its precursor, the Columbia NewsBlaster system, are examples of this approach. In the case of news, we need to frequently recompute the clustering to make sure that users can access the latest breaking stories. Clustering is well suited for access to a collection of news stories since news reading is not really search, but rather a process of selecting a subset of stories about recent events. The fourth application of clustering exploits the cluster hypothesis directly for improving search results, based on a clustering of the entire collection. We use a standard inverted index to identify an initial set of documents that match the query, but we then add other documents from the same clusters even if they have low similarity to the query. For example, if the query is car and several car documents are taken from a cluster of automobile documents, then we can add documents from this cluster that use terms other than car (automobile, vehicle etc). This can increase recall since a group of documents with high mutual similarity is often relevant as a whole. More recently this idea has been used for language modeling. Equation 102 , page 102 , showed that to avoid sparse data problems in the language modeling approach to IR, the model of document can be interpolated with a collection model. But the collection contains many documents with terms untypical of . By replacing the collection model with a model derived from 's cluster, we get more accurate estimates of the occurrence probabilities of terms in . Clustering can also speed up search. As we saw in Section 6.3.2 ( page 6.3.2 ) search in the vector space model amounts to finding the nearest neighbors to the query. The inverted index supports fast nearest-neighbor search for the standard IR setting. However, sometimes we may not be able to use an inverted index efficiently, e.g., in latent semantic indexing (Chapter 18 ). In such cases, we could compute the similarity of the query to every document, but this is slow. The cluster hypothesis offers an alternative: Find the clusters that are closest to the query and only consider documents from these clusters. Within this much smaller set, we can compute similarities exhaustively and rank documents in the usual way. Since there are many fewer clusters than documents, finding the closest cluster is fast; and since the documents matching a query are all similar to each other, they tend to be in the same clusters. While this algorithm is inexact, the expected decrease in search quality is small. This is essentially the application of clustering that was covered in Section 7.1.6 (page 7.1.6 ). Exercises. Define two documents as similar if they have at least two proper names like Clinton or Sarkozy in common. Give an example of an information need and two documents, for which the cluster hypothesis does not hold for this notion of similarity. Make up a simple one-dimensional example (i.e. points on a line) with two clusters where the inexactness of cluster-based retrieval shows up. In your example, retrieving clusters close to the query should do worse than direct nearest neighbor search.

  <TITLE>16.2 Problem statement</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Problem statement     objective function    The objective function is often defined in terms of similarity or distance between documents. Below, we will see that the objective in -means clustering is to minimize the average distance between documents and their centroids or, equivalently, to maximize the similarity between documents and their centroids. The discussion of similarity measures and distance metrics in Chapter 14 (page 14.1 ) also applies to this chapter. As in Chapter 14 , we use both similarity and distance to talk about relatedness between documents. For documents, the type of similarity we want is usually topic similarity or high values on the same dimensions in the vector space model. For example, documents about China have high values on dimensions like Chinese, Beijing, and Mao whereas documents about the UK tend to have high values for London, Britain and Queen. We approximate topic similarity with cosine similarity or Euclidean distance in vector space (Chapter 6 ). If we intend to capture similarity of a type other than topic, for example, similarity of language, then a different representation may be appropriate. When computing topic similarity, stop words can be safely ignored, but they are important cues for separating clusters of English (in which the occurs frequently and la infrequently) and French documents (in which the occurs infrequently and la frequently).

   Cardinality - the number of clusters  cardinality       16.3  Since our goal is to optimize an objective function, clustering is essentially a search problem. The brute force solution would be to enumerate all possible clusterings and pick the best. However, there are exponentially many partitions, so this approach is not feasible. For this reason, most flat clustering algorithms refine an initial partitioning iteratively. If the search starts at an unfavorable initial point, we may miss the global optimum. Finding a good starting point is therefore another important problem we have to solve in flat clustering.

  <TITLE>16.3 Evaluation of clustering</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Evaluation of clustering Typical objective functions in clustering formalize the goal of attaining high intra-cluster similarity (documents within a cluster are similar) and low inter-cluster similarity (documents from different clusters are dissimilar). This is an internal criterion for the quality of a clustering. But good scores on an internal criterion do not necessarily translate into good effectiveness in an application. An alternative to internal criteria is direct evaluation in the application of interest. For search result clustering, we may want to measure the time it takes users to find an answer with different clustering algorithms. This is the most direct evaluation, but it is expensive, especially if large user studies are necessary. As a surrogate for user judgments, we can use a set of classes in an evaluation benchmark or gold standard (see Section 8.5 , page 8.5 , and Section 13.6 , page 13.6 ). The gold standard is ideally produced by human judges with a good level of inter-judge agreement (see Chapter 8 , page 8.1 ). We can then compute an external criterion that evaluates how well the clustering matches the gold standard classes. For example, we may want to say that the optimal clustering of the search results for jaguar in Figure 16.2 consists of three classes corresponding to the three senses car, animal, and operating system. In this type of evaluation, we only use the partition provided by the gold standard, not the class labels. This section introduces four external criteria of clustering quality. Purity is a simple and transparent evaluation measure. Normalized mutual information can be information-theoretically interpreted. The Rand index penalizes both false positive and false negative decisions during clustering. The F measure in addition supports differential weighting of these two types of errors.   To compute purity , each cluster is assigned to the class which is most frequent in the cluster, and then the accuracy of this assignment is measured by counting the number of correctly assigned documents and dividing by . Formally: (182)          182 We present an example of how to compute purity in Figure 16.4 . Bad clusterings have purity values close to 0, a perfect clustering has a purity of 1 . Purity is compared with the other three measures discussed in this chapter in Table 16.2 .   Table 16.2: The four external evaluation measures applied to the clustering in Figure 16.4 .   purity NMI RI lower bound 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 maximum 1 1 1 1 value for Figure 16.4 0.71 0.36 0.68 0.46   High purity is easy to achieve when the number of clusters is large - in particular, purity is 1 if each document gets its own cluster. Thus, we cannot use purity to trade off the quality of the clustering against the number of clusters. A measure that allows us to make this tradeoff is normalized mutual information or NMI : (183)    13 13.5.1  (184)   (185)          185 184 is entropy as defined in Chapter 5 (page 5.3.2 ): (186)   (187)   in Equation 184 measures the amount of information by which our knowledge about the classes increases when we are told what the clusters are. The minimum of is 0 if the clustering is random with respect to class membership. In that case, knowing that a document is in a particular cluster does not give us any new information about what its class might be. Maximum mutual information is reached for a clustering that perfectly recreates the classes - but also if clusters in are further subdivided into smaller clusters (Exercise 16.7 ). In particular, a clustering with one-document clusters has maximum MI. So MI has the same problem as purity: it does not penalize large cardinalities and thus does not formalize our bias that, other things being equal, fewer clusters are better. The normalization by the denominator in Equation 183 fixes this problem since entropy tends to increase with the number of clusters. For example, reaches its maximum for , which ensures that NMI is low for . Because NMI is normalized, we can use it to compare clusterings with different numbers of clusters. The particular form of the denominator is chosen because is a tight upper bound on (Exercise 16.7 ). Thus, NMI is always a number between 0 and 1. An alternative to this information-theoretic interpretation of clustering is to view it as a series of decisions, one for each of the pairs of documents in the collection. We want to assign two documents to the same cluster if and only if they are similar. A true positive (TP) decision assigns two similar documents to the same cluster, a true negative (TN) decision assigns two dissimilar documents to different clusters. There are two types of errors we can commit. A (FP) decision assigns two dissimilar documents to the same cluster. A (FN) decision assigns two similar documents to different clusters. The Rand index ( ) measures the percentage of decisions that are correct. That is, it is simply accuracy (Section 8.3 , page 8.3 ).     As an example, we compute RI for Figure 16.4 . We first compute . The three clusters contain 6, 6, and 5 points, respectively, so the total number of ``positives'' or pairs of documents that are in the same cluster is: (188)    (189)   and are computed similarly, resulting in the following contingency table:   Same cluster Different clusters Same class Different classes   The Rand index gives equal weight to false positives and false negatives. Separating similar documents is sometimes worse than putting pairs of dissimilar documents in the same cluster. We can use the F measure measuresperf to penalize false negatives more strongly than false positives by selecting a value , thus giving more weight to recall.            Exercises. Replace every point in Figure 16.4 with two identical copies of in the same class. (i) Is it less difficult, equally difficult or more difficult to cluster this set of 34 points as opposed to the 17 points in Figure 16.4 ? (ii) Compute purity, NMI, RI, and for the clustering with 34 points. Which measures increase and which stay the same after doubling the number of points? (iii) Given your assessment in (i) and the results in (ii), which measures are best suited to compare the quality of the two clusterings?

   K-means  6 6.4.4  centroid    (190)  The definition assumes that documents are represented as length-normalized vectors in a real-valued space in the familiar way. We used centroids for Rocchio classification in Chapter 14 (page 14.2 ). They play a similar role here. The ideal cluster in -means is a sphere with the centroid as its center of gravity. Ideally, the clusters should not overlap. Our desiderata for classes in Rocchio classification were the same. The difference is that we have no labeled training set in clustering for which we know which documents should be in the same cluster. A measure of how well the centroids represent the members of their clusters is the residual sum of squares or RSS , the squared distance of each vector from its centroid summed over all vectors:          (191)    objective function          seeds 16.5 16.6  17.2 17.2 We can apply one of the following termination conditions. A fixed number of iterations has been completed. This condition limits the runtime of the clustering algorithm, but in some cases the quality of the clustering will be poor because of an insufficient number of iterations. Assignment of documents to clusters (the partitioning function ) does not change between iterations. Except for cases with a bad local minimum, this produces a good clustering, but runtimes may be unacceptably long. Centroids do not change between iterations. This is equivalent to not changing (Exercise 16.4.1 ). Terminate when RSS falls below a threshold. This criterion ensures that the clustering is of a desired quality after termination. In practice, we need to combine it with a bound on the number of iterations to guarantee termination. Terminate when the decrease in RSS falls below a threshold . For small , this indicates that we are close to convergence. Again, we need to combine it with a bound on the number of iterations to prevent very long runtimes. We now show that -means converges by proving that monotonically decreases in each iteration. We will use decrease in the meaning decrease or does not change in this section. First, RSS decreases in the reassignment step since each vector is assigned to the closest centroid, so the distance it contributes to decreases. Second, it decreases in the recomputation step because the new centroid is the vector for which reaches its minimum. (192) (193)           (194)      Since there is only a finite set of possible clusterings, a monotonically decreasing algorithm will eventually arrive at a (local) minimum. Take care, however, to break ties consistently, e.g., by assigning a document to the cluster with the lowest index if there are several equidistant centroids. Otherwise, the algorithm can cycle forever in a loop of clusterings that have the same cost.   While this proves the convergence of -means, there is unfortunately no guarantee that a global minimum in the objective function will be reached. This is a particular problem if a document set contains many outliers , documents that are far from any other documents and therefore do not fit well into any cluster. Frequently, if an outlier is chosen as an initial seed, then no other vector is assigned to it during subsequent iterations. Thus, we end up with a singleton cluster (a cluster with only one document) even though there is probably a clustering with lower RSS. Figure 16.7 shows an example of a suboptimal clustering resulting from a bad choice of initial seeds. Another type of suboptimal clustering that frequently occurs is one with empty clusters (Exercise 16.7 ). Effective heuristics for seed selection include (i) excluding outliers from the seed set; (ii) trying out multiple starting points and choosing the clustering with lowest cost; and (iii) obtaining seeds from another method such as hierarchical clustering. Since deterministic hierarchical clustering methods are more predictable than -means, a hierarchical clustering of a small random sample of size (e.g., for or ) often provides good seeds (see the description of the Buckshot algorithm, Chapter 17 , page 17.8 ). Other initialization methods compute seeds that are not selected from the vectors to be clustered. A robust method that works well for a large variety of document distributions is to select (e.g., ) random vectors for each cluster and use their centroid as the seed for this cluster. See Section 16.6 for more sophisticated initializations. What is the time complexity of -means? Most of the time is spent on computing vector distances. One such operation costs . The reassignment step computes distances, so its overall complexity is . In the recomputation step, each vector gets added to a centroid once, so the complexity of this step is . For a fixed number of iterations , the overall complexity is therefore . Thus, -means is linear in all relevant factors: iterations, number of clusters, number of vectors and dimensionality of the space. This means that -means is more efficient than the hierarchical algorithms in Chapter 17 . We had to fix the number of iterations , which can be tricky in practice. But in most cases, -means quickly reaches either complete convergence or a clustering that is close to convergence. In the latter case, a few documents would switch membership if further iterations were computed, but this has a small effect on the overall quality of the clustering. There is one subtlety in the preceding argument. Even a linear algorithm can be quite slow if one of the arguments of is large, and usually is large. High dimensionality is not a problem for computing the distance between two documents. Their vectors are sparse, so that only a small fraction of the theoretically possible componentwise differences need to be computed. Centroids, however, are dense since they pool all terms that occur in any of the documents of their clusters. As a result, distance computations are time consuming in a naive implementation of -means. However, there are simple and effective heuristics for making centroid-document similarities as fast to compute as document-document similarities. Truncating centroids to the most significant terms (e.g., ) hardly decreases cluster quality while achieving a significant speedup of the reassignment step (see references in Section 16.6 ). The same efficiency problem is addressed by K-medoids , a variant of -means that computes medoids instead of centroids as cluster centers. We define the medoid of a cluster as the document vector that is closest to the centroid. Since medoids are sparse document vectors, distance computations are fast.  Estimated minimal residual sum of squares as a function of the number of clusters in -means. In this clustering of 1203 Reuters-RCV1 documents, there are two points where the curve flattens: at 4 clusters and at 9 clusters. The documents were selected from the categories China, Germany, Russia and Sports, so the clustering is closest to the Reuters classification.   Subsections Cluster cardinality in K-means

  <TEXT>
   Cluster cardinality in K-means 16.2   A naive approach would be to select the optimal value of according to the objective function, namely the value of that minimizes RSS. Defining as the minimal RSS of all clusterings with clusters, we observe that is a monotonically decreasing function in (Exercise 16.7 ), which reaches its minimum 0 for where is the number of documents. We would end up with each document being in its own cluster. Clearly, this is not an optimal clustering. A heuristic method that gets around this problem is to estimate as follows. We first perform (e.g., ) clusterings with clusters (each with a different initialization) and compute the RSS of each. Then we take the minimum of the RSS values. We denote this minimum by . Now we can inspect the values as increases and find the ``knee'' in the curve - the point where successive decreases in become noticeably smaller. There are two such points in Figure 16.8 , one at , where the gradient flattens slightly, and a clearer flattening at . This is typical: there is seldom a single best number of clusters. We still need to employ an external constraint to choose from a number of possible values of (4 and 9 in this case). A second type of criterion for cluster cardinality imposes a penalty for each new cluster - where conceptually we start with a single cluster containing all documents and then search for the optimal number of clusters by successively incrementing by one. To determine the cluster cardinality in this way, we create a generalized objective function that combines two elements: distortion , a measure of how much documents deviate from the prototype of their clusters (e.g., RSS for -means); and a measure of model complexity . We interpret a clustering here as a model of the data. Model complexity in clustering is usually the number of clusters or a function thereof. For -means, we then get this selection criterion for :     (195)       The obvious difficulty with Equation 195 is that we need to determine . Unless this is easier than determining directly, then we are back to square one. In some cases, we can choose values of that have worked well for similar data sets in the past. For example, if we periodically cluster news stories from a newswire, there is likely to be a fixed value of that gives us the right in each successive clustering. In this application, we would not be able to determine based on past experience since changes. A theoretical justification for Equation 195 is the Akaike Information Criterion or AIC, an information-theoretic measure that trades off distortion against model complexity. The general form of AIC is: (196)      For -means, the AIC can be stated as follows: (197)  197 195  To derive Equation 197 from Equation 196 observe that in -means since each element of the centroids is a parameter that can be varied independently; and that (modulo a constant) if we view the model underlying -means as a Gaussian mixture with hard assignment, uniform cluster priors and identical spherical covariance matrices (see Exercise 16.7 ). The derivation of AIC is based on a number of assumptions, e.g., that the data are . These assumptions are only approximately true for data sets in information retrieval. As a consequence, the AIC can rarely be applied without modification in text clustering. In Figure 16.8 , the dimensionality of the vector space is 50,000. Thus, dominates the smaller RSS-based term ( , not shown in the figure) and the minimum of the expression is reached for . But as we know, (corresponding to the four classes China, Germany, Russia and Sports) is a better choice than . In practice, Equation 195 is often more useful than Equation 197 - with the caveat that we need to come up with an estimate for . Exercises. Why are documents that do not use the same term for the concept car likely to end up in the same cluster in -means clustering? Two of the possible termination conditions for -means were (1) assignment does not change, (2) centroids do not change (page 16.4 ). Do these two conditions imply each other?

  <TITLE>16.5 Model-based clustering</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Model-based clustering In this section, we describe a generalization of -means, the EM algorithm. It can be applied to a larger variety of document representations and distributions than -means. In -means, we attempt to find centroids that are good representatives. We can view the set of centroids as a model that generates the data. Generating a document in this model consists of first picking a centroid at random and then adding some noise. If the noise is normally distributed, this procedure will result in clusters of spherical shape. Model-based clustering assumes that the data were generated by a model and tries to recover the original model from the data. The model that we recover from the data then defines clusters and an assignment of documents to clusters. A commonly used criterion for estimating the model parameters is maximum likelihood. In -means, the quantity is proportional to the likelihood that a particular model (i.e., a set of centroids) generated the data. For -means, maximum likelihood and minimal RSS are equivalent criteria. We denote the model parameters by . In -means, . More generally, the maximum likelihood criterion is to select the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood of generating the data : (198)    This is the same approach we took in Chapter 12 (page 12.1.1 ) for language modeling and in Section 13.1 (page 13.4 ) for text classification. In text classification, we chose the class that maximizes the likelihood of generating a particular document. Here, we choose the clustering that maximizes the likelihood of generating a given set of documents. Once we have , we can compute an assignment probability for each document-cluster pair. This set of assignment probabilities defines a soft clustering. An example of a soft assignment is that a document about Chinese cars may have a fractional membership of 0.5 in each of the two clusters China and automobiles, reflecting the fact that both topics are pertinent. A hard clustering like -means cannot model this simultaneous relevance to two topics. Model-based clustering provides a framework for incorporating our knowledge about a domain. -means and the hierarchical algorithms in Chapter 17 make fairly rigid assumptions about the data. For example, clusters in -means are assumed to be spheres. Model-based clustering offers more flexibility. The clustering model can be adapted to what we know about the underlying distribution of the data, be it Bernoulli (as in the example in Table 16.3 ), Gaussian with non-spherical variance (another model that is important in document clustering) or a member of a different family. A commonly used algorithm for model-based clustering is the Expectation-Maximization algorithm or EM algorithm . EM clustering is an iterative algorithm that maximizes . EM can be applied to many different types of probabilistic modeling. We will work with a mixture of multivariate Bernoulli distributions here, the distribution we know from Section 11.3 (page 11.3 ) and Section 13.3 (page 13.3 ):     (199)               The mixture model then is:     (200)       How do we use EM to infer the parameters of the clustering from the data? That is, how do we choose parameters that maximize ? EM is similar to -means in that it alternates between an expectation step , corresponding to reassignment, and a maximization step , corresponding to recomputation of the parameters of the model. The parameters of -means are the centroids, the parameters of the instance of EM in this section are the and . The maximization step recomputes the conditional parameters and the priors as follows:      (201)        13.3 13.3 The expectation step computes the soft assignment of documents to clusters given the current parameters and :      (202)   200   13.3   (a) docID document text docID document text   1 hot chocolate cocoa beans 7 sweet sugar   2 cocoa ghana africa 8 sugar cane brazil   3 beans harvest ghana 9 sweet sugar beet   4 cocoa butter 10 sweet cake icing   5 butter truffles 11 cake black forest   6 sweet chocolate     (b) Parameter Iteration of clustering     0 1 2 3 4 5 15 25     0.50 0.45 0.53 0.57 0.58 0.54 0.45     1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.79 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.84 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.75 0.94 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.52 0.66 0.91 1.00 1.00 1.00   1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.83 0.00   0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.50 0.40 0.14 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.50 0.57 0.58 0.41 0.07 0.00 0.00     0.000 0.100 0.134 0.158 0.158 0.169 0.200     0.000 0.083 0.042 0.001 0.000 0.000 0.000     0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000     0.000 0.167 0.195 0.213 0.214 0.196 0.167     0.000 0.400 0.432 0.465 0.474 0.508 0.600     0.000 0.167 0.090 0.014 0.001 0.000 0.000     0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000     1.000 0.500 0.585 0.640 0.642 0.589 0.500     1.000 0.300 0.238 0.180 0.159 0.153 0.000     1.000 0.417 0.507 0.610 0.640 0.608 0.667 The EM clustering algorithm.The table shows a set of documents (a) and parameter values for selected iterations during EM clustering (b). Parameters shown are prior , soft assignment scores (both omitted for cluster 2), and lexical parameters for a few terms. The authors initially assigned document 6 to cluster 1 and document 7 to cluster 2 (iteration 0). EM converges after 25 iterations. For smoothing, the in Equation  201 were replaced with where .  We clustered a set of 11 documents into two clusters using EM in Table 16.3 . After convergence in iteration 25, the first 5 documents are assigned to cluster 1 ( ) and the last 6 to cluster 2 (). Somewhat atypically, the final assignment is a hard assignment here. EM usually converges to a soft assignment. In iteration 25, the prior for cluster 1 is because 5 of the 11 documents are in cluster 1. Some terms are quickly associated with one cluster because the initial assignment can ``spread'' to them unambiguously. For example, membership in cluster 2 spreads from document 7 to document 8 in the first iteration because they share sugar ( in iteration 1). For parameters of terms occurring in ambiguous contexts, convergence takes longer. Seed documents 6 and 7 both contain sweet. As a result, it takes 25 iterations for the term to be unambiguously associated with cluster 2. ( in iteration 25.) Finding good seeds is even more critical for EM than for -means. EM is prone to get stuck in local optima if the seeds are not chosen well. This is a general problem that also occurs in other applications of EM.Therefore, as with -means, the initial assignment of documents to clusters is often computed by a different algorithm. For example, a hard -means clustering may provide the initial assignment, which EM can then ``soften up.'' Exercises. We saw above that the time complexity of -means is . What is the time complexity of EM?

   References and further reading Berkhin (2006b) gives a general up-to-date survey of clustering methods with special attention to scalability. The classic reference for clustering in pattern recognition, covering both -means and EM, is (Duda et al., 2000). Rasmussen (1992) introduces clustering from an information retrieval perspective. Anderberg (1973) provides a general introduction to clustering for applications. In addition to Euclidean distance and cosine similarity , Kullback-Leibler divergence is often used in clustering as a measure of how (dis)similar documents and clusters are (Xu and Croft, 1999, Muresan and Harper, 2004, Kurland and Lee, 2004). The cluster hypothesis is due to Jardine and van Rijsbergen (1971) who state it as follows: Associations between documents convey information about the relevance of documents to requests. Croft (1978), Can and Ozkarahan (1990), Voorhees (1985a), Salton (1975), Cacheda et al. (2003), Salton (1971a), Singitham et al. (2004), Can et al. (2004) and Altingövde et al. (2008) investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of cluster-based retrieval. While some of these studies show improvements in effectiveness, efficiency or both, there is no consensus that cluster-based retrieval works well consistently across scenarios. Cluster-based language modeling was pioneered by Liu and Croft (2004). There is good evidence that clustering of search results improves user experience and search result quality (Hearst and Pedersen, 1996, Zamir and Etzioni, 1999, Käki, 2005, Toda and Kataoka, 2005, Tombros et al., 2002), although not as much as search result structuring based on carefully edited category hierarchies (Hearst, 2006). The Scatter-Gather interface for browsing collections was presented by Cutting et al. (1992). A theoretical framework for analyzing the properties of Scatter/Gather and other information seeking user interfaces is presented by Pirolli (2007). Schütze and Silverstein (1997) evaluate LSI (Chapter 18 ) and truncated representations of centroids for efficient -means clustering. The Columbia NewsBlaster system (McKeown et al., 2002), a forerunner to the now much more famous and refined Google News (http://news.google.com), used hierarchical clustering (Chapter 17 ) to give two levels of news topic granularity. See Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2000) for details, and Chen and Lin (2000) and Radev et al. (2001) for related systems. Other applications of clustering in information retrieval are duplicate detection (Yang and Callan (2006), shingling), novelty detection (see references in hclstfurther) and metadata discovery on the semantic web (Alonso et al., 2006). The discussion of external evaluation measures is partially based on Strehl (2002). Dom (2002) proposes a measure that is better motivated theoretically than NMI. is the number of bits needed to transmit class memberships assuming cluster memberships are known. The Rand index is due to Rand (1971). Hubert and Arabie (1985) propose an adjusted that ranges between and 1 and is 0 if there is only chance agreement between clusters and classes (similar to in Chapter 8 , page 8.2 ). Basu et al. (2004) argue that the three evaluation measures NMI, Rand index and F measure give very similar results. Stein et al. (2003) propose expected edge density as an internal measure and give evidence that it is a good predictor of the quality of a clustering. Kleinberg (2002) and Meila (2005) present axiomatic frameworks for comparing clusterings. Authors that are often credited with the invention of the -means algorithm include Lloyd (1982) (first distributed in 1957), Ball (1965), MacQueen (1967), and Hartigan and Wong (1979). Arthur and Vassilvitskii (2006) investigate the worst-case complexity of -means. Bradley and Fayyad (1998), Pelleg and Moore (1999) and Davidson and Satyanarayana (2003) investigate the convergence properties of -means empirically and how it depends on initial seed selection. Dhillon and Modha (2001) compare -means clusters with SVD -based clusters (Chapter 18 ). The K-medoid algorithm was presented by Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). The EM algorithm was originally introduced by Dempster et al. (1977). An in-depth treatment of EM is (McLachlan and Krishnan, 1996). See Section 18.5 (page ) for publications on latent analysis, which can also be viewed as soft clustering. AIC is due to Akaike (1974) (see also Burnham and Anderson (2002)). An alternative to AIC is BIC, which can be motivated as a Bayesian model selection procedure (Schwarz, 1978). Fraley and Raftery (1998) show how to choose an optimal number of clusters based on BIC. An application of BIC to -means is (Pelleg and Moore, 2000). Hamerly and Elkan (2003) propose an alternative to BIC that performs better in their experiments. Another influential Bayesian approach for determining the number of clusters (simultaneously with cluster assignment) is described by Cheeseman and Stutz (1996). Two methods for determining cardinality without external criteria are presented by Tibshirani et al. (2001). We only have space here for classical completely unsupervised clustering. An important current topic of research is how to use prior knowledge to guide clustering (e.g., Ji and Xu (2006)) and how to incorporate interactive feedback during clustering (e.g., Huang and Mitchell (2006)). Fayyad et al. (1998) propose an initialization for EM clustering. For algorithms that can cluster very large data sets in one scan through the data see Bradley et al. (1998). The applications in Table 16.1 all cluster documents. Other information retrieval applications cluster words (e.g., Crouch, 1988), contexts of words (e.g., Schütze and Pedersen, 1995) or words and documents simultaneously (e.g., Tishby and Slonim, 2000, Zha et al., 2001, Dhillon, 2001). Simultaneous clustering of words and documents is an example of co-clustering or biclustering .

  <TITLE>Chapter 17 Hierarchical clustering</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Hierarchical clustering Flat clustering is efficient and conceptually simple, but as we saw in Chapter 16 it has a number of drawbacks. The algorithms introduced in Chapter 16 return a flat unstructured set of clusters, require a prespecified number of clusters as input and are nondeterministic. Hierarchical clustering (or hierarchic clustering ) outputs a hierarchy, a structure that is more informative than the unstructured set of clusters returned by flat clustering.Hierarchical clustering does not require us to prespecify the number of clusters and most hierarchical algorithms that have been used in IR are deterministic. These advantages of hierarchical clustering come at the cost of lower efficiency. The most common hierarchical clustering algorithms have a complexity that is at least quadratic in the number of documents compared to the linear complexity of -means and EM (cf. Section 16.4 , page 16.4 ). This chapter first introduces agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Section 17.1 ) and presents four different agglomerative algorithms, in Sections 17.2 -17.4 , which differ in the similarity measures they employ: single-link, complete-link, group-average, and centroid similarity. We then discuss the optimality conditions of hierarchical clustering in Section 17.5 . Section 17.6 introduces top-down (or divisive) hierarchical clustering. Section 17.7 looks at labeling clusters automatically, a problem that must be solved whenever humans interact with the output of clustering. We discuss implementation issues in Section 17.8 . Section 17.9 provides pointers to further reading, including references to soft hierarchical clustering, which we do not cover in this book. There are few differences between the applications of flat and hierarchical clustering in information retrieval. In particular, hierarchical clustering is appropriate for any of the applications shown in Table 16.1 (page 16.1 ; see also Section 16.6 , page 16.6 ). In fact, the example we gave for collection clustering is hierarchical. In general, we select flat clustering when efficiency is important and hierarchical clustering when one of the potential problems of flat clustering (not enough structure, predetermined number of clusters, non-determinism) is a concern. In addition, many researchers believe that hierarchical clustering produces better clusters than flat clustering. However, there is no consensus on this issue (see references in Section 17.9 ).

   Hierarchical agglomerative clustering  agglomerate  hierarchical agglomerative clustering  HAC 17.6  A dendrogram of a single-link clustering of 30 documents from Reuters-RCV1. Two possible cuts of the dendrogram are shown: at 0.4 into 24 clusters and at 0.1 into 12 clusters. Before looking at specific similarity measures used in HAC in Sections 17.2 -17.4 , we first introduce a method for depicting hierarchical clusterings graphically, discuss a few key properties of HACs and present a simple algorithm for computing an HAC. An HAC clustering is typically visualized as a dendrogram as shown in Figure 17.1 . Each merge is represented by a horizontal line. The y-coordinate of the horizontal line is the similarity of the two clusters that were merged, where documents are viewed as singleton clusters. We call this similarity the combination similarity of the merged cluster. For example, the combination similarity of the cluster consisting of Lloyd's CEO questioned and Lloyd's chief / U.S. grilling in Figure 17.1 is . We define the combination similarity of a singleton cluster as its document's self-similarity (which is 1.0 for cosine similarity). By moving up from the bottom layer to the top node, a dendrogram allows us to reconstruct the history of merges that resulted in the depicted clustering. For example, we see that the two documents entitled War hero Colin Powell were merged first in Figure 17.1 and that the last merge added Ag trade reform to a cluster consisting of the other 29 documents. A fundamental assumption in HAC is that the merge operation is monotonic . Monotonic means that if are the combination similarities of the successive merges of an HAC, then holds. A non-monotonic hierarchical clustering contains at least one inversion and contradicts the fundamental assumption that we chose the best merge available at each step. We will see an example of an inversion in Figure 17.12 . Hierarchical clustering does not require a prespecified number of clusters. However, in some applications we want a partition of disjoint clusters just as in flat clustering. In those cases, the hierarchy needs to be cut at some point. A number of criteria can be used to determine the cutting point: Cut at a prespecified level of similarity. For example, we cut the dendrogram at 0.4 if we want clusters with a minimum combination similarity of 0.4. In Figure 17.1 , cutting the diagram at yields 24 clusters (grouping only documents with high similarity together) and cutting it at yields 12 clusters (one large financial news cluster and 11 smaller clusters). Cut the dendrogram where the gap between two successive combination similarities is largest. Such large gaps arguably indicate ``natural'' clusterings. Adding one more cluster decreases the quality of the clustering significantly, so cutting before this steep decrease occurs is desirable. This strategy is analogous to looking for the knee in the -means graph in Figure 16.8 (page 16.8 ). Apply Equation 195 (page 16.4.1 ): where refers to the cut of the hierarchy that results in clusters, RSS is the residual sum of squares and is a penalty for each additional cluster. Instead of RSS, another measure of distortion can be used. As in flat clustering, we can also prespecify the number of clusters and select the cutting point that produces clusters.  Figure 17.2: A simple, but inefficient HAC algorithm.   A simple, naive HAC algorithm is shown in Figure 17.2 . We first compute the similarity matrix . The algorithm then executes steps of merging the currently most similar clusters. In each iteration, the two most similar clusters are merged and the rows and columns of the merged cluster in are updated.The clustering is stored as a list of merges in . indicates which clusters are still available to be merged. The function SIM computes the similarity of cluster with the merge of clusters and . For some HAC algorithms, SIM is simply a function of and , for example, the maximum of these two values for single-link. We will now refine this algorithm for the different similarity measures of single-link and complete-link clustering (Section 17.2 ) and group-average and centroid clustering ( and 17.4 ). The merge criteria of these four variants of HAC are shown in Figure 17.3 .

  <TITLE>17.2 Single-link and complete-link clustering</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Single-link and complete-link clustering In single-link clustering or single-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most similar members (see Figure 17.3 , (a)). This single-link merge criterion is local. We pay attention solely to the area where the two clusters come closest to each other. Other, more distant parts of the cluster and the clusters' overall structure are not taken into account. In complete-link clustering or complete-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most dissimilar members (see Figure 17.3 , (b)). This is equivalent to choosing the cluster pair whose merge has the smallest diameter. This complete-link merge criterion is non-local; the entire structure of the clustering can influence merge decisions. This results in a preference for compact clusters with small diameters over long, straggly clusters, but also causes sensitivity to outliers. A single document far from the center can increase diameters of candidate merge clusters dramatically and completely change the final clustering.  A dendrogram of a complete-link clustering.The same 30 documents were clustered with single-link clustering in Figure 17.1 . Figure 17.4 depicts a single-link and a complete-link clustering of eight documents. The first four steps, each producing a cluster consisting of a pair of two documents, are identical. Then single-link clustering joins the upper two pairs (and after that the lower two pairs) because on the maximum-similarity definition of cluster similarity, those two clusters are closest. Complete-link clustering joins the left two pairs (and then the right two pairs) because those are the closest pairs according to the minimum-similarity definition of cluster similarity. Figure 17.1 is an example of a single-link clustering of a set of documents and Figure 17.5 is the complete-link clustering of the same set. When cutting the last merge in Figure 17.5 , we obtain two clusters of similar size (documents 1-16, from NYSE closing averages to Lloyd's chief / U.S. grilling, and documents 17-30, from Ohio Blue Cross to Clinton signs law). There is no cut of the dendrogram in Figure 17.1 that would give us an equally balanced clustering. Both single-link and complete-link clustering have graph-theoretic interpretations. Define to be the combination similarity of the two clusters merged in step , and the graph that links all data points with a similarity of at least . Then the clusters after step in single-link clustering are the connected components of and the clusters after step in complete-link clustering are maximal cliques of . A connected component is a maximal set of connected points such that there is a path connecting each pair. A clique is a set of points that are completely linked with each other. These graph-theoretic interpretations motivate the terms single-link and complete-link clustering. Single-link clusters at step are maximal sets of points that are linked via at least one link (a single link) of similarity ; complete-link clusters at step are maximal sets of points that are completely linked with each other via links of similarity .   Single-link and complete-link clustering reduce the assessment of cluster quality to a single similarity between a pair of documents: the two most similar documents in single-link clustering and the two most dissimilar documents in complete-link clustering. A measurement based on one pair cannot fully reflect the distribution of documents in a cluster. It is therefore not surprising that both algorithms often produce undesirable clusters. Single-link clustering can produce straggling clusters as shown in Figure 17.6 . Since the merge criterion is strictly local, a chain of points can be extended for long distances without regard to the overall shape of the emerging cluster. This effect is called chaining . The chaining effect is also apparent in Figure 17.1 . The last eleven merges of the single-link clustering (those above the line) add on single documents or pairs of documents, corresponding to a chain. The complete-link clustering in Figure 17.5 avoids this problem. Documents are split into two groups of roughly equal size when we cut the dendrogram at the last merge. In general, this is a more useful organization of the data than a clustering with chains.   However, complete-link clustering suffers from a different problem. It pays too much attention to outliers, points that do not fit well into the global structure of the cluster. In the example in Figure 17.7 the four documents are split because of the outlier at the left edge (Exercise 17.2.1 ). Complete-link clustering does not find the most intuitive cluster structure in this example.   Subsections Time complexity of HAC

  <TITLE>17.2.1 Time complexity of HAC</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Time complexity of HAC The complexity of the naive HAC algorithm in Figure 17.2 is because we exhaustively scan the matrix for the largest similarity in each of iterations.   For the four HAC methods discussed in this chapter a more efficient algorithm is the priority-queue algorithm shown in Figure 17.8 . Its time complexity is . The rows of the similarity matrix are sorted in decreasing order of similarity in the priority queues . then returns the cluster in that currently has the highest similarity with , where we use to denote the cluster as in Chapter 16 . After creating the merged cluster of and , is used as its representative. The function SIM computes the similarity function for potential merge pairs: largest similarity for single-link, smallest similarity for complete-link, average similarity for GAAC (Section 17.3 ), and centroid similarity for centroid clustering (Section 17.4 ). We give an example of how a row of is processed (Figure 17.8 , bottom panel). The loop in lines 1-7 is and the loop in lines 9-21 is for an implementation of priority queues that supports deletion and insertion in . The overall complexity of the algorithm is therefore . In the definition of the function SIM, and are the vector sums of and , respectively, and and are the number of documents in and , respectively. The argument of EFFICIENTHAC in Figure 17.8 is a set of vectors (as opposed to a set of generic documents) because GAAC and centroid clustering ( and 17.4 ) require vectors as input. The complete-link version of EFFICIENTHAC can also be applied to documents that are not represented as vectors.   For single-link, we can introduce a next-best-merge array (NBM) as a further optimization as shown in Figure 17.9 . NBM keeps track of what the best merge is for each cluster. Each of the two top level for-loops in Figure 17.9 are , thus the overall complexity of single-link clustering is . Can we also speed up the other three HAC algorithms with an NBM array? We cannot because only single-link clustering is best-merge persistent . Suppose that the best merge cluster for is in single-link clustering. Then after merging with a third cluster , the merge of and will be 's best merge cluster (Exercise 17.10 ). In other words, the best-merge candidate for the merged cluster is one of the two best-merge candidates of its components in single-link clustering. This means that can be updated in in each iteration - by taking a simple max of two values on line 14 in Figure 17.9 for each of the remaining clusters.   Figure 17.10 demonstrates that best-merge persistence does not hold for complete-link clustering, which means that we cannot use an NBM array to speed up clustering. After merging 's best merge candidate with cluster , an unrelated cluster becomes the best merge candidate for . This is because the complete-link merge criterion is non-local and can be affected by points at a great distance from the area where two merge candidates meet. In practice, the efficiency penalty of the algorithm is small compared with the single-link algorithm since computing the similarity between two documents (e.g., as a dot product) is an order of magnitude slower than comparing two scalars in sorting. All four HAC algorithms in this chapter are with respect to similarity computations. So the difference in complexity is rarely a concern in practice when choosing one of the algorithms. Exercises. Show that complete-link clustering creates the two-cluster clustering depicted in Figure 17.7 .

   Group-average agglomerative clustering Group-average agglomerative clustering  GAAC 17.3 all  group-average clustering  average-link clustering SIM-GA  (203)         The motivation for GAAC is that our goal in selecting two clusters and as the next merge in HAC is that the resulting merge cluster should be coherent. To judge the coherence of , we need to look at all document-document similarities within , including those that occur within and those that occur within . We can compute the measure SIM-GA efficiently because the sum of individual vector similarities is equal to the similarities of their sums:     (204)    (205)         SIM FFICIENT 17.8 205 Equation 204 relies on the distributivity of the dot product with respect to vector addition. Since this is crucial for the efficient computation of a GAAC clustering, the method cannot be easily applied to representations of documents that are not real-valued vectors. Also, Equation 204 only holds for the dot product. While many algorithms introduced in this book have near-equivalent descriptions in terms of dot product, cosine similarity and Euclidean distance (cf. simdisfigs), Equation 204 can only be expressed using the dot product. This is a fundamental difference between single-link/complete-link clustering and GAAC. The first two only require a square matrix of similarities as input and do not care how these similarities were computed. To summarize, GAAC requires (i) documents represented as vectors, (ii) length normalization of vectors, so that self-similarities are 1.0, and (iii) the dot product as the measure of similarity between vectors and sums of vectors. The merge algorithms for GAAC and complete-link clustering are the same except that we use Equation 205 as similarity function in Figure 17.8 . Therefore, the overall time complexity of GAAC is the same as for complete-link clustering: . Like complete-link clustering, GAAC is not best-merge persistent (Exercise 17.10 ). This means that there is no algorithm for GAAC that would be analogous to the algorithm for single-link in Figure 17.9 . We can also define group-average similarity as including self-similarities:     (206)    139 139   Self-similarities are always equal to 1.0, the maximum possible value for length-normalized vectors. The proportion of self-similarities in Equation 206 is for a cluster of size . This gives an unfair advantage to small clusters since they will have proportionally more self-similarities. For two documents , with a similarity , we have . In contrast, . This similarity of two documents is the same as in single-link, complete-link and centroid clustering. We prefer the definition in Equation 205, which excludes self-similarities from the average, because we do not want to penalize large clusters for their smaller proportion of self-similarities and because we want a consistent similarity value for document pairs in all four HAC algorithms. Exercises. Apply group-average clustering to the points in and 17.7 . Map them onto the surface of the unit sphere in a three-dimensional space to get length-normalized vectors. Is the group-average clustering different from the single-link and complete-link clusterings?

   Centroid clustering   (207)   (208)   (209)   207 209 different 17.3 17.3 Figure 17.11 shows the first three steps of a centroid clustering. The first two iterations form the clusters with centroid and with centroid because the pairs and have the highest centroid similarities. In the third iteration, the highest centroid similarity is between and producing the cluster with centroid . Like GAAC, centroid clustering is not best-merge persistent and therefore (Exercise 17.10 ).   In contrast to the other three HAC algorithms, centroid clustering is not monotonic. So-called inversions can occur: Similarity can increase during clustering as in the example in Figure 17.12 , where we define similarity as negative distance. In the first merge, the similarity of and is . In the second merge, the similarity of the centroid of and (the circle) and is . This is an example of an inversion: similarity increases in this sequence of two clustering steps. In a monotonic HAC algorithm, similarity is monotonically decreasing from iteration to iteration. Increasing similarity in a series of HAC clustering steps contradicts the fundamental assumption that small clusters are more coherent than large clusters. An inversion in a dendrogram shows up as a horizontal merge line that is lower than the previous merge line. All merge lines in and 17.5 are higher than their predecessors because single-link and complete-link clustering are monotonic clustering algorithms. Despite its non-monotonicity, centroid clustering is often used because its similarity measure - the similarity of two centroids - is conceptually simpler than the average of all pairwise similarities in GAAC. Figure 17.11 is all one needs to understand centroid clustering. There is no equally simple graph that would explain how GAAC works. Exercises. For a fixed set of documents there are up to distinct similarities between clusters in single-link and complete-link clustering. How many distinct cluster similarities are there in GAAC and centroid clustering?

  <TITLE>17.5 Optimality of HAC</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Optimality of HAC To state the optimality conditions of hierarchical clustering precisely, we first define the combination similarity COMB-SIM of a clustering as the smallest combination similarity of any of its clusters: (210)       17.1 We then define to be optimal if all clusterings with clusters, , have lower combination similarities: (211)  Figure 17.12 shows that centroid clustering is not optimal. The clustering (for ) has combination similarity and (for ) has combination similarity -3.46. So the clustering produced in the first merge is not optimal since there is a clustering with fewer clusters ( ) that has higher combination similarity. Centroid clustering is not optimal because inversions can occur. The above definition of optimality would be of limited use if it was only applicable to a clustering together with its merge history. However, we can show (Exercise 17.5 ) that for the three non-inversion algorithms can be read off from the cluster without knowing its history. These direct definitions of combination similarity are as follows. single-link The combination similarity of a cluster is the smallest similarity of any bipartition of the cluster, where the similarity of a bipartition is the largest similarity between any two documents from the two parts: (212) where each is a bipartition of . complete-link The combination similarity of a cluster is the smallest similarity of any two points in : . GAAC The combination similarity of a cluster is the average of all pairwise similarities in (where self-similarities are not included in the average): Equation  205. We can now prove the optimality of single-link clustering by induction over the number of clusters . We will give a proof for the case where no two pairs of documents have the same similarity, but it can easily be extended to the case with ties. The inductive basis of the proof is that a clustering with clusters has combination similarity 1.0, which is the largest value possible. The induction hypothesis is that a single-link clustering with clusters is optimal: for all . Assume for contradiction that the clustering we obtain by merging the two most similar clusters in is not optimal and that instead a different sequence of merges leads to the optimal clustering with clusters. We can write the assumption that is optimal and that is not as . Case 1: The two documents linked by are in the same cluster in . They can only be in the same cluster if a merge with similarity smaller than has occurred in the merge sequence producing . This implies . Thus, . Contradiction. Case 2: The two documents linked by are not in the same cluster in . But , so the single-link merging rule should have merged these two clusters when processing . Contradiction. Thus, is optimal. In contrast to single-link clustering, complete-link clustering and GAAC are not optimal as this example shows:  Both algorithms merge the two points with distance 1 ( and ) first and thus cannot find the two-cluster clustering . But is optimal on the optimality criteria of complete-link clustering and GAAC. However, the merge criteria of complete-link clustering and GAAC approximate the desideratum of approximate sphericity better than the merge criterion of single-link clustering. In many applications, we want spherical clusters. Thus, even though single-link clustering may seem preferable at first because of its optimality, it is optimal with respect to the wrong criterion in many document clustering applications.   Table 17.1: Comparison of HAC algorithms. method combination similarity time compl. optimal? comment single-link max inter-similarity of any 2 docs yes chaining effect complete-link min inter-similarity of any 2 docs no sensitive to outliers group-average average of all sims no best choice for most applications centroid average inter-similarity no inversions can occur   Table 17.1 summarizes the properties of the four HAC algorithms introduced in this chapter. We recommend GAAC for document clustering because it is generally the method that produces the clustering with the best properties for applications. It does not suffer from chaining, from sensitivity to outliers and from inversions. There are two exceptions to this recommendation. First, for non-vector representations, GAAC is not applicable and clustering should typically be performed with the complete-link method. Second, in some applications the purpose of clustering is not to create a complete hierarchy or exhaustive partition of the entire document set. For instance, first story detection or novelty detection is the task of detecting the first occurrence of an event in a stream of news stories. One approach to this task is to find a tight cluster within the documents that were sent across the wire in a short period of time and are dissimilar from all previous documents. For example, the documents sent over the wire in the minutes after the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001 form such a cluster. Variations of single-link clustering can do well on this task since it is the structure of small parts of the vector space - and not global structure - that is important in this case. Similarly, we will describe an approach to duplicate detection on the web in Section 19.6 (page 19.6 ) where single-link clustering is used in the guise of the union-find algorithm . Again, the decision whether a group of documents are duplicates of each other is not influenced by documents that are located far away and single-link clustering is a good choice for duplicate detection. Exercises. Show the equivalence of the two definitions of combination similarity: the process definition on page 17.1 and the static definition on page 17.5 .

  <TITLE>17.6 Divisive clustering</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Divisive clustering  top-down clustering  divisive clustering Top-down clustering is conceptually more complex than bottom-up clustering since we need a second, flat clustering algorithm as a ``subroutine''. It has the advantage of being more efficient if we do not generate a complete hierarchy all the way down to individual document leaves. For a fixed number of top levels, using an efficient flat algorithm like -means, top-down algorithms are linear in the number of documents and clusters. So they run much faster than HAC algorithms, which are at least quadratic. There is evidence that divisive algorithms produce more accurate hierarchies than bottom-up algorithms in some circumstances. See the references on bisecting -means in Section 17.9 . Bottom-up methods make clustering decisions based on local patterns without initially taking into account the global distribution. These early decisions cannot be undone. Top-down clustering benefits from complete information about the global distribution when making top-level partitioning decisions.

  <TITLE>17.7 Cluster labeling</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Cluster labeling In many applications of flat clustering and hierarchical clustering, particularly in analysis tasks and in user interfaces (see applications in Table 16.1 , page 16.1 ), human users interact with clusters. In such settings, we must label clusters, so that users can see what a cluster is about. Differential cluster labeling selects cluster labels by comparing the distribution of terms in one cluster with that of other clusters. The feature selection methods we introduced in Section 13.5 (page ) can all be used for differential cluster labeling. In particular, mutual information (MI) (Section 13.5.1 , page 13.5.1 ) or, equivalently, information gain and the -test (Section 13.5.2 , page 13.5.2 ) will identify cluster labels that characterize one cluster in contrast to other clusters. A combination of a differential test with a penalty for rare terms often gives the best labeling results because rare terms are not necessarily representative of the cluster as a whole.       labeling method   # docs centroid mutual information title 4 622 oil plant mexico production crude power 000 refinery gas bpd plant oil production barrels crude bpd mexico dolly capacity petroleum MEXICO: Hurricane Dolly heads for Mexico coast 9 1017 police security russian people military peace killed told grozny court police killed military security peace told troops forces rebels people RUSSIA: Russia's Lebed meets rebel chief in Chechnya 10 1259 00 000 tonnes traders futures wheat prices cents september tonne delivery traders futures tonne tonnes desk wheat prices 000 00 USA: Export Business - Grain/oilseeds complex Automatically computed cluster labels.This is for three of ten clusters (4, 9, and 10) in a -means clustering of the first 10,000 documents in Reuters-RCV1. The last three columns show cluster summaries computed by three labeling methods: most highly weighted terms in centroid (centroid), mutual information, and the title of the document closest to the centroid of the cluster (title). Terms selected by only one of the first two methods are in bold.  We apply three labeling methods to a -means clustering in Table 17.2 . In this example, there is almost no difference between MI and . We therefore omit the latter. Cluster-internal labeling computes a label that solely depends on the cluster itself, not on other clusters. Labeling a cluster with the title of the document closest to the centroid is one cluster-internal method. Titles are easier to read than a list of terms. A full title can also contain important context that didn't make it into the top 10 terms selected by MI. On the web, anchor text can play a role similar to a title since the anchor text pointing to a page can serve as a concise summary of its contents. In Table 17.2 , the title for cluster 9 suggests that many of its documents are about the Chechnya conflict, a fact the MI terms do not reveal. However, a single document is unlikely to be representative of all documents in a cluster. An example is cluster 4, whose selected title is misleading. The main topic of the cluster is oil. Articles about hurricane Dolly only ended up in this cluster because of its effect on oil prices. We can also use a list of terms with high weights in the centroid of the cluster as a label. Such highly weighted terms (or, even better, phrases, especially noun phrases) are often more representative of the cluster than a few titles can be, even if they are not filtered for distinctiveness as in the differential methods. However, a list of phrases takes more time to digest for users than a well crafted title. Cluster-internal methods are efficient, but they fail to distinguish terms that are frequent in the collection as a whole from those that are frequent only in the cluster. Terms like year or Tuesday may be among the most frequent in a cluster, but they are not helpful in understanding the contents of a cluster with a specific topic like oil. In Table 17.2 , the centroid method selects a few more uninformative terms (000, court, cents, september) than MI (forces, desk), but most of the terms selected by either method are good descriptors. We get a good sense of the documents in a cluster from scanning the selected terms. For hierarchical clustering, additional complications arise in cluster labeling. Not only do we need to distinguish an internal node in the tree from its siblings, but also from its parent and its children. Documents in child nodes are by definition also members of their parent node, so we cannot use a naive differential method to find labels that distinguish the parent from its children. However, more complex criteria, based on a combination of overall collection frequency and prevalence in a given cluster, can determine whether a term is a more informative label for a child node or a parent node (see Section 17.9 ).

   Implementation notes In low dimensions, more aggressive optimizations are possible that make the computation of most pairwise similarities unnecessary (Exercise 17.10 ). However, no such algorithms are known in higher dimensions. We encountered the same problem in kNN classification (see Section 14.7 , page 14.7 ). When using GAAC on a large document set in high dimensions, we have to take care to avoid dense centroids. For dense centroids, clustering can take time where is the size of the vocabulary, whereas complete-link clustering is where is the average size of the vocabulary of a document. So for large vocabularies complete-link clustering can be more efficient than an unoptimized implementation of GAAC. We discussed this problem in the context of -means clustering in Chapter 16 (page 16.4 ) and suggested two solutions: truncating centroids (keeping only highly weighted terms) and representing clusters by means of sparse medoids instead of dense centroids. These optimizations can also be applied to GAAC and centroid clustering. Even with these optimizations, HAC algorithms are all or and therefore infeasible for large sets of 1,000,000 or more documents. For such large sets, HAC can only be used in combination with a flat clustering algorithm like -means. Recall that -means requires a set of seeds as initialization (Figure 16.5 , page 16.5 ). If these seeds are badly chosen, then the resulting clustering will be of poor quality. We can employ an HAC algorithm to compute seeds of high quality. If the HAC algorithm is applied to a document subset of size , then the overall runtime of -means cum HAC seed generation is . This is because the application of a quadratic algorithm to a sample of size has an overall complexity of . An appropriate adjustment can be made for an algorithm to guarantee linearity. This algorithm is referred to as the Buckshot algorithm . It combines the determinism and higher reliability of HAC with the efficiency of -means.

   References and further reading An excellent general review of clustering is (Jain et al., 1999). Early references for specific HAC algorithms are (King, 1967) (single-link), (Sneath and Sokal, 1973) (complete-link, GAAC) and (Lance and Williams, 1967) (discussing a large variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms). The single-link algorithm in Figure 17.9 is similar to Kruskal's algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree. A graph-theoretical proof of the correctness of Kruskal's algorithm (which is analogous to the proof in Section 17.5 ) is provided by Cormen et al. (1990, Theorem 23.1). See Exercise 17.10 for the connection between minimum spanning trees and single-link clusterings. It is often claimed that hierarchical clustering algorithms produce better clusterings than flat algorithms (Jain and Dubes (1988, p. 140), Cutting et al. (1992), Larsen and Aone (1999)) although more recently there have been experimental results suggesting the opposite (Zhao and Karypis, 2002). Even without a consensus on average behavior, there is no doubt that results of EM and -means are highly variable since they will often converge to a local optimum of poor quality. The HAC algorithms we have presented here are deterministic and thus more predictable. The complexity of complete-link, group-average and centroid clustering is sometimes given as (Day and Edelsbrunner, 1984, Murtagh, 1983, Voorhees, 1985b) because a document similarity computation is an order of magnitude more expensive than a simple comparison, the main operation executed in the merging steps after the similarity matrix has been computed. The centroid algorithm described here is due to Voorhees (1985b). Voorhees recommends complete-link and centroid clustering over single-link for a retrieval application. The Buckshot algorithm was originally published by Cutting et al. (1993). Allan et al. (1998) apply single-link clustering to first story detection . An important HAC technique not discussed here is Ward's method (El-Hamdouchi and Willett, 1986, Ward Jr., 1963), also called minimum variance clustering . In each step, it selects the merge with the smallest RSS (Chapter 16 , page 191 ). The merge criterion in Ward's method (a function of all individual distances from the centroid) is closely related to the merge criterion in GAAC (a function of all individual similarities to the centroid). Despite its importance for making the results of clustering useful, comparatively little work has been done on labeling clusters. Popescul and Ungar (2000) obtain good results with a combination of and collection frequency of a term. Glover et al. (2002b) use information gain for labeling clusters of web pages. Stein and zu Eissen's approach is ontology-based (2004). The more complex problem of labeling nodes in a hierarchy (which requires distinguishing more general labels for parents from more specific labels for children) is tackled by Glover et al. (2002a) and Treeratpituk and Callan (2006). Some clustering algorithms attempt to find a set of labels first and then build (often overlapping) clusters around the labels, thereby avoiding the problem of labeling altogether (Osinski and Weiss, 2005, Zamir and Etzioni, 1999, Käki, 2005). We know of no comprehensive study that compares the quality of such ``label-based'' clustering to the clustering algorithms discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 16 . In principle, work on multi-document summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995) is also applicable to cluster labeling, but multi-document summaries are usually longer than the short text fragments needed when labeling clusters (cf. snippets). Presenting clusters in a way that users can understand is a UI problem. We recommend reading (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, ch. 10) for an introduction to user interfaces in IR. An example of an efficient divisive algorithm is bisecting -means (Steinbach et al., 2000). Spectral clustering algorithms (Kannan et al., 2000, Dhillon, 2001, Zha et al., 2001, Ng et al., 2001a), including principal direction divisive partitioning (PDDP) (whose bisecting decisions are based on SVD , see Chapter 18 ) (Boley, 1998, Savaresi and Boley, 2004), are computationally more expensive than bisecting -means, but have the advantage of being deterministic. Unlike -means and EM, most hierarchical clustering algorithms do not have a probabilistic interpretation. Model-based hierarchical clustering (Kamvar et al., 2002, Vaithyanathan and Dom, 2000, Castro et al., 2004) is an exception. The evaluation methodology described in Section 16.3 (page 16.3 ) is also applicable to hierarchical clustering. Specialized evaluation measures for hierarchies are discussed by Fowlkes and Mallows (1983), Larsen and Aone (1999) and Sahoo et al. (2006). The R environment (R Development Core Team, 2005) offers good support for hierarchical clustering. The R function hclust implements single-link, complete-link, group-average, and centroid clustering; and Ward's method. Another option provided is median clustering which represents each cluster by its medoid (cf. k-medoids in Chapter 16 , page 16.4 ). Support for clustering vectors in high-dimensional spaces is provided by the software package CLUTO (http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/cluto).

  <TEXT>
   Matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing On page 6.3.1 we introduced the notion of a term-document matrix: an matrix , each of whose rows represents a term and each of whose columns represents a document in the collection. Even for a collection of modest size, the term-document matrix is likely to have several tens of thousands of rows and columns. In Section 18.1.1 we first develop a class of operations from linear algebra, known as matrix decomposition. In Section 18.2 we use a special form of matrix decomposition to construct a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix. In Section 18.3 we examine the application of such low-rank approximations to indexing and retrieving documents, a technique referred to as latent semantic indexing. While latent semantic indexing has not been established as a significant force in scoring and ranking for information retrieval, it remains an intriguing approach to clustering in a number of domains including for collections of text documents (Section 16.6 , page 16.6 ). Understanding its full potential remains an area of active research. Readers who do not require a refresher on linear algebra may skip Section 18.1 , although Example 18.1 is especially recommended as it highlights a property of eigenvalues that we exploit later in the chapter.

   Linear algebra review   The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in it; thus, . A square matrix all of whose off-diagonal entries are zero is called a diagonal matrix; its rank is equal to the number of non-zero diagonal entries. If all diagonal entries of such a diagonal matrix are , it is called the identity matrix of dimension and represented by . For a square matrix and a vector that is not all zeros, the values of satisfying (213)   eigenvalues    213  right eigenvector principal eigenvector. left eigenvectors     (214)    The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is obtained by rewriting Equation 213 in the form . The eigenvalues of are then the solutions of , where denotes the determinant of a square matrix . The equation is an th order polynomial equation in and can have at most roots, which are the eigenvalues of . These eigenvalues can in general be complex, even if all entries of are real. We now examine some further properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to set up the central idea of singular value decompositions in Section 18.2 below. First, we look at the relationship between matrix-vector multiplication and eigenvalues. Worked example. Consider the matrix (215)      (216)       (217)     (218)   (219)   (220)   (221)   End worked example. Example 18.1 shows that even though is an arbitrary vector, the effect of multiplication by is determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of . Furthermore, it is intuitively apparent from Equation 221 that the product is relatively unaffected by terms arising from the small eigenvalues of ; in our example, since , the contribution of the third term on the right hand side of Equation 221 is small. In fact, if we were to completely ignore the contribution in Equation 221 from the third eigenvector corresponding to , then the product would be computed to be rather than the correct product which is ; these two vectors are relatively close to each other by any of various metrics one could apply (such as the length of their vector difference). This suggests that the effect of small eigenvalues (and their eigenvectors) on a matrix-vector product is small. We will carry forward this intuition when studying matrix decompositions and low-rank approximations in Section 18.2 . Before doing so, we examine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of special forms of matrices that will be of particular interest to us. For a symmetric matrix , the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Further, if is both real and symmetric, the eigenvalues are all real. Worked example. Consider the real, symmetric matrix (222)        End worked example.   Subsections Matrix decompositions

The first of these, Theorem 18.1.1, gives the basic factorization of a square real-valued matrix into three factors.

   Term-document matrices and singular value decompositions      singular value decomposition 18.3  18.2  18.1.1          Theorem. Let be the rank of the matrix . Then, there is a singular-value decomposition ( SVD for short) of of the form (232)  The eigenvalues of are the same as the eigenvalues of ; For , let , with . Then the matrix is composed by setting for , and zero otherwise. End theorem. The values are referred to as the singular values of . It is instructive to examine the relationship of Theorem 18.2 to Theorem 18.1.1; we do this rather than derive the general proof of Theorem 18.2, which is beyond the scope of this book. By multiplying Equation 232 by its transposed version, we have (233)  Note now that in Equation 233, the left-hand side is a square symmetric matrix real-valued matrix, and the right-hand side represents its symmetric diagonal decomposition as in Theorem 18.1.1. What does the left-hand side represent? It is a square matrix with a row and a column corresponding to each of the terms. The entry in the matrix is a measure of the overlap between the th and th terms, based on their co-occurrence in documents. The precise mathematical meaning depends on the manner in which is constructed based on term weighting. Consider the case where is the term-document incidence matrix of page 1.1 , illustrated in Figure 1.1 . Then the entry in is the number of documents in which both term and term occur.   When writing down the numerical values of the SVD, it is conventional to represent as an matrix with the singular values on the diagonals, since all its entries outside this sub-matrix are zeros. Accordingly, it is conventional to omit the rightmost columns of corresponding to these omitted rows of ; likewise the rightmost columns of are omitted since they correspond in to the rows that will be multiplied by the columns of zeros in . This written form of the SVD is sometimes known as the reduced SVD or truncated SVD and we will encounter it again in Exercise 18.3 . Henceforth, our numerical examples and exercises will use this reduced form. Worked example. We now illustrate the singular-value decomposition of a matrix of rank 2; the singular values are and .  (234)  End worked example. As with the matrix decompositions defined in Section 18.1.1 , the singular value decomposition of a matrix can be computed by a variety of algorithms, many of which have been publicly available software implementations; pointers to these are given in Section 18.5 . Exercises. Let (235) be the term-document incidence matrix for a collection. Compute the co-occurrence matrix . What is the interpretation of the diagonal entries of when is a term-document incidence matrix? Verify that the SVD of the matrix in Equation 235 is (236) by verifying all of the properties in the statement of Theorem 18.2. Suppose that is a binary term-document incidence matrix. What do the entries of represent? Let (237) be a term-document matrix whose entries are term frequencies; thus term 1 occurs 2 times in document 2 and once in document 3. Compute ; observe that its entries are largest where two terms have their most frequent occurrences together in the same document.

  <TEXT>
   Low-rank approximations We next state a matrix approximation problem that at first seems to have little to do with information retrieval. We describe a solution to this matrix problem using singular-value decompositions, then develop its application to information retrieval. Given an matrix and a positive integer , we wish to find an matrix of rank at most , so as to minimize the Frobenius norm of the matrix difference , defined to be (238)               low-rank approximation The singular value decomposition can be used to solve the low-rank matrix approximation problem. We then derive from it an application to approximating term-document matrices. We invoke the following three-step procedure to this end: Given , construct its SVD in the form shown in (232); thus, . Derive from the matrix formed by replacing by zeros the smallest singular values on the diagonal of . Compute and output as the rank- approximation to .     18.1   Theorem. (239)  End theorem. Recalling that the singular values are in decreasing order , we learn from Theorem 18.3 that is the best rank- approximation to , incurring an error (measured by the Frobenius norm of ) equal to . Thus the larger is, the smaller this error (and in particular, for , the error is zero since ; provided , then and thus ).   To derive further insight into why the process of truncating the smallest singular values in helps generate a rank- approximation of low error, we examine the form of : (240)   (241)   (242)              Exercises. Compute a rank 1 approximation to the matrix in Example 235, using the SVD as in Exercise 236. What is the Frobenius norm of the error of this approximation? Consider now the computation in Exercise 18.3 . Following the schematic in Figure 18.2 , notice that for a rank 1 approximation we have being a scalar. Denote by the first column of and by the first column of . Show that the rank-1 approximation to can then be written as . reduced can be generalized to rank approximations: we let and denote the ``reduced'' matrices formed by retaining only the first columns of and , respectively. Thus is an matrix while is a matrix. Then, we have (243) where is the square submatrix of with the singular values on the diagonal. The primary advantage of using (243) is to eliminate a lot of redundant columns of zeros in and , thereby explicitly eliminating multiplication by columns that do not affect the low-rank approximation; this version of the SVD is sometimes known as the reduced SVD or truncated SVD and is a computationally simpler representation from which to compute the low rank approximation.

  <TITLE>18.4 Latent semantic indexing</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Latent semantic indexing    latent semantic indexing But first, we motivate such an approximation. Recall the vector space representation of documents and queries introduced in Section 6.3 (page ). This vector space representation enjoys a number of advantages including the uniform treatment of queries and documents as vectors, the induced score computation based on cosine similarity, the ability to weight different terms differently, and its extension beyond document retrieval to such applications as clustering and classification. The vector space representation suffers, however, from its inability to cope with two classic problems arising in natural languages: synonymy and polysemy. Synonymy refers to a case where two different words (say car and automobile) have the same meaning. Because the vector space representation fails to capture the relationship between synonymous terms such as car and automobile - according each a separate dimension in the vector space. Consequently the computed similarity between a query (say, car) and a document containing both car and automobile underestimates the true similarity that a user would perceive. Polysemy on the other hand refers to the case where a term such as charge has multiple meanings, so that the computed similarity overestimates the similarity that a user would perceive. Could we use the co-occurrences of terms (whether, for instance, charge occurs in a document containing steed versus in a document containing electron) to capture the latent semantic associations of terms and alleviate these problems? Even for a collection of modest size, the term-document matrix is likely to have several tens of thousand of rows and columns, and a rank in the tens of thousands as well. In latent semantic indexing (sometimes referred to as latent semantic analysis (LSA) ), we use the SVD to construct a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix, for a value of that is far smaller than the original rank of . In the experimental work cited later in this section, is generally chosen to be in the low hundreds. We thus map each row/column (respectively corresponding to a term/document) to a -dimensional space; this space is defined by the principal eigenvectors (corresponding to the largest eigenvalues) of and . Note that the matrix is itself still an matrix, irrespective of . Next, we use the new -dimensional LSI representation as we did the original representation - to compute similarities between vectors. A query vector is mapped into its representation in the LSI space by the transformation (244)  6.3.1  244  244 The fidelity of the approximation of to leads us to hope that the relative values of cosine similarities are preserved: if a query is close to a document in the original space, it remains relatively close in the -dimensional space. But this in itself is not sufficiently interesting, especially given that the sparse query vector turns into a dense query vector in the low-dimensional space. This has a significant computational cost, when compared with the cost of processing in its native form. Worked example. Consider the term-document matrix         ship 1 0 1 0 0 0     boat 0 1 0 0 0 0     ocean 1 1 0 0 0 0     voyage 1 0 0 1 1 0     trip 0 0 0 1 0 1   Its singular value decomposition is the product of three matrices as below. First we have which in this example is:     1 2 3 4 5     ship     boat 0.00 0.73     ocean 0.00     voyage 0.35 0.15 0.16     trip 0.65 0.58   When applying the SVD to a term-document matrix, is known as the SVD term matrix. The singular values are 2.16 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.59 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.28 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.39 Finally we have , which in the context of a term-document matrix is known as the SVD document matrix:         1     2 0.63 0.22 0.41     3 0.28 0.45 0.12     4 0.00 0.00 0.58 0.00 0.58     5 0.29 0.63 0.19 0.41   By ``zeroing out'' all but the two largest singular values of , we obtain 2.16 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.59 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 From this, we compute         1     2 1.00 0.35 0.65     3 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     4 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     5 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00   Notice that the low-rank approximation, unlike the original matrix , can have negative entries. End worked example. Examination of and in Example 18.4 shows that the last 3 rows of each of these matrices are populated entirely by zeros. This suggests that the SVD product in Equation 241 can be carried out with only two rows in the representations of and ; we may then replace these matrices by their truncated versions and . For instance, the truncated SVD document matrix in this example is:         1     2 1.00 0.35 0.65   Figure 18.3 illustrates the documents in in two dimensions. Note also that is dense relative to .  Figure 18.3: The documents of Example  18.4 reduced to two dimensions in . We may in general view the low-rank approximation of by as a constrained optimization problem: subject to the constraint that have rank at most , we seek a representation of the terms and documents comprising with low Frobenius norm for the error . When forced to squeeze the terms/documents down to a -dimensional space, the SVD should bring together terms with similar co-occurrences. This intuition suggests, then, that not only should retrieval quality not suffer too much from the dimension reduction, but in fact may improve. Dumais (1993) and Dumais (1995) conducted experiments with LSI on TREC documents and tasks, using the commonly-used Lanczos algorithm to compute the SVD. At the time of their work in the early 1990's, the LSI computation on tens of thousands of documents took approximately a day on one machine. On these experiments, they achieved precision at or above that of the median TREC participant. On about 20% of TREC topics their system was the top scorer, and reportedly slightly better on average than standard vector spaces for LSI at about 350 dimensions. Here are some conclusions on LSI first suggested by their work, and subsequently verified by many other experiments.  The computational cost of the SVD is significant; at the time of this writing, we know of no successful experiment with over one million documents. This has been the biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption to LSI. One approach to this obstacle is to build the LSI representation on a randomly sampled subset of the documents in the collection, following which the remaining documents are ``folded in'' as detailed with Equation 244. As we reduce , recall tends to increase, as expected. Most surprisingly, a value of in the low hundreds can actually increase precision on some query benchmarks. This appears to suggest that for a suitable value of , LSI addresses some of the challenges of synonymy. LSI works best in applications where there is little overlap between queries and documents. The experiments also documented some modes where LSI failed to match the effectiveness of more traditional indexes and score computations. Most notably (and perhaps obviously), LSI shares two basic drawbacks of vector space retrieval: there is no good way of expressing negations (find documents that contain german but not shepherd), and no way of enforcing Boolean conditions. LSI can be viewed as soft clustering by interpreting each dimension of the reduced space as a cluster and the value that a document has on that dimension as its fractional membership in that cluster.

Theorem 18.3 is due to Eckart and Young (1936). The connection between information retrieval and low-rank approximations of the term-document matrix was introduced in Deerwester et al. (1990), with a subsequent survey of results in Berry et al. (1995). Dumais (1993) and Dumais (1995) describe experiments on TREC benchmarks giving evidence that at least on some benchmarks, LSI can produce better precision and recall than standard vector-space retrieval. http://www.cs.utk.edu/~berry/lsi++/and http://lsi.argreenhouse.com/lsi/LSIpapers.htmloffer comprehensive pointers to the literature and software of LSI. Schütze and Silverstein (1997) evaluate LSI and truncated representations of centroids for efficient -means clustering (Section 16.4 ).

Applications of LSI to cross-language information retrieval (where documents in two or more different languages are indexed, and a query posed in one language is expected to retrieve documents in other languages) are developed in Berry and Young (1995) and Littman et al. (1998). LSI (referred to as LSA in more general settings) has been applied to host of other problems in computer science ranging from memory modeling to computer vision. Hofmann (1999a;b) provides an initial probabilistic extension of the basic latent semantic indexing technique. A more satisfactory formal basis for a probabilistic latent variable model for dimensionality reduction is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) model (Blei et al., 2003), which is generative and assigns probabilities to documents outside of the training set. This model is extended to a hierarchical clustering by Rosen-Zvi et al. (2004). Wei and Croft (2006) present the first large scale evaluation of LDA, finding it to significantly outperform the query likelihood model of Section 12.2 (page ), but to not perform quite as well as the relevance model mentioned in Section 12.4 (page ) - but the latter does additional per-query processing unlike LDA. Teh et al. (2006) generalize further by presenting Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes , a probabilistic model which allows a group (for us, a document) to be drawn from an infinite mixture of latent topics, while still allowing these topics to be shared across documents.

  <TITLE>19.1 Background and history</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Background and history The invention of hypertext, envisioned by Vannevar Bush in the 1940's and first realized in working systems in the 1970's, significantly precedes the formation of the World Wide Web (which we will simply refer to as the Web), in the 1990's. Web usage has shown tremendous growth to the point where it now claims a good fraction of humanity as participants, by relying on a simple, open client-server design: (1) the server communicates with the client via a protocol (the http or hypertext transfer protocol) that is lightweight and simple, asynchronously carrying a variety of payloads (text, images and - over time - richer media such as audio and video files) encoded in a simple markup language called HTML (for hypertext markup language); (2) the client - generally a browser, an application within a graphical user environment - can ignore what it does not understand. Each of these seemingly innocuous features has contributed enormously to the growth of the Web, so it is worthwhile to examine them further. The basic operation is as follows: a client (such as a browser) sends an http request to a web server. The browser specifies a URL (for Uniform Resource Locator) such as http://www.stanford.edu/home/atoz/contact.html. In this example URL, the string http refers to the protocol to be used for transmitting the data. The string www.stanford.edu is known as the domain and specifies the root of a hierarchy of web pages (typically mirroring a filesystem hierarchy underlying the web server). In this example, /home/atoz/contact.html is a path in this hierarchy with a file contact.html that contains the information to be returned by the web server at www.stanford.edu in response to this request. The HTML-encoded file contact.html holds the hyperlinks and the content (in this instance, contact information for Stanford University), as well as formatting rules for rendering this content in a browser. Such an http request thus allows us to fetch the content of a page, something that will prove to be useful to us for crawling and indexing documents (Chapter 20 ). The designers of the first browsers made it easy to view the HTML markup tags on the content of a URL. This simple convenience allowed new users to create their own HTML content without extensive training or experience; rather, they learned from example content that they liked. As they did so, a second feature of browsers supported the rapid proliferation of web content creation and usage: browsers ignored what they did not understand. This did not, as one might fear, lead to the creation of numerous incompatible dialects of HTML. What it did promote was amateur content creators who could freely experiment with and learn from their newly created web pages without fear that a simple syntax error would ``bring the system down.'' Publishing on the Web became a mass activity that was not limited to a few trained programmers, but rather open to tens and eventually hundreds of millions of individuals. For most users and for most information needs, the Web quickly became the best way to supply and consume information on everything from rare ailments to subway schedules. The mass publishing of information on the Web is essentially useless unless this wealth of information can be discovered and consumed by other users. Early attempts at making web information ``discoverable'' fell into two broad categories: (1) full-text index search engines such as Altavista, Excite and Infoseek and (2) taxonomies populated with web pages in categories, such as Yahoo! The former presented the user with a keyword search interface supported by inverted indexes and ranking mechanisms building on those introduced in earlier chapters. The latter allowed the user to browse through a hierarchical tree of category labels. While this is at first blush a convenient and intuitive metaphor for finding web pages, it has a number of drawbacks: first, accurately classifying web pages into taxonomy tree nodes is for the most part a manual editorial process, which is difficult to scale with the size of the Web. Arguably, we only need to have ``high-quality'' web pages in the taxonomy, with only the best web pages for each category. However, just discovering these and classifying them accurately and consistently into the taxonomy entails significant human effort. Furthermore, in order for a user to effectively discover web pages classified into the nodes of the taxonomy tree, the user's idea of what sub-tree(s) to seek for a particular topic should match that of the editors performing the classification. This quickly becomes challenging as the size of the taxonomy grows; the Yahoo! taxonomy tree surpassed 1000 distinct nodes fairly early on. Given these challenges, the popularity of taxonomies declined over time, even though variants (such as About.com and the Open Directory Project) sprang up with subject-matter experts collecting and annotating web pages for each category. The first generation of web search engines transported classical search techniques such as those in the preceding chapters to the web domain, focusing on the challenge of scale. The earliest web search engines had to contend with indexes containing tens of millions of documents, which was a few orders of magnitude larger than any prior information retrieval system in the public domain. Indexing, query serving and ranking at this scale required the harnessing together of tens of machines to create highly available systems, again at scales not witnessed hitherto in a consumer-facing search application. The first generation of web search engines was largely successful at solving these challenges while continually indexing a significant fraction of the Web, all the while serving queries with sub-second response times. However, the quality and relevance of web search results left much to be desired owing to the idiosyncrasies of content creation on the Web that we discuss in Section 19.2 . This necessitated the invention of new ranking and spam-fighting techniques in order to ensure the quality of the search results. While classical information retrieval techniques (such as those covered earlier in this book) continue to be necessary for web search, they are not by any means sufficient. A key aspect (developed further in Chapter 21 ) is that whereas classical techniques measure the relevance of a document to a query, there remains a need to gauge the authoritativeness of a document based on cues such as which website hosts it.

  <TITLE>19.2 Web characteristics</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Web characteristics What about the substance of the text in web pages? The democratization of content creation on the web meant a new level of granularity in opinion on virtually any subject. This meant that the web contained truth, lies, contradictions and suppositions on a grand scale. This gives rise to the question: which web pages does one trust? In a simplistic approach, one might argue that some publishers are trustworthy and others not - begging the question of how a search engine is to assign such a measure of trust to each website or web page. In Chapter 21 we will examine approaches to understanding this question. More subtly, there may be no universal, user-independent notion of trust; a web page whose contents are trustworthy to one user may not be so to another. In traditional (non-web) publishing this is not an issue: users self-select sources they find trustworthy. Thus one reader may find the reporting of The New York Times to be reliable, while another may prefer The Wall Street Journal. But when a search engine is the only viable means for a user to become aware of (let alone select) most content, this challenge becomes significant. While the question ``how big is the Web?'' has no easy answer (see Section 19.5 ), the question ``how many web pages are in a search engine's index'' is more precise, although, even this question has issues. By the end of 1995, Altavista reported that it had crawled and indexed approximately 30 million static web pages . Static web pages are those whose content does not vary from one request for that page to the next. For this purpose, a professor who manually updates his home page every week is considered to have a static web page, but an airport's flight status page is considered to be dynamic. Dynamic pages are typically mechanically generated by an application server in response to a query to a database, as show in Figure 19.1 . One sign of such a page is that the URL has the character "?" in it. Since the number of static web pages was believed to be doubling every few months in 1995, early web search engines such as Altavista had to constantly add hardware and bandwidth for crawling and indexing web pages. A dynamically generated web page.The browser sends a request for flight information on flight AA129 to the web application, that fetches the information from back-end databases then creates a dynamic web page that it returns to the browser.

  <TITLE>19.2.1 The web graph</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The web graph  Figure 19.2: Two nodes of the web graph joined by a link. Figure 19.2 shows two nodes A and B from the web graph, each corresponding to a web page, with a hyperlink from A to B. We refer to the set of all such nodes and directed edges as the web graph. Figure 19.2 also shows that (as is the case with most links on web pages) there is some text surrounding the origin of the hyperlink on page A. This text is generally encapsulated in the href attribute of the  (for anchor) tag that encodes the hyperlink in the HTML code of page A, and is referred to as anchor text . As one might suspect, this directed graph is not strongly connected: there are pairs of pages such that one cannot proceed from one page of the pair to the other by following hyperlinks. We refer to the hyperlinks into a page as in-links and those out of a page as out-links . The number of in-links to a page (also known as its in-degree) has averaged from roughly 8 to 15, in a range of studies. We similarly define the out-degree of a web page to be the number of links out of it. These notions are represented in Figure 19.3 .  A sample small web graph.In this example we have six pages labeled A-F. Page B has in-degree 3 and out-degree 1. This example graph is not strongly connected: there is no path from any of pages B-F to page A. There is ample evidence that these links are not randomly distributed; for one thing, the distribution of the number of links into a web page does not follow the Poisson distribution one would expect if every web page were to pick the destinations of its links uniformly at random. Rather, this distribution is widely reported to be a power law , in which the total number of web pages with in-degree is proportional to ; the value of typically reported by studies is 2.1. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that the directed graph connecting web pages has a bowtie shape: there are three major categories of web pages that are sometimes referred to as IN, OUT and SCC. A web surfer can pass from any page in IN to any page in SCC, by following hyperlinks. Likewise, a surfer can pass from page in SCC to any page in OUT. Finally, the surfer can surf from any page in SCC to any other page in SCC. However, it is not possible to pass from a page in SCC to any page in IN, or from a page in OUT to a page in SCC (or, consequently, IN). Notably, in several studies IN and OUT are roughly equal in size, whereas SCC is somewhat larger; most web pages fall into one of these three sets. The remaining pages form into tubes that are small sets of pages outside SCC that lead directly from IN to OUT, and tendrils that either lead nowhere from IN, or from nowhere to OUT. Figure 19.4 illustrates this structure of the Web. The bowtie structure of the Web.Here we show one tube and three tendrils.

  <TITLE>19.2.2 Spam</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Spam  spam spammers At its root, spam stems from the heterogeneity of motives in content creation on the Web. In particular, many web content creators have commercial motives and therefore stand to gain from manipulating search engine results. You might argue that this is no different from a company that uses large fonts to list its phone numbers in the yellow pages; but this generally costs the company more and is thus a fairer mechanism. A more apt analogy, perhaps, is the use of company names beginning with a long string of A's to be listed early in a yellow pages category. In fact, the yellow pages' model of companies paying for larger/darker fonts has been replicated in web search: in many search engines, it is possible to pay to have one's web page included in the search engine's index - a model known as paid inclusion . Different search engines have different policies on whether to allow paid inclusion, and whether such a payment has any effect on ranking in search results. Search engines soon became sophisticated enough in their spam detection to screen out a large number of repetitions of particular keywords. Spammers responded with a richer set of spam techniques, the best known of which we now describe. The first of these techniques is cloaking, shown in Figure 19.5 . Here, the spammer's web server returns different pages depending on whether the http request comes from a web search engine's crawler (the part of the search engine that gathers web pages, to be described in Chapter 20 ), or from a human user's browser. The former causes the web page to be indexed by the search engine under misleading keywords. When the user searches for these keywords and elects to view the page, he receives a web page that has altogether different content than that indexed by the search engine. Such deception of search indexers is unknown in the traditional world of information retrieval; it stems from the fact that the relationship between page publishers and web search engines is not completely collaborative.  Figure 19.5: Cloaking as used by spammers. A doorway page contains text and metadata carefully chosen to rank highly on selected search keywords. When a browser requests the doorway page, it is redirected to a page containing content of a more commercial nature. More complex spamming techniques involve manipulation of the metadata related to a page including (for reasons we will see in Chapter 21 ) the links into a web page. Given that spamming is inherently an economically motivated activity, there has sprung around it an industry of Search Engine Optimizers , or SEOs to provide consultancy services for clients who seek to have their web pages rank highly on selected keywords. Web search engines frown on this business of attempting to decipher and adapt to their proprietary ranking techniques and indeed announce policies on forms of SEO behavior they do not tolerate (and have been known to shut down search requests from certain SEOs for violation of these). Inevitably, the parrying between such SEOs (who gradually infer features of each web search engine's ranking methods) and the web search engines (who adapt in response) is an unending struggle; indeed, the research sub-area of adversarial information retrieval has sprung up around this battle. To combat spammers who manipulate the text of their web pages is the exploitation of the link structure of the Web - a technique known as link analysis. The first web search engine known to apply link analysis on a large scale (to be detailed in Chapter 21 ) was Google, although all web search engines currently make use of it (and correspondingly, spammers now invest considerable effort in subverting it - this is known as link spam ). Exercises. If the number of pages with in-degree is proportional to , what is the probability that a randomly chosen web page has in-degree ? If the number of pages with in-degree is proportional to , what is the average in-degree of a web page? If the number of pages with in-degree is proportional to , then as the largest in-degree goes to infinity, does the fraction of pages with in-degree grow, stay the same, or diminish? How would your answer change for values of the exponent other than ? The average in-degree of all nodes in a snapshot of the web graph is 9. What can we say about the average out-degree of all nodes in this snapshot?

  <TITLE>19.3 Advertising as the economic model</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Advertising as the economic model branding cost per mil  CPM impressions clicked on cost per click  CPC The pioneer in this direction was a company named Goto, which changed its name to Overture prior to eventual acquisition by Yahoo! Goto was not, in the traditional sense, a search engine; rather, for every query term it accepted bids from companies who wanted their web page shown on the query . In response to the query , Goto would return the pages of all advertisers who bid for , ordered by their bids. Furthermore, when the user clicked on one of the returned results, the corresponding advertiser would make a payment to Goto (in the initial implementation, this payment equaled the advertiser's bid for ). Several aspects of Goto's model are worth highlighting. First, a user typing the query into Goto's search interface was actively expressing an interest and intent related to the query . For instance, a user typing golf clubs is more likely to be imminently purchasing a set than one who is simply browsing news on golf. Second, Goto only got compensated when a user actually expressed interest in an advertisement - as evinced by the user clicking the advertisement. Taken together, these created a powerful mechanism by which to connect advertisers to consumers, quickly raising the annual revenues of Goto/Overture into hundreds of millions of dollars. This style of search engine came to be known variously as sponsored search or search advertising . Given these two kinds of search engines - the ``pure'' search engines such as Google and Altavista, versus the sponsored search engines - the logical next step was to combine them into a single user experience. Current search engines follow precisely this model: they provide pure search results (generally known as algorithmic search results) as the primary response to a user's search, together with sponsored search results displayed separately and distinctively to the right of the algorithmic results. This is shown in Figure 19.6 . Retrieving sponsored search results and ranking them in response to a query has now become considerably more sophisticated than the simple Goto scheme; the process entails a blending of ideas from information retrieval and microeconomics, and is beyond the scope of this book. For advertisers, understanding how search engines do this ranking and how to allocate marketing campaign budgets to different keywords and to different sponsored search engines has become a profession known as search engine marketing (SEM).  Search advertising triggered by query keywords.Here the query A320 returns algorithmic search results about the Airbus aircraft, together with advertisements for various non-aircraft goods numbered A320, that advertisers seek to market to those querying on this query. The lack of advertisements for the aircraft reflects the fact that few marketers attempt to sell A320 aircraft on the web. The inherently economic motives underlying sponsored search give rise to attempts by some participants to subvert the system to their advantage. This can take many forms, one of which is known as click spam . There is currently no universally accepted definition of click spam. It refers (as the name suggests) to clicks on sponsored search results that are not from bona fide search users. For instance, a devious advertiser may attempt to exhaust the advertising budget of a competitor by clicking repeatedly (through the use of a robotic click generator) on that competitor's sponsored search advertisements. Search engines face the challenge of discerning which of the clicks they observe are part of a pattern of click spam, to avoid charging their advertiser clients for such clicks. Exercises. The Goto method ranked advertisements matching a query by bid: the highest-bidding advertiser got the top position, the second-highest the next, and so on. What can go wrong with this when the highest-bidding advertiser places an advertisement that is irrelevant to the query? Why might an advertiser with an irrelevant advertisement bid high in this manner? Suppose that, in addition to bids, we had for each advertiser their click-through rate: the ratio of the historical number of times users click on their advertisement to the number of times the advertisement was shown. Suggest a modification of the Goto scheme that exploits this data to avoid the problem in Exercise 19.3 above.

  <TITLE>19.4 The search user experience</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The search user experience It is clear that the more user traffic a web search engine can attract, the more revenue it stands to earn from sponsored search. How do search engines differentiate themselves and grow their traffic? Here Google identified two principles that helped it grow at the expense of its competitors: (1) a focus on relevance, specifically precision rather than recall in the first few results; (2) a user experience that is lightweight, meaning that both the search query page and the search results page are uncluttered and almost entirely textual, with very few graphical elements. The effect of the first was simply to save users time in locating the information they sought. The effect of the second is to provide a user experience that is extremely responsive, or at any rate not bottlenecked by the time to load the search query or results page.

  <TITLE>19.4.1 User query needs</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   User query needs Informational queries seek general information on a broad topic, such as leukemia or Provence. There is typically not a single web page that contains all the information sought; indeed, users with informational queries typically try to assimilate information from multiple web pages. Navigational queries seek the website or home page of a single entity that the user has in mind, say Lufthansa airlines. In such cases, the user's expectation is that the very first search result should be the home page of Lufthansa. The user is not interested in a plethora of documents containing the term Lufthansa; for such a user, the best measure of user satisfaction is precision at 1. A transactional query is one that is a prelude to the user performing a transaction on the Web - such as purchasing a product, downloading a file or making a reservation. In such cases, the search engine should return results listing services that provide form interfaces for such transactions. Discerning which of these categories a query falls into can be challenging. The category not only governs the algorithmic search results, but the suitability of the query for sponsored search results (since the query may reveal an intent to purchase). For navigational queries, some have argued that the search engine should return only a single result or even the target web page directly. Nevertheless, web search engines have historically engaged in a battle of bragging rights over which one indexes more web pages. Does the user really care? Perhaps not, but the media does highlight estimates (often statistically indefensible) of the sizes of various search engines. Users are influenced by these reports and thus, search engines do have to pay attention to how their index sizes compare to competitors'. For informational (and to a lesser extent, transactional) queries, the user does care about the comprehensiveness of the search engine. Figure 19.7 shows a composite picture of a web search engine including the crawler, as well as both the web page and advertisement indexes. The portion of the figure under the curved dashed line is internal to the search engine.  Figure 19.7: The various components of a web search engine.

  <TITLE>19.5 Index size and estimation</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Index size and estimation http://www.yahoo.com/any_string  spider traps 20 We could ask the following better-defined question: given two search engines, what are the relative sizes of their indexes? Even this question turns out to be imprecise, because: In response to queries a search engine can return web pages whose contents it has not (fully or even partially) indexed. For one thing, search engines generally index only the first few thousand words in a web page. In some cases, a search engine is aware of a page that is linked to by pages it has indexed, but has not indexed itself. As we will see in Chapter 21 , it is still possible to meaningfully return in search results. Search engines generally organize their indexes in various tiers and partitions, not all of which are examined on every search (recall tiered indexes from Section 7.2.1 ). For instance, a web page deep inside a website may be indexed but not retrieved on general web searches; it is however retrieved as a result on a search that a user has explicitly restricted to that website (such site-specific search is offered by most web search engines).   20  capture-recapture method Suppose that we could pick a random page from the index of and test whether it is in 's index and symmetrically, test whether a random page from is in . These experiments give us fractions and such that our estimate is that a fraction of the pages in are in , while a fraction of the pages in are in . Then, letting denote the size of the index of search engine , we have (245)   (246)    246   from outside the search engine To implement the sampling phase, we might generate a random page from the entire (idealized, finite) Web and test it for presence in each search engine. Unfortunately, picking a web page uniformly at random is a difficult problem. We briefly outline several attempts to achieve such a sample, pointing out the biases inherent to each; following this we describe in some detail one technique that much research has built on. Random searches: Begin with a search log of web searches; send a random search from this log to and a random page from the results. Since such logs are not widely available outside a search engine, one implementation is to trap all search queries going out of a work group (say scientists in a research center) that agrees to have all its searches logged. This approach has a number of issues, including the bias from the types of searches made by the work group. Further, a random document from the results of such a random search to is not the same as a random document from . Random IP addresses: A second approach is to generate random IP addresses and send a request to a web server residing at the random address, collecting all pages at that server. The biases here include the fact that many hosts might share one IP (due to a practice known as virtual hosting) or not accept http requests from the host where the experiment is conducted. Furthermore, this technique is more likely to hit one of the many sites with few pages, skewing the document probabilities; we may be able to correct for this effect if we understand the distribution of the number of pages on websites. Random walks: If the web graph were a strongly connected directed graph, we could run a random walk starting at an arbitrary web page. This walk would converge to a steady state distribution (see Chapter 21 , Section 21.2.1 for more background material on this), from which we could in principle pick a web page with a fixed probability. This method, too has a number of biases. First, the Web is not strongly connected so that, even with various corrective rules, it is difficult to argue that we can reach a steady state distribution starting from any page. Second, the time it takes for the random walk to settle into this steady state is unknown and could exceed the length of the experiment. Clearly each of these approaches is far from perfect. We now describe a fourth sampling approach, random queries. This approach is noteworthy for two reasons: it has been successfully built upon for a series of increasingly refined estimates, and conversely it has turned out to be the approach most likely to be misinterpreted and carelessly implemented, leading to misleading measurements. The idea is to pick a page (almost) uniformly at random from a search engine's index by posing a random query to it. It should be clear that picking a set of random terms from (say) Webster's dictionary is not a good way of implementing this idea. For one thing, not all vocabulary terms occur equally often, so this approach will not result in documents being chosen uniformly at random from the search engine. For another, there are a great many terms in web documents that do not occur in a standard dictionary such as Webster's. To address the problem of vocabulary terms not in a standard dictionary, we begin by amassing a sample web dictionary. This could be done by crawling a limited portion of the Web, or by crawling a manually-assembled representative subset of the Web such as Yahoo! (as was done in the earliest experiments with this method). Consider a conjunctive query with two or more randomly chosen words from this dictionary. Operationally, we proceed as follows: we use a random conjunctive query on and pick from the top 100 returned results a page at random. We then test for presence in by choosing 6-8 low-frequency terms in and using them in a conjunctive query for . We can improve the estimate by repeating the experiment a large number of times. Both the sampling process and the testing process have a number of issues. Our sample is biased towards longer documents. Picking from the top 100 results of induces a bias from the ranking algorithm of . Picking from all the results of makes the experiment slower. This is particularly so because most web search engines put up defenses against excessive robotic querying. During the checking phase, a number of additional biases are introduced: for instance, may not handle 8-word conjunctive queries properly. Either or may refuse to respond to the test queries, treating them as robotic spam rather than as bona fide queries. There could be operational problems like connection time-outs. A sequence of research has built on this basic paradigm to eliminate some of these issues; there is no perfect solution yet, but the level of sophistication in statistics for understanding the biases is increasing. The main idea is to address biases by estimating, for each document, the magnitude of the bias. From this, standard statistical sampling methods can generate unbiased samples. In the checking phase, the newer work moves away from conjunctive queries to phrase and other queries that appear to be better-behaved. Finally, newer experiments use other sampling methods besides random queries. The best known of these is document random walk sampling, in which a document is chosen by a random walk on a virtual graph derived from documents. In this graph, nodes are documents; two documents are connected by an edge if they share two or more words in common. The graph is never instantiated; rather, a random walk on it can be performed by moving from a document to another by picking a pair of keywords in , running a query on a search engine and picking a random document from the results. Details may be found in the references in Section 19.7 . Exercises. Two web search engines A and B each generate a large number of pages uniformly at random from their indexes. 30% of A's pages are present in B's index, while 50% of B's pages are present in A's index. What is the number of pages in A's index relative to B's?

  <TITLE>19.6 Near-duplicates and shingling</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Near-duplicates and shingling 19.5 duplication The simplest approach to detecting duplicates is to compute, for each web page, a fingerprint that is a succinct (say 64-bit) digest of the characters on that page. Then, whenever the fingerprints of two web pages are equal, we test whether the pages themselves are equal and if so declare one of them to be a duplicate copy of the other. This simplistic approach fails to capture a crucial and widespread phenomenon on the Web: near duplication. In many cases, the contents of one web page are identical to those of another except for a few characters - say, a notation showing the date and time at which the page was last modified. Even in such cases, we want to be able to declare the two pages to be close enough that we only index one copy. Short of exhaustively comparing all pairs of web pages, an infeasible task at the scale of billions of pages, how can we detect and filter out such near duplicates? We now describe a solution to the problem of detecting near-duplicate web pages. The answer lies in a technique known as shingling . Given a positive integer and a sequence of terms in a document , define the -shingles of to be the set of all consecutive sequences of terms in . As an example, consider the following text: a rose is a rose is a rose. The 4-shingles for this text ( is a typical value used in the detection of near-duplicate web pages) are a rose is a, rose is a rose and is a rose is. The first two of these shingles each occur twice in the text. Intuitively, two documents are near duplicates if the sets of shingles generated from them are nearly the same. We now make this intuition precise, then develop a method for efficiently computing and comparing the sets of shingles for all web pages. Let denote the set of shingles of document . Recall the Jaccard coefficient from page 3.3.4 , which measures the degree of overlap between the sets and as ; denote this by . Our test for near duplication between and is to compute this Jaccard coefficient; if it exceeds a preset threshold (say, ), we declare them near duplicates and eliminate one from indexing. However, this does not appear to have simplified matters: we still have to compute Jaccard coefficients pairwise. To avoid this, we use a form of hashing. First, we map every shingle into a hash value over a large space, say 64 bits. For , let be the corresponding set of 64-bit hash values derived from . We now invoke the following trick to detect document pairs whose sets have large Jaccard overlaps. Let be a random permutation from the 64-bit integers to the 64-bit integers. Denote by the set of permuted hash values in ; thus for each , there is a corresponding value .  Let be the smallest integer in . Then Theorem. (247)  End theorem. Proof. We give the proof in a slightly more general setting: consider a family of sets whose elements are drawn from a common universe. View the sets as columns of a matrix , with one row for each element in the universe. The element if element is present in the set that the th column represents. Let be a random permutation of the rows of ; denote by the column that results from applying to the th column. Finally, let be the index of the first row in which the column has a . We then prove that for any two columns , (248)   Figure 19.9: Two sets and ; their Jaccard coefficient is . Consider two columns as shown in Figure 19.9 . The ordered pairs of entries of and partition the rows into four types: those with 0's in both of these columns, those with a 0 in and a 1 in , those with a 1 in and a 0 in , and finally those with 1's in both of these columns. Indeed, the first four rows of Figure 19.9 exemplify all of these four types of rows. Denote by the number of rows with 0's in both columns, the second, the third and the fourth. Then, (249)  249    249 End proof. Thus, our test for the Jaccard coefficient of the shingle sets is probabilistic: we compare the computed values from different documents. If a pair coincides, we have candidate near duplicates. Repeat the process independently for 200 random permutations (a choice suggested in the literature). Call the set of the 200 resulting values of the sketch of . We can then estimate the Jaccard coefficient for any pair of documents to be ; if this exceeds a preset threshold, we declare that and are similar. How can we quickly compute for all pairs ? Indeed, how do we represent all pairs of documents that are similar, without incurring a blowup that is quadratic in the number of documents? First, we use fingerprints to remove all but one copy of identical documents. We may also remove common HTML tags and integers from the shingle computation, to eliminate shingles that occur very commonly in documents without telling us anything about duplication. Next we use a union-find algorithm to create clusters that contain documents that are similar. To do this, we must accomplish a crucial step: going from the set of sketches to the set of pairs such that and are similar. To this end, we compute the number of shingles in common for any pair of documents whose sketches have any members in common. We begin with the list sorted by pairs. For each , we can now generate all pairs for which is present in both their sketches. From these we can compute, for each pair with non-zero sketch overlap, a count of the number of values they have in common. By applying a preset threshold, we know which pairs have heavily overlapping sketches. For instance, if the threshold were 80%, we would need the count to be at least 160 for any . As we identify such pairs, we run the union-find to group documents into near-duplicate ``syntactic clusters''. This is essentially a variant of the single-link clustering algorithm introduced in Section 17.2 (page ). One final trick cuts down the space needed in the computation of for pairs , which in principle could still demand space quadratic in the number of documents. To remove from consideration those pairs whose sketches have few shingles in common, we preprocess the sketch for each document as follows: sort the in the sketch, then shingle this sorted sequence to generate a set of super-shingles for each document. If two documents have a super-shingle in common, we proceed to compute the precise value of . This again is a heuristic but can be highly effective in cutting down the number of pairs for which we accumulate the sketch overlap counts. Exercises. Web search engines A and B each crawl a random subset of the same size of the Web. Some of the pages crawled are duplicates - exact textual copies of each other at different URLs. Assume that duplicates are distributed uniformly amongst the pages crawled by A and B. Further, assume that a duplicate is a page that has exactly two copies - no pages have more than two copies. A indexes pages without duplicate elimination whereas B indexes only one copy of each duplicate page. The two random subsets have the same size before duplicate elimination. If, 45% of A's indexed URLs are present in B's index, while 50% of B's indexed URLs are present in A's index, what fraction of the Web consists of pages that do not have a duplicate? Instead of using the process depicted in Figure 19.8 , consider instead the following process for estimating the Jaccard coefficient of the overlap between two sets and . We pick a random subset of the elements of the universe from which and are drawn; this corresponds to picking a random subset of the rows of the matrix in the proof. We exhaustively compute the Jaccard coefficient of these random subsets. Why is this estimate an unbiased estimator of the Jaccard coefficient for and ? Explain why this estimator would be very difficult to use in practice.

   Features a crawler must provide must should Robustness: The Web contains servers that create spider traps, which are generators of web pages that mislead crawlers into getting stuck fetching an infinite number of pages in a particular domain. Crawlers must be designed to be resilient to such traps. Not all such traps are malicious; some are the inadvertent side-effect of faulty website development. Politeness: Web servers have both implicit and explicit policies regulating the rate at which a crawler can visit them. These politeness policies must be respected.

  <TEXT>
   Features a crawler should provide Distributed: The crawler should have the ability to execute in a distributed fashion across multiple machines. Scalable: The crawler architecture should permit scaling up the crawl rate by adding extra machines and bandwidth. Performance and efficiency: The crawl system should make efficient use of various system resources including processor, storage and network bandwidth. Quality: Given that a significant fraction of all web pages are of poor utility for serving user query needs, the crawler should be biased towards fetching ``useful'' pages first. Freshness: In many applications, the crawler should operate in continuous mode: it should obtain fresh copies of previously fetched pages. A search engine crawler, for instance, can thus ensure that the search engine's index contains a fairly current representation of each indexed web page. For such continuous crawling, a crawler should be able to crawl a page with a frequency that approximates the rate of change of that page. Extensible: Crawlers should be designed to be extensible in many ways - to cope with new data formats, new fetch protocols, and so on. This demands that the crawler architecture be modular.

  <TEXT>
   Crawling seed set 4 5 URL frontier 19 This seemingly simple recursive traversal of the web graph is complicated by the many demands on a practical web crawling system: the crawler has to be distributed, scalable, efficient, polite, robust and extensible while fetching pages of high quality. We examine the effects of each of these issues. Our treatment follows the design of the Mercator crawler that has formed the basis of a number of research and commercial crawlers. As a reference point, fetching a billion pages (a small fraction of the static Web at present) in a month-long crawl requires fetching several hundred pages each second. We will see how to use a multi-threaded design to address several bottlenecks in the overall crawler system in order to attain this fetch rate. Before proceeding to this detailed description, we reiterate for readers who may attempt to build crawlers of some basic properties any non-professional crawler should satisfy: Only one connection should be open to any given host at a time. A waiting time of a few seconds should occur between successive requests to a host. Politeness restrictions detailed in Section 20.2.1 should be obeyed.

  <TITLE>20.2.1 Crawler architecture</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Crawler architecture The simple scheme outlined above for crawling demands several modules that fit together as shown in Figure 20.1 . The URL frontier, containing URLs yet to be fetched in the current crawl (in the case of continuous crawling, a URL may have been fetched previously but is back in the frontier for re-fetching). We describe this further in Section 20.2.3 . A DNS resolution module that determines the web server from which to fetch the page specified by a URL. We describe this further in Section 20.2.2 . A fetch module that uses the http protocol to retrieve the web page at a URL. A parsing module that extracts the text and set of links from a fetched web page. A duplicate elimination module that determines whether an extracted link is already in the URL frontier or has recently been fetched.  Figure 20.1: The basic crawler architecture. Crawling is performed by anywhere from one to potentially hundreds of threads, each of which loops through the logical cycle in Figure 20.1 . These threads may be run in a single process, or be partitioned amongst multiple processes running at different nodes of a distributed system. We begin by assuming that the URL frontier is in place and non-empty and defer our description of the implementation of the URL frontier to Section 20.2.3 . We follow the progress of a single URL through the cycle of being fetched, passing through various checks and filters, then finally (for continuous crawling) being returned to the URL frontier. A crawler thread begins by taking a URL from the frontier and fetching the web page at that URL, generally using the http protocol. The fetched page is then written into a temporary store, where a number of operations are performed on it. Next, the page is parsed and the text as well as the links in it are extracted. The text (with any tag information - e.g., terms in boldface) is passed on to the indexer. Link information including anchor text is also passed on to the indexer for use in ranking in ways that are described in Chapter 21 . In addition, each extracted link goes through a series of tests to determine whether the link should be added to the URL frontier. First, the thread tests whether a web page with the same content has already been seen at another URL. The simplest implementation for this would use a simple fingerprint such as a checksum (placed in a store labeled "Doc FP's" in Figure 20.1 ). A more sophisticated test would use shingles instead of fingerprints, as described in Chapter 19 . Next, a URL filter is used to determine whether the extracted URL should be excluded from the frontier based on one of several tests. For instance, the crawl may seek to exclude certain domains (say, all .com URLs) - in this case the test would simply filter out the URL if it were from the .com domain. A similar test could be inclusive rather than exclusive. Many hosts on the Web place certain portions of their websites off-limits to crawling, under a standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol , except for the robot called ``searchengine''.  User-agent: *
Disallow: /yoursite/temp/

User-agent: searchengine
Disallow: The robots.txt file must be fetched from a website in order to test whether the URL under consideration passes the robot restrictions, and can therefore be added to the URL frontier. Rather than fetch it afresh for testing on each URL to be added to the frontier, a cache can be used to obtain a recently fetched copy of the file for the host. This is especially important since many of the links extracted from a page fall within the host from which the page was fetched and therefore can be tested against the host's robots.txt file. Thus, by performing the filtering during the link extraction process, we would have especially high locality in the stream of hosts that we need to test for robots.txt files, leading to high cache hit rates. Unfortunately, this runs afoul of webmasters' politeness expectations. A URL (particularly one referring to a low-quality or rarely changing document) may be in the frontier for days or even weeks. If we were to perform the robots filtering before adding such a URL to the frontier, its robots.txt file could have changed by the time the URL is dequeued from the frontier and fetched. We must consequently perform robots-filtering immediately before attempting to fetch a web page. As it turns out, maintaining a cache of robots.txt files is still highly effective; there is sufficient locality even in the stream of URLs dequeued from the URL frontier. Next, a URL should be normalized in the following sense: often the HTML encoding of a link from a web page indicates the target of that link relative to the page . Thus, there is a relative link encoded thus in the HTML of the page en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page: Disclaimers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer Finally, the URL is checked for duplicate elimination: if the URL is already in the frontier or (in the case of a non-continuous crawl) already crawled, we do not add it to the frontier. When the URL is added to the frontier, it is assigned a priority based on which it is eventually removed from the frontier for fetching. The details of this priority queuing are in Section 20.2.3 . Certain housekeeping tasks are typically performed by a dedicated thread. This thread is generally quiescent except that it wakes up once every few seconds to log crawl progress statistics (URLs crawled, frontier size, etc.), decide whether to terminate the crawl, or (once every few hours of crawling) checkpoint the crawl. In checkpointing, a snapshot of the crawler's state (say, the URL frontier) is committed to disk. In the event of a catastrophic crawler failure, the crawl is restarted from the most recent checkpoint.   Subsections Distributing the crawler

  <TITLE>20.2.2 DNS resolution</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   DNS resolution  IP address  DNS resolution Domain Name Service  DNS server en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System DNS resolution is a well-known bottleneck in web crawling. Due to the distributed nature of the Domain Name Service, DNS resolution may entail multiple requests and round-trips across the internet, requiring seconds and sometimes even longer. Right away, this puts in jeopardy our goal of fetching several hundred documents a second. A standard remedy is to introduce caching: URLs for which we have recently performed DNS lookups are likely to be found in the DNS cache, avoiding the need to go to the DNS servers on the internet. However, obeying politeness constraints (see Section 20.2.3 ) limits the of cache hit rate. There is another important difficulty in DNS resolution; the lookup implementations in standard libraries (likely to be used by anyone developing a crawler) are generally synchronous. This means that once a request is made to the Domain Name Service, other crawler threads at that node are blocked until the first request is completed. To circumvent this, most web crawlers implement their own DNS resolver as a component of the crawler. Thread executing the resolver code sends a message to the DNS server and then performs a timed wait: it resumes either when being signaled by another thread or when a set time quantum expires. A single, separate DNS thread listens on the standard DNS port (port 53) for incoming response packets from the name service. Upon receiving a response, it signals the appropriate crawler thread (in this case, ) and hands it the response packet if has not yet resumed because its time quantum has expired. A crawler thread that resumes because its wait time quantum has expired retries for a fixed number of attempts, sending out a new message to the DNS server and performing a timed wait each time; the designers of Mercator recommend of the order of five attempts. The time quantum of the wait increases exponentially with each of these attempts; Mercator started with one second and ended with roughly 90 seconds, in consideration of the fact that there are host names that take tens of seconds to resolve.

  <TITLE>20.2.3 The URL frontier</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The URL frontier The second consideration is politeness: we must avoid repeated fetch requests to a host within a short time span. The likelihood of this is exacerbated because of a form of locality of reference: many URLs link to other URLs at the same host. As a result, a URL frontier implemented as a simple priority queue might result in a burst of fetch requests to a host. This might occur even if we were to constrain the crawler so that at most one thread could fetch from any single host at any time. A common heuristic is to insert a gap between successive fetch requests to a host that is an order of magnitude larger than the time taken for the most recent fetch from that host.   Figure 20.3 shows a polite and prioritizing implementation of a URL frontier. Its goals are to ensure that (i) only one connection is open at a time to any host; (ii) a waiting time of a few seconds occurs between successive requests to a host and (iii) high-priority pages are crawled preferentially. The two major sub-modules are a set of front queues in the upper portion of the figure, and a set of back queues in the lower part; all of these are FIFO queues. The front queues implement the prioritization, while the back queues implement politeness. In the flow of a URL added to the frontier as it makes its way through the front and back queues, a prioritizer first assigns to the URL an integer priority between 1 and based on its fetch history (taking into account the rate at which the web page at this URL has changed between previous crawls). For instance, a document that has exhibited frequent change would be assigned a higher priority. Other heuristics could be application-dependent and explicit - for instance, URLs from news services may always be assigned the highest priority. Now that it has been assigned priority , the URL is now appended to the th of the front queues. Each of the back queues maintains the following invariants: (i) it is non-empty while the crawl is in progress and (ii) it only contains URLs from a single host. An auxiliary table (Figure 20.4 ) is used to maintain the mapping from hosts to back queues. Whenever a back-queue is empty and is being re-filled from a front-queue, table must be updated accordingly. In addition, we maintain a heap with one entry for each back queue, the entry being the earliest time at which the host corresponding to that queue can be contacted again.  Figure 20.4: Example of an auxiliary hosts-to-back queues table. A crawler thread requesting a URL from the frontier extracts the root of this heap and (if necessary) waits until the corresponding time entry . It then takes the URL at the head of the back queue corresponding to the extracted heap root, and proceeds to fetch the URL . After fetching , the calling thread checks whether is empty. If so, it picks a front queue and extracts from its head a URL . The choice of front queue is biased (usually by a random process) towards queues of higher priority, ensuring that URLs of high priority flow more quickly into the back queues. We examine to check whether there is already a back queue holding URLs from its host. If so, is added to that queue and we reach back to the front queues to find another candidate URL for insertion into the now-empty queue . This process continues until is non-empty again. In any case, the thread inserts a heap entry for with a new earliest time based on the properties of the URL in that was last fetched (such as when its host was last contacted as well as the time taken for the last fetch), then continues with its processing. For instance, the new entry could be the current time plus ten times the last fetch time. The number of front queues, together with the policy of assigning priorities and picking queues, determines the priority properties we wish to build into the system. The number of back queues governs the extent to which we can keep all crawl threads busy while respecting politeness. The designers of Mercator recommend a rough rule of three times as many back queues as crawler threads. On a Web-scale crawl, the URL frontier may grow to the point where it demands more memory at a node than is available. The solution is to let most of the URL frontier reside on disk. A portion of each queue is kept in memory, with more brought in from disk as it is drained in memory. Exercises. Why is it better to partition hosts (rather than individual URLs) between the nodes of a distributed crawl system? Why should the host splitter precede the Duplicate URL Eliminator? In the preceding discussion we encountered two recommended ``hard constants'' - the increment on being ten times the last fetch time, and the number of back queues being three times the number of crawl threads. How are these two constants related?

  <TITLE>20.3 Distributing indexes</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Distributing indexes In Section 4.4 we described distributed indexing. We now consider the distribution of the index across a large computer cluster that supports querying. Two obvious alternative index implementations suggest themselves: partitioning by terms , also known as global index organization, and partitioning by documents , also know as local index organization. In the former, the dictionary of index terms is partitioned into subsets, each subset residing at a node. Along with the terms at a node, we keep the postings for those terms. A query is routed to the nodes corresponding to its query terms. In principle, this allows greater concurrency since a stream of queries with different query terms would hit different sets of machines. In practice, partitioning indexes by vocabulary terms turns out to be non-trivial. Multi-word queries require the sending of long postings lists between sets of nodes for merging, and the cost of this can outweigh the greater concurrency. Load balancing the partition is governed not by an a priori analysis of relative term frequencies, but rather by the distribution of query terms and their co-occurrences, which can drift with time or exhibit sudden bursts. Achieving good partitions is a function of the co-occurrences of query terms and entails the clustering of terms to optimize objectives that are not easy to quantify. Finally, this strategy makes implementation of dynamic indexing more difficult. A more common implementation is to partition by documents: each node contains the index for a subset of all documents. Each query is distributed to all nodes, with the results from various nodes being merged before presentation to the user. This strategy trades more local disk seeks for less inter-node communication. One difficulty in this approach is that global statistics used in scoring - such as idf - must be computed across the entire document collection even though the index at any single node only contains a subset of the documents. These are computed by distributed ``background'' processes that periodically refresh the node indexes with fresh global statistics. How do we decide the partition of documents to nodes? Based on our development of the crawler architecture in Section 20.2.1 , one simple approach would be to assign all pages from a host to a single node. This partitioning could follow the partitioning of hosts to crawler nodes. A danger of such partitioning is that on many queries, a preponderance of the results would come from documents at a small number of hosts (and hence a small number of index nodes). A hash of each URL into the space of index nodes results in a more uniform distribution of query-time computation across nodes. At query time, the query is broadcast to each of the nodes, with the top results from each node being merged to find the top documents for the query. A common implementation heuristic is to partition the document collection into indexes of documents that are more likely to score highly on most queries (using, for instance, techniques in Chapter 21 ) and low-scoring indexes with the remaining documents. We only search the low-scoring indexes when there are too few matches in the high-scoring indexes, as described in Section 7.2.1 .

  <TITLE>20.4 Connectivity servers</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Connectivity servers 21  connectivity server  connectivity queries which URLs link to a given URL? which URLs does a given URL link to? link analysis 21 Suppose that the Web had four billion pages, each with ten links to other pages. In the simplest form, we would require 32 bits or 4 bytes to specify each end (source and destination) of each link, requiring a total of (250)  5 We assume that each web page is represented by a unique integer; the specific scheme used to assign these integers is described below. We build an adjacency table that resembles an inverted index: it has a row for each web page, with the rows ordered by the corresponding integers. The row for any page contains a sorted list of integers, each corresponding to a web page that links to . This table permits us to respond to queries of the form which pages link to ? In similar fashion we build a table whose entries are the pages linked to by . This table representation cuts the space taken by the naive representation (in which we explicitly represent each link by its two end points, each a 32-bit integer) by 50%. Our description below will focus on the table for the links from each page; it should be clear that the techniques apply just as well to the table of links to each page. To further reduce the storage for the table, we exploit several ideas: Similarity between lists: Many rows of the table have many entries in common. Thus, if we explicitly represent a prototype row for several similar rows, the remainder can be succinctly expressed in terms of the prototypical row. Locality: many links from a page go to ``nearby'' pages - pages on the same host, for instance. This suggests that in encoding the destination of a link, we can often use small integers and thereby save space. We use gap encodings in sorted lists: rather than store the destination of each link, we store the offset from the previous entry in the row. In a lexicographic ordering of all URLs, we treat each URL as an alphanumeric string and sort these strings. Figure 20.5 shows a segment of this sorted order. For a true lexicographic sort of web pages, the domain name part of the URL should be inverted, so that www.stanford.edu becomes edu.stanford.www, but this is not necessary here since we are mainly concerned with links local to a single host.  Figure 20.5: A lexicographically ordered set of URLs. To each URL, we assign its position in this ordering as the unique identifying integer. Figure 20.6 shows an example of such a numbering and the resulting table. In this example sequence, www.stanford.edu/biology is assigned the integer 2 since it is second in the sequence. We next exploit a property that stems from the way most websites are structured to get similarity and locality. Most websites have a template with a set of links from each page in the site to a fixed set of pages on the site (such as its copyright notice, terms of use, and so on). In this case, the rows corresponding to pages in a website will have many table entries in common. Moreover, under the lexicographic ordering of URLs, it is very likely that the pages from a website appear as contiguous rows in the table.  Figure 20.6: A four-row segment of the table of links. We adopt the following strategy: we walk down the table, encoding each table row in terms of the seven preceding rows. In the example of Figure 20.6, we could encode the fourth row as ``the same as the row at offset 2 (meaning, two rows earlier in the table), with 9 replaced by 8''. This requires the specification of the offset, the integer(s) dropped (in this case 9) and the integer(s) added (in this case 8). The use of only the seven preceding rows has two advantages: (i) the offset can be expressed with only 3 bits; this choice is optimized empirically (the reason for seven and not eight preceding rows is the subject of Exercise 20.4) and (ii) fixing the maximum offset to a small value like seven avoids having to perform an expensive search among many candidate prototypes in terms of which to express the current row. What if none of the preceding seven rows is a good prototype for expressing the current row? This would happen, for instance, at each boundary between different websites as we walk down the rows of the table. In this case we simply express the row as starting from the empty set and ``adding in'' each integer in that row. By using gap encodings to store the gaps (rather than the actual integers) in each row, and encoding these gaps tightly based on the distribution of their values, we obtain further space reduction. In experiments mentioned in Section 20.5 , the series of techniques outlined here appears to use as few as 3 bits per link, on average - a dramatic reduction from the 64 required in the naive representation. While these ideas give us a representation of sizable web graphs that comfortably fit in memory, we still need to support connectivity queries. What is entailed in retrieving from this representation the set of links from a page? First, we need an index lookup from (a hash of) the URL to its row number in the table. Next, we need to reconstruct these entries, which may be encoded in terms of entries in other rows. This entails following the offsets to reconstruct these other rows - a process that in principle could lead through many levels of indirection. In practice however, this does not happen very often. A heuristic for controlling this can be introduced into the construction of the table: when examining the preceding seven rows as candidates from which to model the current row, we demand a threshold of similarity between the current row and the candidate prototype. This threshold must be chosen with care. If the threshold is set too high, we seldom use prototypes and express many rows afresh. If the threshold is too low, most rows get expressed in terms of prototypes, so that at query time the reconstruction of a row leads to many levels of indirection through preceding prototypes. Exercises. We noted that expressing a row in terms of one of seven preceding rows allowed us to use no more than three bits to specify which of the preceding rows we are using as prototype. Why seven and not eight preceding rows? (Hint: consider the case when none of the preceding seven rows is a good prototype.) We noted that for the scheme in Section 20.4 , decoding the links incident on a URL could result in many levels of indirection. Construct an example in which the number of levels of indirection grows linearly with the number of URLs.

In the future, the convention for addresses (collectively known as the internet address space) is likely to use a new standard known as IPv6 (http://www.ipv6.org/). Tomasic and Garcia-Molina (1993) and Jeong and Omiecinski (1995) are key early papers evaluating term partitioning versus document partitioning for distributed indexes. Document partitioning is found to be superior, at least when the distribution of terms is skewed, as it typically is in practice. This result has generally been confirmed in more recent work (MacFarlane et al., 2000). But the outcome depends on the details of the distributed system; at least one thread of work has reached the opposite conclusion (Ribeiro-Neto and Barbosa, 1998, Badue et al., 2001). Sornil (2001) argues for a partitioning scheme that is a hybrid between term and document partitioning. Barroso et al. (2003) describe the distribution methods used at Google. The first implementation of a connectivity server was described by Bharat et al. (1998). The scheme discussed in this chapter, currently believed to be the best published scheme (achieving as few as 3 bits per link for encoding), is described in a series of papers by Boldi and Vigna (2004b;a).

  <TITLE>Chapter 21 Link analysis</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Link analysis The analysis of hyperlinks and the graph structure of the Web has been instrumental in the development of web search. In this chapter we focus on the use of hyperlinks for ranking web search results. Such link analysis is one of many factors considered by web search engines in computing a composite score for a web page on any given query. We begin by reviewing some basics of the Web as a graph in Section 21.1 , then proceed to the technical development of the elements of link analysis for ranking. Link analysis for web search has intellectual antecedents in the field of citation analysis, aspects of which overlap with an area known as bibliometrics. These disciplines seek to quantify the influence of scholarly articles by analyzing the pattern of citations amongst them. Much as citations represent the conferral of authority from a scholarly article to others, link analysis on the Web treats hyperlinks from a web page to another as a conferral of authority. Clearly, not every citation or hyperlink implies such authority conferral; for this reason, simply measuring the quality of a web page by the number of in-links (citations from other pages) is not robust enough. For instance, one may contrive to set up multiple web pages pointing to a target web page, with the intent of artificially boosting the latter's tally of in-links. This phenomenon is referred to as link spam . Nevertheless, the phenomenon of citation is prevalent and dependable enough that it is feasible for web search engines to derive useful signals for ranking from more sophisticated link analysis. Link analysis also proves to be a useful indicator of what page(s) to crawl next while crawling the web; this is done by using link analysis to guide the priority assignment in the front queues of Chapter 20 . Section 21.1 develops the basic ideas underlying the use of the web graph in link analysis. and 21.3 then develop two distinct methods for link analysis, PageRank and HITS.

   The Web as a graph 19.2.1 19.2 The anchor text pointing to page B is a good description of page B. The hyperlink from A to B represents an endorsement of page B, by the creator of page A. This is not always the case; for instance, many links amongst pages within a single website stem from the user of a common template. For instance, most corporate websites have a pointer from every page to a page containing a copyright notice - this is clearly not an endorsement. Accordingly, implementations of link analysis algorithms will typical discount such ``internal'' links.   Subsections Anchor text and the web graph

  <TEXT>
   Anchor text and the web graph Journal of the ACM. http://www.acm.org/jacm/ Journal of the ACM. http://www.acm.org/jacm/ The Web is full of instances where the page B does not provide an accurate description of itself. In many cases this is a matter of how the publishers of page B choose to present themselves; this is especially common with corporate web pages, where a web presence is a marketing statement. For example, at the time of the writing of this book the home page of the IBM corporation (http://www.ibm.com) did not contain the term computer anywhere in its HTML code, despite the fact that IBM is widely viewed as the world's largest computer maker. Similarly, the HTML code for the home page of Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com) does not at this time contain the word portal. Thus, there is often a gap between the terms in a web page, and how web users would describe that web page. Consequently, web searchers need not use the terms in a page to query for it. In addition, many web pages are rich in graphics and images, and/or embed their text in these images; in such cases, the HTML parsing performed when crawling will not extract text that is useful for indexing these pages. The ``standard IR'' approach to this would be to use the methods outlined in Chapter 9 and Section 12.4 . The insight behind anchor text is that such methods can be supplanted by anchor text, thereby tapping the power of the community of web page authors. The fact that the anchors of many hyperlinks pointing to http://www.ibm.com include the word computer can be exploited by web search engines. For instance, the anchor text terms can be included as terms under which to index the target web page. Thus, the postings for the term computer would include the document http://www.ibm.com and that for the term portal would include the document http://www.yahoo.com, using a special indicator to show that these terms occur as anchor (rather than in-page) text. As with in-page terms, anchor text terms are generally weighted based on frequency, with a penalty for terms that occur very often (the most common terms in anchor text across the Web are Click and here, using methods very similar to idf). The actual weighting of terms is determined by machine-learned scoring, as in Section 15.4.1 ; current web search engines appear to assign a substantial weighting to anchor text terms. The use of anchor text has some interesting side-effects. Searching for big blue on most web search engines returns the home page of the IBM corporation as the top hit; this is consistent with the popular nickname that many people use to refer to IBM. On the other hand, there have been (and continue to be) many instances where derogatory anchor text such as evil empire leads to somewhat unexpected results on querying for these terms on web search engines. This phenomenon has been exploited in orchestrated campaigns against specific sites. Such orchestrated anchor text may be a form of spamming, since a website can create misleading anchor text pointing to itself, to boost its ranking on selected query terms. Detecting and combating such systematic abuse of anchor text is another form of spam detection that web search engines perform. The window of text surrounding anchor text (sometimes referred to as extended anchor text) is often usable in the same manner as anchor text itself; consider for instance the fragment of web text there is good discussion of vedic scripture here. This has been considered in a number of settings and the useful width of this window has been studied; see Section 21.4 for references. Exercises. Is it always possible to follow directed edges (hyperlinks) in the web graph from any node (web page) to any other? Why or why not? Find an instance of misleading anchor-text on the Web. Given the collection of anchor-text phrases for a web page , suggest a heuristic for choosing one term or phrase from this collection that is most descriptive of . Does your heuristic in the previous exercise take into account a single domain repeating anchor text for from multiple pages in ?

   PageRank  PageRank 6.3 7.2.2 15.4.1 Consider a random surfer who begins at a web page (a node of the web graph) and executes a random walk on the Web as follows. At each time step, the surfer proceeds from his current page A to a randomly chosen web page that A hyperlinks to. Figure 21.1 shows the surfer at a node A, out of which there are three hyperlinks to nodes B, C and D; the surfer proceeds at the next time step to one of these three nodes, with equal probabilities 1/3.  Figure 21.1: The random surfer at node A proceeds with probability 1/3 to each of B, C and D. As the surfer proceeds in this random walk from node to node, he visits some nodes more often than others; intuitively, these are nodes with many links coming in from other frequently visited nodes. The idea behind PageRank is that pages visited more often in this walk are more important. What if the current location of the surfer, the node A, has no out-links? To address this we introduce an additional operation for our random surfer: the teleport operation. In the teleport operation the surfer jumps from a node to any other node in the web graph. This could happen because he types an address into the URL bar of his browser. The destination of a teleport operation is modeled as being chosen uniformly at random from all web pages. In other words, if is the total number of nodes in the web graph, the teleport operation takes the surfer to each node with probability . The surfer would also teleport to his present position with probability . In assigning a PageRank score to each node of the web graph, we use the teleport operation in two ways: (1) When at a node with no out-links, the surfer invokes the teleport operation. (2) At any node that has outgoing links, the surfer invokes the teleport operation with probability and the standard random walk (follow an out-link chosen uniformly at random as in Figure 21.1 ) with probability , where is a fixed parameter chosen in advance. Typically, might be 0.1. In Section 21.2.1 , we will use the theory of Markov chains to argue that when the surfer follows this combined process (random walk plus teleport) he visits each node of the web graph a fixed fraction of the time that depends on (1) the structure of the web graph and (2) the value of . We call this value the PageRank of and will show how to compute this value in Section 21.2.2 .   Subsections Markov chains Definition: The PageRank computation Topic-specific PageRank

   Markov chains discrete-time stochastic process:  states A Markov chain is characterized by an transition probability matrix each of whose entries is in the interval ; the entries in each row of add up to 1. The Markov chain can be in one of the states at any given time-step; then, the entry tells us the probability that the state at the next time-step is , conditioned on the current state being . Each entry is known as a transition probability and depends only on the current state ; this is known as the Markov property. Thus, by the Markov property, (251)   (252)  252  stochastic matrix  principal left eigenvector In a Markov chain, the probability distribution of next states for a Markov chain depends only on the current state, and not on how the Markov chain arrived at the current state. Figure 21.2 shows a simple Markov chain with three states. From the middle state A, we proceed with (equal) probabilities of 0.5 to either B or C. From either B or C, we proceed with probability 1 to A. The transition probability matrix of this Markov chain is then  (253)   Figure 21.2: A simple Markov chain with three states; the numbers on the links indicate the transition probabilities. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector : a vector all of whose entries are in the interval , and the entries add up to 1. An -dimensional probability vector each of whose components corresponds to one of the states of a Markov chain can be viewed as a probability distribution over its states. For our simple Markov chain of Figure 21.2 , the probability vector would have 3 components that sum to 1. We can view a random surfer on the web graph as a Markov chain, with one state for each web page, and each transition probability representing the probability of moving from one web page to another. The teleport operation contributes to these transition probabilities. The adjacency matrix of the web graph is defined as follows: if there is a hyperlink from page to page , then , otherwise . We can readily derive the transition probability matrix for our Markov chain from the matrix : If a row of has no 1's, then replace each element by 1/N. For all other rows proceed as follows. Divide each 1 in by the number of 1's in its row. Thus, if there is a row with three 1's, then each of them is replaced by . Multiply the resulting matrix by . Add to every entry of the resulting matrix, to obtain . We can depict the probability distribution of the surfer's position at any time by a probability vector . At the surfer may begin at a state whose corresponding entry in is 1 while all others are zero. By definition, the surfer's distribution at is given by the probability vector ; at by , and so on. We will detail this process in Section 21.2.2 . We can thus compute the surfer's distribution over the states at any time, given only the initial distribution and the transition probability matrix . If a Markov chain is allowed to run for many time steps, each state is visited at a (different) frequency that depends on the structure of the Markov chain. In our running analogy, the surfer visits certain web pages (say, popular news home pages) more often than other pages. We now make this intuition precise, establishing conditions under which such the visit frequency converges to fixed, steady-state quantity. Following this, we set the PageRank of each node to this steady-state visit frequency and show how it can be computed.   Subsections Definition:

  <TITLE>21.2.2 The PageRank computation</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   The PageRank computation 214     (255)  The entries in the principal eigenvector are the steady-state probabilities of the random walk with teleporting, and thus the PageRank values for the corresponding web pages. We may interpret Equation 255 as follows: if is the probability distribution of the surfer across the web pages, he remains in the steady-state distribution . Given that is the steady-state distribution, we have that , so 1 is an eigenvalue of P. Thus if we were to compute the principal left eigenvector of the matrix -- the one with eigenvalue 1 -- we would have computed the PageRank values. There are many algorithms available for computing left eigenvectors; the references at the end of Chapter 18 and the present chapter are a guide to these. We give here a rather elementary method, sometimes known as power iteration. If is the initial distribution over the states, then the distribution at time is . As grows large, we would expect that the distribution is very similar to the distribution , since for large we would expect the Markov chain to attain its steady state. By Theorem 21.2.1 this is independent of the initial distribution . The power iteration method simulates the surfer's walk: begin at a state and run the walk for a large number of steps , keeping track of the visit frequencies for each of the states. After a large number of steps , these frequencies ``settle down'' so that the variation in the computed frequencies is below some predetermined threshold. We declare these tabulated frequencies to be the PageRank values. We consider the web graph in Exercise 21.2.3 with . The transition probability matrix of the surfer's walk with teleportation is then  (256)    (257)   (258)  21.3  Figure 21.3: The sequence of probability vectors. Continuing for several steps, we see that the distribution converges to the steady state of . In this simple example, we may directly calculate this steady-state probability distribution by observing the symmetry of the Markov chain: states 1 and 3 are symmetric, as evident from the fact that the first and third rows of the transition probability matrix in Equation 256 are identical. Postulating, then, that they both have the same steady-state probability and denoting this probability by , we know that the steady-state distribution is of the form . Now, using the identity , we solve a simple linear equation to obtain and consequently, . The PageRank values of pages (and the implicit ordering amongst them) are independent of any query a user might pose; PageRank is thus a query-independent measure of the static quality of each web page (recall such static quality measures from Section 7.1.4 ). On the other hand, the relative ordering of pages should, intuitively, depend on the query being served. For this reason, search engines use static quality measures such as PageRank as just one of many factors in scoring a web page on a query. Indeed, the relative contribution of PageRank to the overall score may again be determined by machine-learned scoring as in Section 15.4.1 .   Worked example. Consider the graph in Figure 21.4 . For a teleportation rate of 0.14 its (stochastic) transition probability matrix is: (259)   (260)  21.4      End worked example.

  <TITLE>21.2.3 Topic-specific PageRank</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Topic-specific PageRank non-uniformly Suppose our random surfer, endowed with a teleport operation as before, teleports to a random web page on the topic of sports instead of teleporting to a uniformly chosen random web page. We will not focus on how we collect all web pages on the topic of sports; in fact, we only need a non-zero subset of sports-related web pages, so that the teleport operation is feasible. This may be obtained, for instance, from a manually built directory of sports pages such as the open directory project (http://www.dmoz.org/) or that of Yahoo. Provided the set of sports-related pages is non-empty, it follows that there is a non-empty set of web pages over which the random walk has a steady-state distribution; let us denote this sports PageRank distribution by . For web pages not in , we set the PageRank values to zero. We call the topic-specific PageRank for sports.  Topic-specific PageRank.In this example we consider a user whose interests are 60% sports and 40% politics. If the teleportation probability is 10%, this user is modeled as teleporting 6% to sports pages and 4% to politics pages. We do not demand that teleporting takes the random surfer to a uniformly chosen sports page; the distribution over teleporting targets could in fact be arbitrary. In like manner we can envision topic-specific PageRank distributions for each of several topics such as science, religion, politics and so on. Each of these distributions assigns to each web page a PageRank value in the interval . For a user interested in only a single topic from among these topics, we may invoke the corresponding PageRank distribution when scoring and ranking search results. This gives us the potential of considering settings in which the search engine knows what topic a user is interested in. This may happen because users either explicitly register their interests, or because the system learns by observing each user's behavior over time. But what if a user is known to have a mixture of interests from multiple topics? For instance, a user may have an interest mixture (or profile) that is 60% sports and 40% politics; can we compute a personalized PageRank for this user? At first glance, this appears daunting: how could we possibly compute a different PageRank distribution for each user profile (with, potentially, infinitely many possible profiles)? We can in fact address this provided we assume that an individual's interests can be well-approximated as a linear combination of a small number of topic page distributions. A user with this mixture of interests could teleport as follows: determine first whether to teleport to the set of known sports pages, or to the set of known politics pages. This choice is made at random, choosing sports pages 60% of the time and politics pages 40% of the time. Once we choose that a particular teleport step is to (say) a random sports page, we choose a web page in uniformly at random to teleport to. This in turn leads to an ergodic Markov chain with a steady-state distribution that is personalized to this user's preferences over topics (see Exercise 21.2.3 ). While this idea has intuitive appeal, its implementation appears cumbersome: it seems to demand that for each user, we compute a transition probability matrix and compute its steady-state distribution. We are rescued by the fact that the evolution of the probability distribution over the states of a Markov chain can be viewed as a linear system. In Exercise 21.2.3 we will show that it is not necessary to compute a PageRank vector for every distinct combination of user interests over topics; the personalized PageRank vector for any user can be expressed as a linear combination of the underlying topic-specific PageRanks. For instance, the personalized PageRank vector for the user whose interests are 60% sports and 40% politics can be computed as (261)    Exercises. Write down the transition probability matrix for the example in Figure 21.2 . Consider a web graph with three nodes 1, 2 and 3. The links are as follows: . Write down the transition probability matrices for the surfer's walk with teleporting, for the following three values of the teleport probability: (a) ; (b) and (c) . A user of a browser can, in addition to clicking a hyperlink on the page he is currently browsing, use the back button to go back to the page from which he arrived at . Can such a user of back buttons be modeled as a Markov chain? How would we model repeated invocations of the back button? Consider a Markov chain with three states A, B and C, and transition probabilities as follows. From state A, the next state is B with probability 1. From B, the next state is either A with probability , or state C with probability . From C the next state is A with probability 1. For what values of is this Markov chain ergodic? Show that for any directed graph, the Markov chain induced by a random walk with the teleport operation is ergodic. Show that the PageRank of every page is at least . What does this imply about the difference in PageRank values (over the various pages) as becomes close to 1? For the data in Example 21.2.2, write a small routine or use a scientific calculator to compute the PageRank values stated in Equation 260. Suppose that the web graph is stored on disk as an adjacency list, in such a way that you may only query for the out-neighbors of pages in the order in which they are stored. You cannot load the graph in main memory but you may do multiple reads over the full graph. Write the algorithm for computing the PageRank in this setting. Recall the sets and introduced near the beginning of Section 21.2.3 . How does the set relate to ? Is the set always the set of all web pages? Why or why not? Is the sports PageRank of any page in at least as large as its PageRank? Consider a setting where we have two topic-specific PageRank values for each web page: a sports PageRank , and a politics PageRank . Let be the (common) teleportation probability used in computing both sets of topic-specific PageRanks. For , consider a user whose interest profile is divided between a fraction in sports and a fraction in politics. Show that the user's personalized PageRank is the steady-state distribution of a random walk in which - on a teleport step - the walk teleports to a sports page with probability and to a politics page with probability . Show that the Markov chain corresponding to the walk in Exercise 21.2.3 is ergodic and hence the user's personalized PageRank can be obtained by computing the steady-state distribution of this Markov chain. Show that in the steady-state distribution of Exercise 21.2.3, the steady-state probability for any web page equals .

  <TITLE>21.3 Hubs and Authorities</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Hubs and Authorities two  hub score  authority score This approach stems from a particular insight into the creation of web pages, that there are two primary kinds of web pages useful as results for broad-topic searches. By a broad topic search we mean an informational query such as "I wish to learn about leukemia". There are authoritative sources of information on the topic; in this case, the National Cancer Institute's page on leukemia would be such a page. We will call such pages authorities; in the computation we are about to describe, they are the pages that will emerge with high authority scores. On the other hand, there are many pages on the Web that are hand-compiled lists of links to authoritative web pages on a specific topic. These hub pages are not in themselves authoritative sources of topic-specific information, but rather compilations that someone with an interest in the topic has spent time putting together. The approach we will take, then, is to use these hub pages to discover the authority pages. In the computation we now develop, these hub pages are the pages that will emerge with high hub scores. A good hub page is one that points to many good authorities; a good authority page is one that is pointed to by many good hub pages. We thus appear to have a circular definition of hubs and authorities; we will turn this into an iterative computation. Suppose that we have a subset of the web containing good hub and authority pages, together with the hyperlinks amongst them. We will iteratively compute a hub score and an authority score for every web page in this subset, deferring the discussion of how we pick this subset until Section 21.3.1 . For a web page in our subset of the web, we use to denote its hub score and its authority score. Initially, we set for all nodes . We also denote by the existence of a hyperlink from to . The core of the iterative algorithm is a pair of updates to the hub and authority scores of all pages given by Equation 262, which capture the intuitive notions that good hubs point to good authorities and that good authorities are pointed to by good hubs.  (262) (263)   262    What happens as we perform these updates iteratively, recomputing hub scores, then new authority scores based on the recomputed hub scores, and so on? Let us recast the equations Equation 262 into matrix-vector form. Let and denote the vectors of all hub and all authority scores respectively, for the pages in our subset of the web graph. Let denote the adjacency matrix of the subset of the web graph that we are dealing with: is a square matrix with one row and one column for each page in the subset. The entry is 1 if there is a hyperlink from page to page , and 0 otherwise. Then, we may write Equation 262 (264) (265)     264 264 264  (266) (267)   266 18.1   266    (268) (269)       This leads to some key consequences: The iterative updates in Equation 262 (or equivalently, Equation 264), if scaled by the appropriate eigenvalues, are equivalent to the power iteration method for computing the eigenvectors of and . Provided that the principal eigenvalue of is unique, the iteratively computed entries of and settle into unique steady-state values determined by the entries of and hence the link structure of the graph. In computing these eigenvector entries, we are not restricted to using the power iteration method; indeed, we could use any fast method for computing the principal eigenvector of a stochastic matrix. The resulting computation thus takes the following form: Assemble the target subset of web pages, form the graph induced by their hyperlinks and compute and . Compute the principal eigenvectors of and to form the vector of hub scores and authority scores . Output the top-scoring hubs and the top-scoring authorities.  HITS Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search Worked example. Assuming the query jaguar and double-weighting of links whose anchors contain the query word, the matrix for Figure 21.4 is as follows: (270)  The hub and authority vectors are:  (271)   (272)  Here, is the main authority - two hubs ( and ) are pointing to it via highly weighted jaguar links. End worked example. Since the iterative updates captured the intuition of good hubs and good authorities, the high-scoring pages we output would give us good hubs and authorities from the target subset of web pages. In Section 21.3.1 we describe the remaining detail: how do we gather a target subset of web pages around a topic such as leukemia?   Subsections Choosing the subset of the Web

  <TITLE>21.3.1 Choosing the subset of the Web</TITLE>
  <TEXT>
   Choosing the subset of the Web In assembling a subset of web pages around a topic such as leukemia, we must cope with the fact that good authority pages may not contain the specific query term leukemia. This is especially true, as we noted in Section 21.1.1 , when an authority page uses its web presence to project a certain marketing image. For instance, many pages on the IBM website are authoritative sources of information on computer hardware, even though these pages may not contain the term computer or hardware. However, a hub compiling computer hardware resources is likely to use these terms and also link to the relevant pages on the IBM website. Building on these observations, the following procedure has been suggested for compiling the subset of the Web for which to compute hub and authority scores. Given a query (say leukemia), use a text index to get all pages containing leukemia. Call this the root set of pages. Build the base set of pages, to include the root set as well as any page that either links to a page in the root set, or is linked to by a page in the root set. We then use the base set for computing hub and authority scores. The base set is constructed in this manner for three reasons: A good authority page may not contain the query text (such as computer hardware). If the text query manages to capture a good hub page in the root set, then the inclusion of all pages linked to by any page in the root set will capture all the good authorities linked to by in the base set. Conversely, if the text query manages to capture a good authority page in the root set, then the inclusion of pages which point to will bring other good hubs into the base set. In other words, the ``expansion'' of the root set into the base set enriches the common pool of good hubs and authorities. Running HITS across a variety of queries reveals some interesting insights about link analysis. Frequently, the documents that emerge as top hubs and authorities include languages other than the language of the query. These pages were presumably drawn into the base set, following the assembly of the root set. Thus, some elements of cross-language retrieval (where a query in one language retrieves documents in another) are evident here; interestingly, this cross-language effect resulted purely from link analysis, with no linguistic translation taking place. We conclude this section with some notes on implementing this algorithm. The root set consists of all pages matching the text query; in fact, implementations (see the references in Section 21.4 ) suggest that it suffices to use 200 or so web pages for the root set, rather than all pages matching the text query. Any algorithm for computing eigenvectors may be used for computing the hub/authority score vector. In fact, we need not compute the exact values of these scores; it suffices to know the relative values of the scores so that we may identify the top hubs and authorities. To this end, it is possible that a small number of iterations of the power iteration method yields the relative ordering of the top hubs and authorities. Experiments have suggested that in practice, about five iterations of Equation 262 yield fairly good results. Moreover, since the link structure of the web graph is fairly sparse (the average web page links to about ten others), we do not perform these as matrix-vector products but rather as additive updates as in Equation 262.  Figure: A sample run of HITS on the query japan elementary schools. Figure 21.6 shows the results of running HITS on the query japan elementary schools. The figure shows the top hubs and authorities; each row lists the title tag from the corresponding HTML page. Because the resulting string is not necessarily in Latin characters, the resulting print is (in many cases) a string of gibberish. Each of these corresponds to a web page that does not use Latin characters, in this case very likely pages in Japanese. There also appear to be pages in other non-English languages, which seems surprising given that the query string is in English. In fact, this result is emblematic of the functioning of HITS - following the assembly of the root set, the (English) query string is ignored. The base set is likely to contain pages in other languages, for instance if an English-language hub page links to the Japanese-language home pages of Japanese elementary schools. Because the subsequent computation of the top hubs and authorities is entirely link-based, some of these non-English pages will appear among the top hubs and authorities. Exercises. If all the hub and authority scores are initialized to 1, what is the hub/authority score of a node after one iteration? How would you interpret the entries of the matrices and ? What is the connection to the co-occurrence matrix in Chapter 18 ? What are the principal eigenvalues of and ? Figure: Web graph for Exercise 21.3.1 . For the web graph in Figure 21.7 , compute PageRank, hub and authority scores for each of the three pages. Also give the relative ordering of the 3 nodes for each of these scores, indicating any ties. PageRank: Assume that at each step of the PageRank random walk, we teleport to a random page with probability 0.1, with a uniform distribution over which particular page we teleport to. Hubs/Authorities: Normalize the hub (authority) scores so that the maximum hub (authority) score is 1. Hint 1: Using symmetries to simplify and solving with linear equations might be easier than using iterative methods. Hint 2: Provide the relative ordering (indicating any ties) of the three nodes for each of the three scoring measures.

   References and further reading Garfield (1955) is seminal in the science of citation analysis. This was built on by Pinski and Narin (1976) to develop a journal influence weight, whose definition is remarkably similar to that of the PageRank measure. The use of anchor text as an aid to searching and ranking stems from the work of McBryan (1994). Extended anchor-text was implicit in his work, with systematic experiments reported in Chakrabarti et al. (1998). Kemeny and Snell (1976) is a classic text on Markov chains. The PageRank measure was developed in Brin and Page (1998) and in Page et al. (1998). A number of methods for the fast computation of PageRank values are surveyed in Berkhin (2005) and in Langville and Meyer (2006); the former also details how the PageRank eigenvector solution may be viewed as solving a linear system, leading to one way of solving Exercise 21.2.3 . The effect of the teleport probability has been studied by Baeza-Yates et al. (2005) and by Boldi et al. (2005). Topic-specific PageRank and variants were developed in Haveliwala (2002), Haveliwala (2003) and in Jeh and Widom (2003). Berkhin (2006a) develops an alternate view of topic-specific PageRank. Ng et al. (2001b) suggests that the PageRank score assignment is more robust than HITS in the sense that scores are less sensitive to small changes in graph topology. However, it has also been noted that the teleport operation contributes significantly to PageRank's robustness in this sense. Both PageRank and HITS can be ``spammed'' by the orchestrated insertion of links into the web graph; indeed, the Web is known to have such link farms that collude to increase the score assigned to certain pages by various link analysis algorithms. The HITS algorithm is due to Kleinberg (1999). Chakrabarti et al. (1998) developed variants that weighted links in the iterative computation based on the presence of query terms in the pages being linked and compared these to results from several web search engines. Bharat and Henzinger (1998) further developed these and other heuristics, showing that certain combinations outperformed the basic HITS algorithm. Borodin et al. (2001) provides a systematic study of several variants of the HITS algorithm. Ng et al. (2001b) introduces a notion of stability for link analysis, arguing that small changes to link topology should not lead to significant changes in the ranked list of results for a query. Numerous other variants of HITS have been developed by a number of authors, the best know of which is perhaps SALSA (Lempel and Moran, 2000).
