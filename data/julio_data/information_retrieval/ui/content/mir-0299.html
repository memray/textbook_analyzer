 15.4.6    Access When priceless objects are described by digital library image collections [300], when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users, or when there are valuable services in information manipulation (searching, ordering, reporting, summarizing, etc.)   afforded by a digital library, some method PROTOTYPES, PROJECTS, AND INTERFACES        425 of payment is often required [194, 191, 49, 251]. Though previously access to scientific literature was not viewed as a commodity as it is today [328], digital librarys clearly must manage intellectual property [559]. These services must support agreed-upon principles [586], copyright practices [705], as well as contracts and other agreements and laws [346]. Though technology is only part of the picture [822], a key to the implementation of policies for access management [30] is having trusted systems [746]. Security is one topic often ignored by the IR community. However, many aspects of security can be of fundamental importance in digital librarys [302, 301]. Just as encryption is essential to support electronic commerce, watermarking and stronger mechanisms are crucial in digital librarys to protect intellectual property rights and to control the types of access afforded to different user groups. Scenarios are important here, to ensure that suitable constraints are imposed on processing, all the way from input to output. For example, secret documents may not even be made visible in searches through metadata. On the other hand, advertising full documents as well as allowing locating and viewing metadata records is appropriate when the purpose of security is to enforce payment in ;pay by the drink' document downloading systems. Inference systems can be used for complicated rights management situations [16]. A deeper understanding of these requirements and services can be obtained by considering representative digital library projects, such as those mentioned in the next section.
