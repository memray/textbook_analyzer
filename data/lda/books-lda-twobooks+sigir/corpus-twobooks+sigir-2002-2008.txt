iir_1	Boolean retrieval The meaning of the term information retrieval can be very broad. Just getting a credit card out of your wallet so that you can type in the card number is a form of information retrieval. However, as an academic field of study, information retrieval might be defined thus: Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers).   IR can also cover other kinds of data and information problems beyond that specified in the core definition above. The term ``unstructured data'' refers to data which does not have clear, semantically overt, easy-for-a-computer structure. It is the opposite of structured data, the canonical example of which is a relational database, of the sort companies usually use to maintain product inventories and personnel records. In reality, almost no data are truly ``unstructured''. This is definitely true of all text data if you count the latent linguistic structure of human languages. But even accepting that the intended notion of structure is overt structure, most text has structure, such as headings and paragraphs and footnotes, which is commonly represented in documents by explicit markup (such as the coding underlying web pages). IR is also used to facilitate ``semistructured'' search such as finding a document where the title contains Java and the body contains threading. The field of information retrieval also covers supporting users in browsing or filtering document collections or further processing a set of retrieved documents. Given a set of documents, clustering is the task of coming up with a good grouping of the documents based on their contents. It is similar to arranging books on a bookshelf according to their topic. Given a set of topics, standing information needs, or other categories (such as suitability of texts for different age groups), classification is the task of deciding which class(es), if any, each of a set of documents belongs to. It is often approached by first manually classifying some documents and then hoping to be able to classify new documents automatically. Information retrieval systems can also be distinguished by the scale at which they operate, and it is useful to distinguish three prominent scales. In web search , the system has to provide search over billions of documents stored on millions of computers. Distinctive issues are needing to gather documents for indexing, being able to build systems that work efficiently at this enormous scale, and handling particular aspects of the web, such as the exploitation of hypertext and not being fooled by site providers manipulating page content in an attempt to boost their search engine rankings, given the commercial importance of the web. We focus on all these issues in webcharlink. At the other extreme is personal information retrieval . In the last few years, consumer operating systems have integrated information retrieval (such as Apple's Mac OS X Spotlight or Windows Vista's Instant Search). Email programs usually not only provide search but also text classification: they at least provide a spam (junk mail) filter, and commonly also provide either manual or automatic means for classifying mail so that it can be placed directly into particular folders. Distinctive issues here include handling the broad range of document types on a typical personal computer, and making the search system maintenance free and sufficiently lightweight in terms of startup, processing, and disk space usage that it can run on one machine without annoying its owner. In between is the space of enterprise, institutional, and domain-specific search , where retrieval might be provided for collections such as a corporation's internal documents, a database of patents, or research articles on biochemistry. In this case, the documents will typically be stored on centralized file systems and one or a handful of dedicated machines will provide search over the collection. This book contains techniques of value over this whole spectrum, but our coverage of some aspects of parallel and distributed search in web-scale search systems is comparatively light owing to the relatively small published literature on the details of such systems. However, outside of a handful of web search companies, a software developer is most likely to encounter the personal search and enterprise scenarios. In this chapter we begin with a very simple example of an information retrieval problem, and introduce the idea of a term-document matrix (Section 1.1 ) and the central inverted index data structure (Section 1.2 ). We will then examine the Boolean retrieval model and how Boolean queries are processed ( and 1.4 ).

iir_10	XML retrieval Information retrieval systems are often contrasted with relational databases. Traditionally, IR systems have retrieved information from unstructured text - by which we mean ``raw'' text without markup. Databases are designed for querying relational data: sets of records that have values for predefined attributes such as employee number, title and salary. There are fundamental differences between information retrieval and database systems in terms of retrieval model, data structures and query language as shown in Table 10.1 .     RDB search unstructured retrieval structured retrieval objects records unstructured documents trees with text at leaves model relational model vector space   others ? main data structure table inverted index ? queries SQL free text queries ? RDB (relational database) search, unstructured information retrieval and structured information retrieval. There is no consensus yet as to which methods work best for structured retrieval although many researchers believe that XQuery (page 10.5 ) will become the standard for structured queries.  Some highly structured text search problems are most efficiently handled by a relational database, for example, if the employee table contains an attribute for short textual job descriptions and you want to find all employees who are involved with invoicing. In this case, the SQL query: select lastname from employees where job_desc like 'invoic%'; However, many structured data sources containing text are best modeled as structured documents rather than relational data. We call the search over such structured documents structured retrieval . Queries in structured retrieval can be either structured or unstructured, but we will assume in this chapter that the collection consists only of structured documents. Applications of structured retrieval include digital libraries , patent databases , , text in which entities like persons and locations have been tagged (in a process called ) and output from office suites like OpenOffice that save documents as marked up text. In all of these applications, we want to be able to run queries that combine textual criteria with structural criteria. Examples of such queries are give me a full-length article on fast fourier transforms (digital libraries), give me patents whose claims mention RSA public key encryption and that cite US patent 4,405,829 (patents), or give me articles about sightseeing tours of the Vatican and the Coliseum (entity-tagged text). These three queries are structured queries that cannot be answered well by an unranked retrieval system. As we argued in westlaw unranked retrieval models like the Boolean model suffer from low recall. For instance, an unranked system would return a potentially large number of articles that mention the Vatican, the Coliseum and sightseeing tours without ranking the ones that are most relevant for the query first. Most users are also notoriously bad at precisely stating structural constraints. For instance, users may not know for which structured elements the search system supports search. In our example, the user may be unsure whether to issue the query as sightseeing AND (COUNTRY:Vatican OR LANDMARK:Coliseum) , as sightseeing AND (STATE:Vatican OR BUILDING:Coliseum) or in some other form. Users may also be completely unfamiliar with structured search and advanced search interfaces or unwilling to use them. In this chapter, we look at how ranked retrieval methods can be adapted to structured documents to address these problems. We will only look at one standard for encoding structured documents: Extensible Markup Language or XML , which is currently the most widely used such standard. We will not cover the specifics that distinguish XML from other types of markup such as HTML and SGML. But most of what we say in this chapter is applicable to markup languages in general. In the context of information retrieval, we are only interested in XML as a language for encoding text and documents. A perhaps more widespread use of XML is to encode non-text data. For example, we may want to export data in XML format from an enterprise resource planning system and then read them into an analytics program to produce graphs for a presentation. This type of application of XML is called data-centric because numerical and non-text attribute-value data dominate and text is usually a small fraction of the overall data. Most data-centric XML is stored in databases - in contrast to the inverted index-based methods for text-centric XML that we present in this chapter. We call XML retrieval structured retrieval in this chapter. Some researchers prefer the term semistructured retrieval to distinguish XML retrieval from database querying. We have adopted the terminology that is widespread in the XML retrieval community. For instance, the standard way of referring to XML queries is structured queries , not semistructured queries . The term structured retrieval is rarely used for database querying and it always refers to XML retrieval in this book. There is a second type of information retrieval problem that is intermediate between unstructured retrieval and querying a relational database: parametric and zone search, which we discussed in Section 6.1 (page ). In the data model of parametric and zone search, there are parametric fields (relational attributes like date or file-size) and zones - text attributes that each take a chunk of unstructured text as value, e.g., author and title in Figure 6.1 (page ). The data model is flat, that is, there is no nesting of attributes. The number of attributes is small. In contrast, XML documents have the more complex tree structure that we see in Figure 10.2 in which attributes are nested. The number of attributes and nodes is greater than in parametric and zone search. After presenting the basic concepts of XML in Section 10.1 , this chapter first discusses the challenges we face in XML retrieval (Section 10.2 ). Next we describe a vector space model for XML retrieval (Section 10.3 ). Section 10.4 presents INEX, a shared task evaluation that has been held for a number of years and currently is the most important venue for XML retrieval research. We discuss the differences between data-centric and text-centric approaches to XML in Section 10.5 .

iir_10_1	Basic XML concepts Figure 10.1: An XML document.  XML element  tag  XML attributes 10.1    Figure 10.2: The XML document in Figure 10.1 as a simplified DOM object. Figure 10.2 shows Figure 10.1 as a tree. The leaf nodes of the tree consist of text, e.g., Shakespeare, Macbeth, and Macbeth's castle. The tree's internal nodes encode either the structure of the document (title, act, and scene) or metadata functions (author). The standard for accessing and processing XML documents is the XML Document Object Model or DOM . The DOM represents elements, attributes and text within elements as nodes in a tree. Figure 10.2 is a simplified DOM representation of the XML document in Figure 10.1 .With a DOM API, we can process an XML document by starting at the root element and then descending down the tree from parents to children. XPath is a standard for enumerating paths in an XML document collection. We will also refer to paths as XML contexts or simply contexts in this chapter. Only a small subset of XPath is needed for our purposes. The XPath expression node selects all nodes of that name. Successive elements of a path are separated by slashes, so act/scene selects all scene elements whose parent is an act element. Double slashes indicate that an arbitrary number of elements can intervene on a path: play//scene selects all scene elements occurring in a play element. In Figure 10.2 this set consists of a single scene element, which is accessible via the path play, act, scene from the top. An initial slash starts the path at the root element. /play/title selects the play's title in Figure 10.1 , /play//title selects a set with two members (the play's title and the scene's title), and /scene/title selects no elements. For notational convenience, we allow the final element of a path to be a vocabulary term and separate it from the element path by the symbol #, even though this does not conform to the XPath standard. For example, title#"Macbeth" selects all titles containing the term Macbeth. We also need the concept of schema in this chapter. A schema puts constraints on the structure of allowable XML documents for a particular application. A schema for Shakespeare's plays may stipulate that scenes can only occur as children of acts and that only acts and scenes have the number attribute. Two standards for schemas for XML documents are XML DTD (document type definition) and XML Schema . Users can only write structured queries for an XML retrieval system if they have some minimal knowledge about the schema of the collection.  Figure 10.3: An XML query in NEXI format and its partial representation as a tree. A common format for XML queries is NEXI (Narrowed Extended XPath I). We give an example in Figure 10.3 . We display the query on four lines for typographical convenience, but it is intended to be read as one unit without line breaks. In particular, //section is embedded under //article. The query in Figure 10.3 specifies a search for sections about the summer holidays that are part of articles from 2001 or 2002. As in XPath double slashes indicate that an arbitrary number of elements can intervene on a path. The dot in a clause in square brackets refers to the element the clause modifies. The clause [.//yr = 2001 or .//yr = 2002] modifies //article. Thus, the dot refers to //article in this case. Similarly, the dot in [about(., summer holidays)] refers to the section that the clause modifies. The two yr conditions are relational attribute constraints. Only articles whose yr attribute is 2001 or 2002 (or that contain an element whose yr attribute is 2001 or 2002) are to be considered. The about clause is a ranking constraint: Sections that occur in the right type of article are to be ranked according to how relevant they are to the topic summer holidays.  Figure 10.4: Tree representation of XML documents and queries. We usually handle relational attribute constraints by prefiltering or postfiltering: We simply exclude all elements from the result set that do not meet the relational attribute constraints. In this chapter, we will not address how to do this efficiently and instead focus on the core information retrieval problem in XML retrieval, namely how to rank documents according to the relevance criteria expressed in the about conditions of the NEXI query. If we discard relational attributes, we can represent documents as trees with only one type of node: element nodes. In other words, we remove all attribute nodes from the XML document, such as the number attribute in Figure 10.1 . Figure 10.4 shows a subtree of the document in Figure 10.1 as an element-node tree (labeled ). We can represent queries as trees in the same way. This is a query-by-example approach to query language design because users pose queries by creating objects that satisfy the same formal description as documents. In Figure 10.4 , is a search for books whose titles score highly for the keywords Julius Caesar. is a search for books whose author elements score highly for Julius Caesar and whose title elements score highly for Gallic war.
iir_10_2	Challenges in XML retrieval In this section, we discuss a number of challenges that make structured retrieval more difficult than unstructured retrieval. Recall from page 10 the basic setting we assume in structured retrieval: the collection consists of structured documents and queries are either structured (as in Figure 10.3 ) or unstructured (e.g., summer holidays). The first challenge in structured retrieval is that users want us to return parts of documents (i.e., XML elements), not entire documents as IR systems usually do in unstructured retrieval. If we query Shakespeare's plays for Macbeth's castle, should we return the scene, the act or the entire play in Figure 10.2 ? In this case, the user is probably looking for the scene. On the other hand, an otherwise unspecified search for Macbeth should return the play of this name, not a subunit. One criterion for selecting the most appropriate part of a document is the structured document retrieval principle : Structured document retrieval principle. A system should always retrieve the most specific part of a document answering the query. title#"Macbeth" 10.2 Macbeth Macbeth's castle  Figure 10.5: Partitioning an XML document into non-overlapping indexing units. Parallel to the issue of which parts of a document to return to the user is the issue of which parts of a document to index. In Section 2.1.2 (page ), we discussed the need for a document unit or indexing unit in indexing and retrieval. In unstructured retrieval, it is usually clear what the right document unit is: files on your desktop, email messages, web pages on the web etc. In structured retrieval, there are a number of different approaches to defining the indexing unit. One approach is to group nodes into non-overlapping pseudodocuments as shown in Figure 10.5 . In the example, books, chapters and sections have been designated to be indexing units, but without overlap. For example, the leftmost dashed indexing unit contains only those parts of the tree dominated by book that are not already part of other indexing units. The disadvantage of this approach is that pseudodocuments may not make sense to the user because they are not coherent units. For instance, the leftmost indexing unit in Figure 10.5 merges three disparate elements, the class, author and title elements. We can also use one of the largest elements as the indexing unit, for example, the book element in a collection of books or the play element for Shakespeare's works. We can then postprocess search results to find for each book or play the subelement that is the best hit. For example, the query Macbeth's castle may return the play Macbeth, which we can then postprocess to identify act I, scene vii as the best-matching subelement. Unfortunately, this two-stage retrieval process fails to return the best subelement for many queries because the relevance of a whole book is often not a good predictor of the relevance of small subelements within it. Instead of retrieving large units and identifying subelements (top down), we can also search all leaves, select the most relevant ones and then extend them to larger units in postprocessing (bottom up). For the query Macbeth's castle in Figure 10.1 , we would retrieve the title Macbeth's castle in the first pass and then decide in a postprocessing step whether to return the title, the scene, the act or the play. This approach has a similar problem as the last one: The relevance of a leaf element is often not a good predictor of the relevance of elements it is contained in. The least restrictive approach is to index all elements. This is also problematic. Many XML elements are not meaningful search results, e.g., typographical elements like definitely or an ISBN number which cannot be interpreted without context. Also, indexing all elements means that search results will be highly redundant. For the query Macbeth's castle and the document in Figure 10.1 , we would return all of the play, act, scene and title elements on the path between the root node and Macbeth's castle. The leaf node would then occur four times in the result set, once directly and three times as part of other elements. We call elements that are contained within each other nested . Returning redundant nested elements in a list of returned hits is not very user-friendly. Because of the redundancy caused by nested elements it is common to restrict the set of elements that are eligible to be returned. Restriction strategies include: discard all small elements discard all element types that users do not look at (this requires a working XML retrieval system that logs this information) discard all element types that assessors generally do not judge to be relevant (if relevance assessments are available) only keep element types that a system designer or librarian has deemed to be useful search results  highlighting If the user knows the schema of the collection and is able to specify the desired type of element, then the problem of redundancy is alleviated as few nested elements have the same type. But as we discussed in the introduction, users often don't know what the name of an element in the collection is (Is the Vatican a country or a city?) or they may not know how to compose structured queries at all. A challenge in XML retrieval related to nesting is that we may need to distinguish different contexts of a term when we compute term statistics for ranking, in particular inverse document frequency ( idf ) statistics as defined in Section 6.2.1 (page ). For example, the term Gates under the node author is unrelated to an occurrence under a content node like section if used to refer to the plural of gate. It makes little sense to compute a single document frequency for Gates in this example. One solution is to compute idf for XML-contextterm pairs, e.g., to compute different idf weights for author#"Gates" and section#"Gates". Unfortunately, this scheme will run into sparse data problems - that is, many XML-context pairs occur too rarely to reliably estimate df (see Section 13.2 , page 13.2 , for a discussion of sparseness). A compromise is only to consider the parent node of the term and not the rest of the path from the root to to distinguish contexts. There are still conflations of contexts that are harmful in this scheme. For instance, we do not distinguish names of authors and names of corporations if both have the parent node name. But most important distinctions, like the example contrast author#"Gates" vs. section#"Gates", will be respected.  Figure 10.6: Schema heterogeneity: intervening nodes and mismatched names. In many cases, several different XML schemas occur in a collection since the XML documents in an IR application often come from more than one source. This phenomenon is called schema heterogeneity or schema diversity and presents yet another challenge. As illustrated in Figure 10.6 comparable elements may have different names: creator in vs. author in . In other cases, the structural organization of the schemas may be different: Author names are direct descendants of the node author in , but there are the intervening nodes firstname and lastname in . If we employ strict matching of trees, then will retrieve neither nor although both documents are relevant. Some form of approximate matching of element names in combination with semi-automatic matching of different document structures can help here. Human editing of correspondences of elements in different schemas will usually do better than automatic methods. Schema heterogeneity is one reason for query-document mismatches like and . Another reason is that users often are not familiar with the element names and the structure of the schemas of collections they search as mentioned. This poses a challenge for interface design in XML retrieval. Ideally, the user interface should expose the tree structure of the collection and allow users to specify the elements they are querying. If we take this approach, then designing the query interface in structured retrieval is more complex than a search box for keyword queries in unstructured retrieval. We can also support the user by interpreting all parent-child relationships in queries as descendant relationships with any number of intervening nodes allowed. We call such queries extended queries . The tree in Figure 10.3 and in Figure 10.6 are examples of extended queries. We show edges that are interpreted as descendant relationships as dashed arrows. In , a dashed arrow connects book and Gates. As a pseudo-XPath notation for , we adopt book//#"Gates": a book that somewhere in its structure contains the word Gates where the path from the book node to Gates can be arbitrarily long. The pseudo-XPath notation for the extended query that in addition specifies that Gates occurs in a section of the book is book//section//#"Gates". It is convenient for users to be able to issue such extended queries without having to specify the exact structural configuration in which a query term should occur - either because they do not care about the exact configuration or because they do not know enough about the schema of the collection to be able to specify it.  Figure 10.7: A structural mismatch between two queries and a document. In Figure 10.7 , the user is looking for a chapter entitled FFT (). Suppose there is no such chapter in the collection, but that there are references to books on FFT (). A reference to a book on FFT is not exactly what the user is looking for, but it is better than returning nothing. Extended queries do not help here. The extended query also returns nothing. This is a case where we may want to interpret the structural constraints specified in the query as hints as opposed to as strict conditions. As we will discuss in Section 10.4 , users prefer a relaxed interpretation of structural constraints: Elements that do not meet structural constraints perfectly should be ranked lower, but they should not be omitted from search results.
iir_10_3	A vector space model for XML retrieval  Figure 10.8: A mapping of an XML document (left) to a set of lexicalized subtrees (right). To take account of structure in retrieval in Figure 10.4 , we want a book entitled Julius Caesar to be a match for and no match (or a lower weighted match) for . In unstructured retrieval, there would be a single dimension of the vector space for Caesar. In XML retrieval, we must separate the title word Caesar from the author name Caesar. One way of doing this is to have each dimension of the vector space encode a word together with its position within the XML tree. Figure 10.8 illustrates this representation. We first take each text node (which in our setup is always a leaf) and break it into multiple nodes, one for each word. So the leaf node Bill Gates is split into two leaves Bill and Gates. Next we define the dimensions of the vector space to be lexicalized subtrees of documents - subtrees that contain at least one vocabulary term. A subset of these possible lexicalized subtrees is shown in the figure, but there are others - e.g., the subtree corresponding to the whole document with the leaf node Gates removed. We can now represent queries and documents as vectors in this space of lexicalized subtrees and compute matches between them. This means that we can use the vector space formalism from Chapter 6 for XML retrieval. The main difference is that the dimensions of vector space in unstructured retrieval are vocabulary terms whereas they are lexicalized subtrees in XML retrieval. There is a tradeoff between the dimensionality of the space and accuracy of query results. If we trivially restrict dimensions to vocabulary terms, then we have a standard vector space retrieval system that will retrieve many documents that do not match the structure of the query (e.g., Gates in the title as opposed to the author element). If we create a separate dimension for each lexicalized subtree occurring in the collection, the dimensionality of the space becomes too large. A compromise is to index all paths that end in a single vocabulary term, in other words, all XML-contextterm pairs. We call such an XML-contextterm pair a structural term and denote it by : a pair of XML-context and vocabulary term . The document in Figure 10.8 has nine structural terms. Seven are shown (e.g., "Bill" and Author#"Bill") and two are not shown: /Book/Author#"Bill" and /Book/Author#"Gates". The tree with the leaves Bill and Gates is a lexicalized subtree that is not a structural term. We use the previously introduced pseudo-XPath notation for structural terms. As we discussed in the last section users are bad at remembering details about the schema and at constructing queries that comply with the schema. We will therefore interpret all queries as extended queries - that is, there can be an arbitrary number of intervening nodes in the document for any parent-child node pair in the query. For example, we interpret in Figure 10.7 as . But we still prefer documents that match the query structure closely by inserting fewer additional nodes. We ensure that retrieval results respect this preference by computing a weight for each match. A simple measure of the similarity of a path in a query and a path in a document is the following context resemblance function CR: (52)        10.6            The final score for a document is computed as a variant of the cosine measure (Equation 24, page 6.3.1 ), which we call SIMNOMERGE for reasons that will become clear shortly. SIMNOMERGE is defined as follows: (53)          6    10.2  10.7  6.3.1 6.3.1   Figure 10.9: The algorithm for scoring documents with S IMN OM ERGE. IM O ERGE 10.9 normalizer 10.9  53  Figure 10.10: Scoring of a query with one structural term in S IMN OM ERGE. We give an example of how SIMNOMERGE computes query-document similarities in Figure 10.10 . is one of the structural terms in the query. We successively retrieve all postings lists for structural terms with the same vocabulary term . Three example postings lists are shown. For the first one, we have since the two contexts are identical. The next context has no context resemblance with : and the corresponding postings list is ignored. The context match of with is 0.63>0 and it will be processed. In this example, the highest ranking document is with a similarity of . To simplify the figure, the query weight of is assumed to be 1.0. The query-document similarity function in Figure 10.9 is called SIMNOMERGE because different XML contexts are kept separate for the purpose of weighting. An alternative similarity function is SIMMERGE which relaxes the matching conditions of query and document further in the following three ways. We collect the statistics used for computing and from all contexts that have a non-zero resemblance to (as opposed to just from as in SIMNOMERGE). For instance, for computing the document frequency of the structural term atl#"recognition", we also count occurrences of recognition in XML contexts fm/atl, article//atl etc. We modify Equation 53 by merging all structural terms in the document that have a non-zero context resemblance to a given query structural term. For example, the contexts /play/act/scene/title and /play/title in the document will be merged when matching against the query term /play/title#"Macbeth". The context resemblance function is further relaxed: Contexts have a non-zero resemblance in many cases where the definition of CR in Equation 52 returns 0. 10.6 These three changes alleviate the problem of sparse term statistics discussed in Section 10.2 and increase the robustness of the matching function against poorly posed structural queries. The evaluation of SIMNOMERGE and SIMMERGE in the next section shows that the relaxed matching conditions of SIMMERGE increase the effectiveness of XML retrieval. Exercises. Consider computing df for a structural term as the number of times that the structural term occurs under a particular parent node. Assume the following: the structural term author#"Herbert" occurs once as the child of the node squib; there are 10 squib nodes in the collection; occurs 1000 times as the child of article; there are 1,000,000 article nodes in the collection. The idf weight of then is when occurring as the child of squib and when occurring as the child of article. (i) Explain why this is not an appropriate weighting for . Why should not receive a weight that is three times higher in articles than in squibs? (ii) Suggest a better way of computing idf. Write down all the structural terms occurring in the XML document in Figure 10.8 . How many structural terms does the document in Figure 10.1 yield?
iir_10_4	Evaluation of XML retrieval   Table 10.2: INEX 2002 collection statistics. 12,107 number of documents 494 MB size 1995-2002 time of publication of articles 1,532 average number of XML nodes per document 6.9 average depth of a node 30 number of CAS topics 30 number of CO topics    Figure 10.11: Simplified schema of the documents in the INEX collection. The premier venue for research on XML retrieval is the INEX (INitiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval) program, a collaborative effort that has produced reference collections, sets of queries, and relevance judgments. A yearly INEX meeting is held to present and discuss research results. The INEX 2002 collection consisted of about 12,000 articles from IEEE journals. We give collection statistics in Table 10.2 and show part of the schema of the collection in Figure 10.11 . The IEEE journal collection was expanded in 2005. Since 2006 INEX uses the much larger English Wikipedia as a test collection. The relevance of documents is judged by human assessors using the methodology introduced in Section 8.1 (page ), appropriately modified for structured documents as we will discuss shortly. Two types of information needs or in INEX are content-only or CO topics and content-and-structure (CAS) topics. CO topics are regular keyword queries as in unstructured information retrieval. CAS topics have structural constraints in addition to keywords. We already encountered an example of a CAS topic in Figure 10.3 . The keywords in this case are summer and holidays and the structural constraints specify that the keywords occur in a section that in turn is part of an article and that this article has an embedded year attribute with value 2001 or 2002. Since CAS queries have both structural and content criteria, relevance assessments are more complicated than in unstructured retrieval. INEX 2002 defined component coverage and topical relevance as orthogonal dimensions of relevance. The component coverage dimension evaluates whether the element retrieved is ``structurally'' correct, i.e., neither too low nor too high in the tree. We distinguish four cases: Exact coverage (E). The information sought is the main topic of the component and the component is a meaningful unit of information. Too small (S). The information sought is the main topic of the component, but the component is not a meaningful (self-contained) unit of information. Too large (L). The information sought is present in the component, but is not the main topic. No coverage (N). The information sought is not a topic of the component. The topical relevance dimension also has four levels: highly relevant (3), fairly relevant (2), marginally relevant (1) and nonrelevant (0). Components are judged on both dimensions and the judgments are then combined into a digit-letter code. 2S is a fairly relevant component that is too small and 3E is a highly relevant component that has exact coverage. In theory, there are 16 combinations of coverage and relevance, but many cannot occur. For example, a nonrelevant component cannot have exact coverage, so the combination 3N is not possible. The relevance-coverage combinations are quantized as follows: (54)  8.5.1 8.5.1 Q The number of relevant components in a retrieved set of components can then be computed as: (55)  8 10.6 One flaw of measuring relevance this way is that overlap is not accounted for. We discussed the concept of marginal relevance in the context of unstructured retrieval in Section 8.5.1 (page ). This problem is worse in XML retrieval because of the problem of multiple nested elements occurring in a search result as we discussed on page 10.2 . Much of the recent focus at INEX has been on developing algorithms and evaluation measures that return non-redundant results lists and evaluate them properly. See the references in Section 10.6 .   Table 10.3: INEX 2002 results of the vector space model in Section 10.3 for content-and-structure (CAS) queries and the quantization function Q. algorithm average precision SIMNOMERGE 0.242 SIMMERGE 0.271   Table 10.3 shows two INEX 2002 runs of the vector space system we described in Section 10.3 . The better run is the SIMMERGE run, which incorporates few structural constraints and mostly relies on keyword matching. SIMMERGE's median average precision (where the median is with respect to average precision numbers over topics) is only 0.147. Effectiveness in XML retrieval is often lower than in unstructured retrieval since XML retrieval is harder. Instead of just finding a document, we have to find the subpart of a document that is most relevant to the query. Also, XML retrieval effectiveness - when evaluated as described here - can be lower than unstructured retrieval effectiveness on a standard evaluation because graded judgments lower measured performance. Consider a system that returns a document with graded relevance 0.6 and binary relevance 1 at the top of the retrieved list. Then, interpolated precision at 0.00 recall (cf. page 8.4 ) is 1.0 on a binary evaluation, but can be as low as 0.6 on a graded evaluation.   Table 10.4: A comparison of content-only and full-structure search in INEX 2003/2004.   content only full structure improvement precision at 5 0.2000 0.3265 63.3% precision at 10 0.1820 0.2531 39.1% precision at 20 0.1700 0.1796 5.6% precision at 30 0.1527 0.1531 0.3%   Table 10.3 gives us a sense of the typical performance of XML retrieval, but it does not compare structured with unstructured retrieval. Table 10.4 directly shows the effect of using structure in retrieval. The results are for a language-model-based system (cf. Chapter 12 ) that is evaluated on a subset of CAS topics from INEX 2003 and 2004. The evaluation metric is precision at as defined in Chapter 8 (page 8.4 ). The discretization function used for the evaluation maps highly relevant elements (roughly corresponding to the 3E elements defined for Q) to 1 and all other elements to 0. The content-only system treats queries and documents as unstructured bags of words. The full-structure model ranks elements that satisfy structural constraints higher than elements that do not. For instance, for the query in Figure 10.3 an element that contains the phrase summer holidays in a section will be rated higher than one that contains it in an abstract. The table shows that structure helps increase precision at the top of the results list. There is a large increase of precision at and at . There is almost no improvement at . These results demonstrate the benefits of structured retrieval. Structured retrieval imposes additional constraints on what to return and documents that pass the structural filter are more likely to be relevant. Recall may suffer because some relevant documents will be filtered out, but for precision-oriented tasks structured retrieval is superior.
iir_10_5	Text-centric vs. data-centric XML retrieval  text-centric XML   In contrast, data-centric XML mainly encodes numerical and non-text attribute-value data. When querying data-centric XML, we want to impose exact match conditions in most cases. This puts the emphasis on the structural aspects of XML documents and queries. An example is: Find employees whose salary is the same this month as it was 12 months ago. Text-centric approaches are appropriate for data that are essentially text documents, marked up as XML to capture document structure. This is becoming a de facto standard for publishing text databases since most text documents have some form of interesting structure - paragraphs, sections, footnotes etc. Examples include assembly manuals, issues of journals, Shakespeare's collected works and newswire articles. Data-centric approaches are commonly used for data collections with complex structures that mainly contain non-text data. A text-centric retrieval engine will have a hard time with proteomic data in bioinformatics or with the representation of a city map that (together with street names and other textual descriptions) forms a navigational database. Two other types of queries that are difficult to handle in a text-centric structured retrieval model are joins and ordering constraints. The query for employees with unchanged salary requires a join. The following query imposes an ordering constraint: Retrieve the chapter of the book Introduction to algorithms that follows the chapter Binomial heaps.  Relational databases are better equipped to handle many structural constraints, particularly joins (but ordering is also difficult in a database framework - the tuples of a relation in the relational calculus are not ordered). For this reason, most data-centric XML retrieval systems are extensions of relational databases (see the references in Section 10.6 ). If text fields are short, exact matching meets user needs and retrieval results in form of unordered sets are acceptable, then using a relational database for XML retrieval is appropriate.

Rahm and Bernstein (2001) give a survey of automatic schema matching that is applicable to XML. The vector-space based XML retrieval method in Section 10.3 is essentially IBM Haifa's JuruXML system as presented by Mass et al. (2003) and Carmel et al. (2003). Schlieder and Meuss (2002) and Grabs and Schek (2002) describe similar approaches. Carmel et al. (2003) represent queries as XML fragments . The trees that represent XML queries in this chapter are all XML fragments, but XML fragments also permit the operators , and phrase on content nodes. We chose to present the vector space model for XML retrieval because it is simple and a natural extension of the unstructured vector space model in Chapter 6 . But many other unstructured retrieval methods have been applied to XML retrieval with at least as much success as the vector space model. These methods include language models (cf. Chapter 12 , e.g., Kamps et al. (2004), Ogilvie and Callan (2005), List et al. (2005)), systems that use a relational database as a backend (Theobald et al., 2008;2005, Mihajlovic et al., 2005), probabilistic weighting (Lu et al., 2007), and fusion (Larson, 2005). There is currently no consensus as to what the best approach to XML retrieval is. Most early work on XML retrieval accomplished relevance ranking by focusing on individual terms, including their structural contexts, in query and document. As in unstructured information retrieval, there is a trend in more recent work to model relevance ranking as combining evidence from disparate measurements about the query, the document and their match. The combination function can be tuned manually (Sigurbjörnsson et al., 2004, Arvola et al., 2005) or trained using machine learning methods (Vittaut and Gallinari (2006), cf. mls). An active area of XML retrieval research is focused retrieval (Trotman et al., 2007), which aims to avoid returning nested elements that share one or more common subelements (cf. discussion in Section 10.2 , page 10.2 ). There is evidence that users dislike redundancy caused by nested elements (Betsi et al., 2006). Focused retrieval requires evaluation measures that penalize redundant results lists (Kazai and Lalmas, 2006, Lalmas et al., 2007). Trotman and Geva (2006) argue that XML retrieval is a form of passage retrieval . In passage retrieval (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997, Salton et al., 1993, Hearst and Plaunt, 1993, Hearst, 1997, Zobel et al., 1995), the retrieval system returns short passages instead of documents in response to a user query. While element boundaries in XML documents are cues for identifying good segment boundaries between passages, the most relevant passage often does not coincide with an XML element. In the last several years, the query format at INEX has been the NEXI standard proposed by Trotman and Sigurbjörnsson (2004). Figure 10.3 is from their paper. O'Keefe and Trotman (2004) give evidence that users cannot reliably distinguish the child and descendant axes. This justifies only permitting descendant axes in NEXI (and XML fragments). These structural constraints were only treated as ``hints'' in recent INEXes. Assessors can judge an element highly relevant even though it violates one of the structural constraints specified in a NEXI query. An alternative to structured query languages like NEXI is a more sophisticated user interface for query formulation (Tannier and Geva, 2005, van Zwol, 2006, Woodley and Geva, 2006). A broad overview of XML retrieval that covers database as well as IR approaches is given by Amer-Yahia and Lalmas (2006) and an extensive reference list on the topic can be found in (Amer-Yahia et al., 2005). Chapter 6 of Grossman and Frieder (2004) is a good introduction to structured text retrieval from a database perspective. The proposed standard for XQuery is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/ including an extension for full-text queries (Amer-Yahia et al., 2006): http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-full-text/. Work that has looked at combining the relational database and the unstructured information retrieval approaches includes (Fuhr and Rölleke, 1997), (Navarro and Baeza-Yates, 1997), (Cohen, 1998), and (Chaudhuri et al., 2006).
iir_10_7	Exercises Exercises. Find a reasonably sized XML document collection (or a collection using a markup language different from XML like HTML) on the web and download it. Jon Bosak's XML edition of Shakespeare and of various religious works at http://www.ibiblio.org/bosak/ or the first 10,000 documents of the Wikipedia are good choices. Create three CAS topics of the type shown in Figure 10.3 that you would expect to do better than analogous CO topics. Explain why an XML retrieval system would be able to exploit the XML structure of the documents to achieve better retrieval results on the topics than an unstructured retrieval system. For the collection and the topics in Exercise 10.7 , (i) are there pairs of elements and , with a subelement of such that both answer one of the topics? Find one case each where (ii) (iii) is the better answer to the query. Implement the (i) SIMMERGE (ii) SIMNOMERGE algorithm in Section 10.3 and run it for the collection and the topics in Exercise 10.7 . (iii) Evaluate the results by assigning binary relevance judgments to the first five documents of the three retrieved lists for each algorithm. Which algorithm performs better? Are all of the elements in Exercise 10.7 appropriate to be returned as hits to a user or are there elements (as in the example definitely on page 10.2 ) that you would exclude? We discussed the tradeoff between accuracy of results and dimensionality of the vector space on page 10.3 . Give an example of an information need that we can answer correctly if we index all lexicalized subtrees, but cannot answer if we only index structural terms. If we index all structural terms, what is the size of the index as a function of text size? If we index all lexicalized subtrees, what is the size of the index as a function of text size? Give an example of a query-document pair for which is larger than 1.0.
iir_11	Probabilistic information retrieval During the discussion of relevance feedback in Section 9.1.2 , we observed that if we have some known relevant and nonrelevant documents, then we can straightforwardly start to estimate the probability of a term appearing in a relevant document , and that this could be the basis of a classifier that decides whether documents are relevant or not. In this chapter, we more systematically introduce this probabilistic approach to IR, which provides a different formal basis for a retrieval model and results in different techniques for setting term weights. Users start with information needs, which they translate into query representations. Similarly, there are documents, which are converted into document representations (the latter differing at least by how text is tokenized, but perhaps containing fundamentally less information, as when a non-positional index is used). Based on these two representations, a system tries to determine how well documents satisfy information needs. In the Boolean or vector space models of IR, matching is done in a formally defined but semantically imprecise calculus of index terms. Given only a query, an IR system has an uncertain understanding of the information need. Given the query and document representations, a system has an uncertain guess of whether a document has content relevant to the information need. Probability theory provides a principled foundation for such reasoning under uncertainty. This chapter provides one answer as to how to exploit this foundation to estimate how likely it is that a document is relevant to an information need. There is more than one possible retrieval model which has a probabilistic basis. Here, we will introduce probability theory and the Probability Ranking Principle (Sections 11.1 -11.2 ), and then concentrate on the Binary Independence Model (Section 11.3 ), which is the original and still most influential probabilistic retrieval model. Finally, we will introduce related but extended methods which use term counts, including the empirically successful Okapi BM25 weighting scheme, and Bayesian Network models for IR (Section 11.4 ). In Chapter 12 , we then present the alternative probabilistic language modeling approach to IR, which has been developed with considerable success in recent years.

iir_11_1	Review of basic probability theory We hope that the reader has seen a little basic probability theory previously. We will give a very quick review; some references for further reading appear at the end of the chapter. A variable represents an event (a subset of the space of possible outcomes). Equivalently, we can represent the subset via a random variable , which is a function from outcomes to real numbers; the subset is the domain over which the random variable has a particular value. Often we will not know with certainty whether an event is true in the world. We can ask the probability of the event . For two events and , the joint event of both events occurring is described by the joint probability . The conditional probability expresses the probability of event given that event occurred. The fundamental relationship between joint and conditional probabilities is given by the chain rule : (56)  Writing for the complement of an event, we similarly have: (57)   partition rule    (58)  From these we can derive Bayes' Rule for inverting conditional probabilities: (59)    prior probability   posterior probability    likelihood    Finally, it is often useful to talk about the odds of an event, which provide a kind of multiplier for how probabilities change: (60)
iir_11_2_1	The 1/0 loss case We assume a ranked retrieval setup as in Section 6.3 , where there is a collection of documents, the user issues a query, and an ordered list of documents is returned. We also assume a binary notion of relevance as in Chapter 8 . For a query and a document in the collection, let be an indicator random variable that says whether is relevant with respect to a given query . That is, it takes on a value of 1 when the document is relevant and 0 otherwise. In context we will often write just for . Using a probabilistic model, the obvious order in which to present documents to the user is to rank documents by their estimated probability of relevance with respect to the information need: . This is the basis of the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) (van Rijsbergen, 1979, 113-114): ``If a reference retrieval system's response to each request is a ranking of the documents in the collection in order of decreasing probability of relevance to the user who submitted the request, where the probabilities are estimated as accurately as possible on the basis of whatever data have been made available to the system for this purpose, the overall effectiveness of the system to its user will be the best that is obtainable on the basis of those data.'' accuracy  1/0 loss     Bayes Optimal Decision Rule  (61)  Theorem. The PRP is optimal, in the sense that it minimizes the expected loss (also known as the Bayes risk ) under 1/0 loss. End theorem. The proof can be found in Ripley (1996). However, it requires that all probabilities are known correctly. This is never the case in practice. Nevertheless, the PRP still provides a very useful foundation for developing models of IR.
iir_11_2_2	The PRP with retrieval costs Suppose, instead, that we assume a model of retrieval costs. Let be the cost of not retrieving a relevant document and the cost of retrieval of a nonrelevant document. Then the Probability Ranking Principle says that if for a specific document and for all documents not yet retrieved (62)   8.6
iir_11_3	The Binary Independence Model The Binary Independence Model (BIM) we present in this section is the model that has traditionally been used with the PRP. It introduces some simple assumptions, which make estimating the probability function practical. Here, ``binary'' is equivalent to Boolean: documents and queries are both represented as binary term incidence vectors. That is, a document is represented by the vector where if term is present in document and if is not present in . With this representation, many possible documents have the same vector representation. Similarly, we represent by the incidence vector (the distinction between and is less central since commonly is in the form of a set of words). ``Independence'' means that terms are modeled as occurring in documents independently. The model recognizes no association between terms. This assumption is far from correct, but it nevertheless often gives satisfactory results in practice; it is the ``naive'' assumption of Naive Bayes models, discussed further in Section 13.4 (page ). Indeed, the Binary Independence Model is exactly the same as the multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes model presented in Section 13.3 (page ). In a sense this assumption is equivalent to an assumption of the vector space model, where each term is a dimension that is orthogonal to all other terms. We will first present a model which assumes that the user has a single step information need. As discussed in Chapter 9 , seeing a range of results might let the user refine their information need. Fortunately, as mentioned there, it is straightforward to extend the Binary Independence Model so as to provide a framework for relevance feedback, and we present this model in Section 11.3.4 . To make a probabilistic retrieval strategy precise, we need to estimate how terms in documents contribute to relevance, specifically, we wish to know how term frequency, document frequency, document length, and other statistics that we can compute influence judgments about document relevance, and how they can be reasonably combined to estimate the probability of document relevance. We then order documents by decreasing estimated probability of relevance. We assume here that the relevance of each document is independent of the relevance of other documents. As we noted in Section 8.5.1 (page ), this is incorrect: the assumption is especially harmful in practice if it allows a system to return duplicate or near duplicate documents. Under the BIM, we model the probability that a document is relevant via the probability in terms of term incidence vectors . Then, using Bayes rule, we have: (63) (64)            (65)    Subsections Deriving a ranking function for query terms Probability estimates in theory Probability estimates in practice Probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback
iir_11_3_1	Deriving a ranking function for query terms Given a query , we wish to order returned documents by descending . Under the BIM, this is modeled as ordering by . Rather than estimating this probability directly, because we are interested only in the ranking of documents, we work with some other quantities which are easier to compute and which give the same ordering of documents. In particular, we can rank documents by their odds of relevance (as the odds of relevance is monotonic with the probability of relevance). This makes things easier, because we can ignore the common denominator in Rxq-bayes, giving: (66)  The left term in the rightmost expression of Equation 66 is a constant for a given query. Since we are only ranking documents, there is thus no need for us to estimate it. The right-hand term does, however, require estimation, and this initially appears to be difficult: How can we accurately estimate the probability of an entire term incidence vector occurring? It is at this point that we make the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption that the presence or absence of a word in a document is independent of the presence or absence of any other word (given the query): (67)   (68)    (69)       Let us make an additional simplifying assumption that terms not occurring in the query are equally likely to occur in relevant and nonrelevant documents: that is, if then . (This assumption can be changed, as when doing relevance feedback in Section 11.3.4 .) Then we need only consider terms in the products that appear in the query, and so, (70)  We can manipulate this expression by including the query terms found in the document into the right product, but simultaneously dividing through by them in the left product, so the value is unchanged. Then we have: (71)    Retrieval Status Value  (72)  So everything comes down to computing the . Define : (73)      odds ratio   7.1
iir_11_3_2	Probability estimates in theory For each term , what would these numbers look like for the whole collection? odds-ratio-ct-contingency gives a contingency table of counts of documents in the collection, where is the number of documents that contain term : Using this, and and (74)   add   (75)  Adding in this way is a simple form of smoothing. For trials with categorical outcomes (such as noting the presence or absence of a term), one way to estimate the probability of an event from data is simply to count the number of times an event occurred divided by the total number of trials. This is referred to as the relative frequency of the event. Estimating the probability as the relative frequency is the maximum likelihood estimate (or MLE ), because this value makes the observed data maximally likely. However, if we simply use the MLE, then the probability given to events we happened to see is usually too high, whereas other events may be completely unseen and giving them as a probability estimate their relative frequency of 0 is both an underestimate, and normally breaks our models, since anything multiplied by 0 is 0. Simultaneously decreasing the estimated probability of seen events and increasing the probability of unseen events is referred to as smoothing . One simple way of smoothing is to add a number to each of the observed counts. These pseudocounts correspond to the use of a uniform distribution over the vocabulary as a Bayesian prior , following Equation 59. We initially assume a uniform distribution over events, where the size of denotes the strength of our belief in uniformity, and we then update the probability based on observed events. Since our belief in uniformity is weak, we use . This is a form of maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimation, where we choose the most likely point value for probabilities based on the prior and the observed evidence, following Equation 59. We will further discuss methods of smoothing estimated counts to give probability models in Section 12.2.2 (page ); the simple method of adding to each observed count will do for now.
iir_11_3_3	Probability estimates in practice    (76)   idf 6.2.1 The approximation technique in Equation 76 cannot easily be extended to relevant documents. The quantity can be estimated in various ways: We can use the frequency of term occurrence in known relevant documents (if we know some). This is the basis of probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback weighting in a feedback loop, discussed in the next subsection. Croft and Harper (1979) proposed using a constant in their combination match model. For instance, we might assume that is constant over all terms in the query and that . This means that each term has even odds of appearing in a relevant document, and so the and factors cancel out in the expression for . Such an estimate is weak, but doesn't disagree violently with our hopes for the search terms appearing in many but not all relevant documents. Combining this method with our earlier approximation for , the document ranking is determined simply by which query terms occur in documents scaled by their idf weighting. For short documents (titles or abstracts) in situations in which iterative searching is undesirable, using this weighting term alone can be quite satisfactory, although in many other circumstances we would like to do better. Greiff (1998) argues that the constant estimate of in the Croft and Harper (1979) model is theoretically problematic and not observed empirically: as might be expected, is shown to rise with . Based on his data analysis, a plausible proposal would be to use the estimate . Iterative methods of estimation, which combine some of the above ideas, are discussed in the next subsection.
iir_11_3_4	Probabilistic approaches to relevance feedback We can use (pseudo-)relevance feedback, perhaps in an iterative process of estimation, to get a more accurate estimate of . The probabilistic approach to relevance feedback works as follows: Guess initial estimates of and . This can be done using the probability estimates of the previous section. For instance, we can assume that is constant over all in the query, in particular, perhaps taking . Use the current estimates of and to determine a best guess at the set of relevant documents . Use this model to retrieve a set of candidate relevant documents, which we present to the user. We interact with the user to refine the model of . We do this by learning from the user relevance judgments for some subset of documents . Based on relevance judgments, is partitioned into two subsets: and , which is disjoint from . We reestimate and on the basis of known relevant and nonrelevant documents. If the sets and are large enough, we may be able to estimate these quantities directly from these documents as maximum likelihood estimates: (77) (where is the set of documents in containing ). In practice, we usually need to smooth these estimates. We can do this by adding to both the count and to the number of relevant documents not containing the term, giving: (78) However, the set of documents judged by the user () is usually very small, and so the resulting statistical estimate is quite unreliable (noisy), even if the estimate is smoothed. So it is often better to combine the new information with the original guess in a process of Bayesian updating . In this case we have: (79) Here is the estimate for in an iterative updating process and is used as a Bayesian prior in the next iteration with a weighting of . Relating this equation back to Equation 59 requires a bit more probability theory than we have presented here (we need to use a beta distribution prior, conjugate to the Bernoulli random variable ). But the form of the resulting equation is quite straightforward: rather than uniformly distributing pseudocounts, we now distribute a total of pseudocounts according to the previous estimate, which acts as the prior distribution. In the absence of other evidence (and assuming that the user is perhaps indicating roughly 5 relevant or nonrelevant documents) then a value of around is perhaps appropriate. That is, the prior is strongly weighted so that the estimate does not change too much from the evidence provided by a very small number of documents. Repeat the above process from step 2, generating a succession of approximations to and hence , until the user is satisfied. It is also straightforward to derive a pseudo-relevance feedback version of this algorithm, where we simply pretend that . More briefly: Assume initial estimates for and as above. Determine a guess for the size of the relevant document set. If unsure, a conservative (too small) guess is likely to be best. This motivates use of a fixed size set of highest ranked documents. Improve our guesses for and . We choose from the methods of and 79 for re-estimating , except now based on the set instead of . If we let be the subset of documents in containing and use add smoothing , we get: (80) and if we assume that documents that are not retrieved are nonrelevant then we can update our estimates as: (81) Go to step 2 until the ranking of the returned results converges. Once we have a real estimate for then the weights used in the value look almost like a tf-idf value. For instance, using Equation 73, Equation 76, and Equation 80, we have: (82)     (83)  adding Exercises. Work through the derivation of Equation 74 from and 3()I . What are the differences between standard vector space tf-idf weighting and the BIM probabilistic retrieval model (in the case where no document relevance information is available)? Let be a random variable indicating whether the term appears in a document. Suppose we have relevant documents in the document collection and that in of the documents. Take the observed data to be just these observations of for each document in . Show that the MLE for the parameter , that is, the value for which maximizes the probability of the observed data, is .

iir_11_4_1	An appraisal of probabilistic models Probabilistic methods are one of the oldest formal models in IR. Already in the 1970s they were held out as an opportunity to place IR on a firmer theoretical footing, and with the resurgence of probabilistic methods in computational linguistics in the 1990s, that hope has returned, and probabilistic methods are again one of the currently hottest topics in IR. Traditionally, probabilistic IR has had neat ideas but the methods have never won on performance. Getting reasonable approximations of the needed probabilities for a probabilistic IR model is possible, but it requires some major assumptions. In the BIM these are: a Boolean representation of documents/queries/relevance term independence terms not in the query don't affect the outcome document relevance values are independent Things started to change in the 1990s when the BM25 weighting scheme, which we discuss in the next section, showed very good performance, and started to be adopted as a term weighting scheme by many groups. The difference between ``vector space'' and ``probabilistic'' IR systems is not that great: in either case, you build an information retrieval scheme in the exact same way that we discussed in Chapter 7 . For a probabilistic IR system, it's just that, at the end, you score queries not by cosine similarity and tf-idf in a vector space, but by a slightly different formula motivated by probability theory. Indeed, sometimes people have changed an existing vector-space IR system into an effectively probabilistic system simply by adopted term weighting formulas from probabilistic models. In this section, we briefly present three extensions of the traditional probabilistic model, and in the next chapter, we look at the somewhat different probabilistic language modeling approach to IR.
iir_11_4_2	Tree-structured dependencies between terms   Some of the assumptions of the BIM can be removed. For example, we can remove the assumption that terms are independent. This assumption is very far from true in practice. A case that particularly violates this assumption is term pairs like Hong and Kong, which are strongly dependent. But dependencies can occur in various complex configurations, such as between the set of terms New, York, England, City, Stock, Exchange, and University. van Rijsbergen (1979) proposed a simple, plausible model which allowed a tree structure of term dependencies, as in Figure 11.1 . In this model each term can be directly dependent on only one other term, giving a tree structure of dependencies. When it was invented in the 1970s, estimation problems held back the practical success of this model, but the idea was reinvented as the Tree Augmented Naive Bayes model by Friedman and Goldszmidt (1996), who used it with some success on various machine learning data sets.
iir_11_4_3	Okapi BM25: a non-binary model The BIM was originally designed for short catalog records and abstracts of fairly consistent length, and it works reasonably in these contexts, but for modern full-text search collections, it seems clear that a model should pay attention to term frequency and document length, as in Chapter 6 . The BM25 weighting scheme , often called Okapi weighting , after the system in which it was first implemented, was developed as a way of building a probabilistic model sensitive to these quantities while not introducing too many additional parameters into the model (Spärck Jones et al., 2000). We will not develop the full theory behind the model here, but just present a series of forms that build up to the standard form now used for document scoring. The simplest score for document is just idf weighting of the query terms present, as in Equation 76: (84)   idf 75    (85)  We can improve on Equation 84 by factoring in the frequency of each term and document length: (86)               If the query is long, then we might also use similar weighting for query terms. This is appropriate if the queries are paragraph long information needs, but unnecessary for short queries. (87)       8.1    If we have relevance judgments available, then we can use the full form of smoothed-rf in place of the approximation introduced in prob-idf: (88)     (89)      11.3.4 Rather than just providing a term weighting method for terms in a user's query, relevance feedback can also involve augmenting the query (automatically or with manual review) with some (say, 10-20) of the top terms in the known-relevant documents as ordered by the relevance factor from Equation 75, and the above formula can then be used with such an augmented query vector . The BM25 term weighting formulas have been used quite widely and quite successfully across a range of collections and search tasks. Especially in the TREC evaluations, they performed well and were widely adopted by many groups. See Spärck Jones et al. (2000) for extensive motivation and discussion of experimental results.
iir_11_4_4	Bayesian network approaches to IR Turtle and Croft (1989;1991) introduced into information retrieval the use of Bayesian networks (Jensen and Jensen, 2001), a form of probabilistic graphical model. We skip the details because fully introducing the formalism of Bayesian networks would require much too much space, but conceptually, Bayesian networks use directed graphs to show probabilistic dependencies between variables, as in Figure 11.1 , and have led to the development of sophisticated algorithms for propagating influence so as to allow learning and inference with arbitrary knowledge within arbitrary directed acyclic graphs. Turtle and Croft used a sophisticated network to better model the complex dependencies between a document and a user's information need. The model decomposes into two parts: a document collection network and a query network. The document collection network is large, but can be precomputed: it maps from documents to terms to concepts. The concepts are a thesaurus-based expansion of the terms appearing in the document. The query network is relatively small but a new network needs to be built each time a query comes in, and then attached to the document network. The query network maps from query terms, to query subexpressions (built using probabilistic or ``noisy'' versions of AND and OR operators), to the user's information need. The result is a flexible probabilistic network which can generalize various simpler Boolean and probabilistic models. Indeed, this is the primary case of a statistical ranked retrieval model that naturally supports structured query operators. The system allowed efficient large-scale retrieval, and was the basis of the InQuery text retrieval system, built at the University of Massachusetts. This system performed very well in TREC evaluations and for a time was sold commercially. On the other hand, the model still used various approximations and independence assumptions to make parameter estimation and computation possible. There has not been much follow-on work along these lines, but we would note that this model was actually built very early on in the modern era of using Bayesian networks, and there have been many subsequent developments in the theory, and the time is perhaps right for a new generation of Bayesian network-based information retrieval systems.

An introduction to Bayesian utility theory can be found in (Ripley, 1996). The probabilistic approach to IR originated in the UK in the 1950s. The first major presentation of a probabilistic model is Maron and Kuhns (1960). Robertson and Jones (1976) introduce the main foundations of the BIM and van Rijsbergen (1979) presents in detail the classic BIM probabilistic model. The idea of the PRP is variously attributed to S. E. Robertson, M. E. Maron and W. S. Cooper (the term ``Probabilistic Ordering Principle'' is used in Robertson and Jones (1976), but PRP dominates in later work). Fuhr (1992) is a more recent presentation of probabilistic IR, which includes coverage of other approaches such as probabilistic logics and Bayesian networks. Crestani et al. (1998) is another survey. Spärck Jones et al. (2000) is the definitive presentation of probabilistic IR experiments by the ``London school'', and Robertson (2005) presents a retrospective on the group's participation in TREC evaluations, including detailed discussion of the Okapi BM25 scoring function and its development. Robertson et al. (2004) extend BM25 to the case of multiple weighted fields. The open-source Indri search engine, which is distributed with the Lemur toolkit (http://www.lemurproject.org/) merges ideas from Bayesian inference networks and statistical language modeling approaches (see Chapter 12 ), in particular preserving the former's support for structured query operators.
iir_12	Language models for information retrieval A common suggestion to users for coming up with good queries is to think of words that would likely appear in a relevant document, and to use those words as the query. The language modeling approach to IR directly models that idea: a document is a good match to a query if the document model is likely to generate the query, which will in turn happen if the document contains the query words often. This approach thus provides a different realization of some of the basic ideas for document ranking which we saw in Section 6.2 (page ). Instead of overtly modeling the probability of relevance of a document to a query , as in the traditional probabilistic approach to IR (Chapter 11 ), the basic language modeling approach instead builds a probabilistic language model from each document , and ranks documents based on the probability of the model generating the query: . In this chapter, we first introduce the concept of language models (Section 12.1 ) and then describe the basic and most commonly used language modeling approach to IR, the Query Likelihood Model (Section 12.2 ). After some comparisons between the language modeling approach and other approaches to IR (Section 12.3 ), we finish by briefly describing various extensions to the language modeling approach (Section 12.4 ).

iir_12_1_1	Finite automata and language models   What do we mean by a document model generating a query? A traditional generative model of a language, of the kind familiar from formal language theory, can be used either to recognize or to generate strings. For example, the finite automaton shown in Figure 12.1 can generate strings that include the examples shown. The full set of strings that can be generated is called the language of the automaton.   If instead each node has a probability distribution over generating different terms, we have a language model. The notion of a language model is inherently probabilistic. A language model is a function that puts a probability measure over strings drawn from some vocabulary. That is, for a language model over an alphabet : (90)   12.2 Worked example. To find the probability of a word sequence, we just multiply the probabilities which the model gives to each word in the sequence, together with the probability of continuing or stopping after producing each word. For example, (91)     (92)   (93)   frog 90 STOP   likelihood ratio  12.1.3 End worked example.  Figure 12.3: Partial specification of two unigram language models. Worked example. Suppose, now, that we have two language models and , shown partially in Figure 12.3 . Each gives a probability estimate to a sequence of terms, as already illustrated in m1probability. The language model that gives the higher probability to the sequence of terms is more likely to have generated the term sequence. This time, we will omit STOP probabilities from our calculations. For the sequence shown, we get: and we see that . We present the formulas here in terms of products of probabilities, but, as is common in probabilistic applications, in practice it is usually best to work with sums of log probabilities (cf. page 13.2 ). End worked example.
iir_12_1_2	Types of language models How do we build probabilities over sequences of terms? We can always use the chain rule from Equation 56 to decompose the probability of a sequence of events into the probability of each successive event conditioned on earlier events: (94)   unigram language model  (95)   bigram language models  (96)   speech recognition  spelling correction  machine translation  sparseness 13.2  bias-variance tradeoff 11 11.4.2
iir_12_1_3	Multinomial distributions over words Under the unigram language model the order of words is irrelevant, and so such models are often called ``bag of words'' models, as discussed in Chapter 6 (page 6.2 ). Even though there is no conditioning on preceding context, this model nevertheless still gives the probability of a particular ordering of terms. However, any other ordering of this bag of terms will have the same probability. So, really, we have a multinomial distribution over words. So long as we stick to unigram models, the language model name and motivation could be viewed as historical rather than necessary. We could instead just refer to the model as a multinomial model. From this perspective, the equations presented above do not present the multinomial probability of a bag of words, since they do not sum over all possible orderings of those words, as is done by the multinomial coefficient (the first term on the right-hand side) in the standard presentation of a multinomial model: (97)     STOP 13.2  The fundamental problem in designing language models is that we do not know what exactly we should use as the model . However, we do generally have a sample of text that is representative of that model. This problem makes a lot of sense in the original, primary uses of language models. For example, in speech recognition, we have a training sample of (spoken) text. But we have to expect that, in the future, users will use different words and in different sequences, which we have never observed before, and so the model has to generalize beyond the observed data to allow unknown words and sequences. This interpretation is not so clear in the IR case, where a document is finite and usually fixed. The strategy we adopt in IR is as follows. We pretend that the document is only a representative sample of text drawn from a model distribution, treating it like a fine-grained topic. We then estimate a language model from this sample, and use that model to calculate the probability of observing any word sequence, and, finally, we rank documents according to their probability of generating the query. Exercises. Including stop probabilities in the calculation, what will the sum of the probability estimates of all strings in the language of length 1 be? Assume that you generate a word and then decide whether to stop or not (i.e., the null string is not part of the language). If the stop probability is omitted from calculations, what will the sum of the scores assigned to strings in the language of length 1 be? What is the likelihood ratio of the document according to and in m1m2compare? No explicit STOP probability appeared in m1m2compare. Assuming that the STOP probability of each model is 0.1, does this change the likelihood ratio of a document according to the two models? How might a language model be used in a spelling correction system? In particular, consider the case of context-sensitive spelling correction, and correcting incorrect usages of words, such as their in Are you their? (See Section 3.5 (page ) for pointers to some literature on this topic.)
iir_12_2_1	Using query likelihood language models in IR Language modeling is a quite general formal approach to IR, with many variant realizations. The original and basic method for using language models in IR is the query likelihood model . In it, we construct from each document in the collection a language model . Our goal is to rank documents by , where the probability of a document is interpreted as the likelihood that it is relevant to the query. Using Bayes rule (as introduced in probirsec), we have: (98)        The most common way to do this is using the multinomial unigram language model, which is equivalent to a multinomial Naive Bayes model (page 13.3 ), where the documents are the classes, each treated in the estimation as a separate ``language''. Under this model, we have that: (99)    For retrieval based on a language model (henceforth LM ), we treat the generation of queries as a random process. The approach is to Infer a LM for each document. Estimate , the probability of generating the query according to each of these document models. Rank the documents according to these probabilities.
iir_12_2_2	Estimating the query generation probability In this section we describe how to estimate . The probability of producing the query given the LM of document using maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) and the unigram assumption is: (100)          11.3.2  The classic problem with using language models is one of estimation (the symbol on the P's is used above to stress that the model is estimated): terms appear very sparsely in documents. In particular, some words will not have appeared in the document at all, but are possible words for the information need, which the user may have used in the query. If we estimate for a term missing from a document , then we get a strict conjunctive semantics: documents will only give a query non-zero probability if all of the query terms appear in the document. Zero probabilities are clearly a problem in other uses of language models, such as when predicting the next word in a speech recognition application, because many words will be sparsely represented in the training data. It may seem rather less clear whether this is problematic in an IR application. This could be thought of as a human-computer interface issue: vector space systems have generally preferred more lenient matching, though recent web search developments have tended more in the direction of doing searches with such conjunctive semantics. Regardless of the approach here, there is a more general problem of estimation: occurring words are also badly estimated; in particular, the probability of words occurring once in the document is normally overestimated, since their one occurrence was partly by chance. The answer to this (as we saw in probtheory) is smoothing. But as people have come to understand the LM approach better, it has become apparent that the role of smoothing in this model is not only to avoid zero probabilities. The smoothing of terms actually implements major parts of the term weighting component (Exercise 12.2.3 ). It is not just that an unsmoothed model has conjunctive semantics; an unsmoothed model works badly because it lacks parts of the term weighting component. Thus, we need to smooth probabilities in our document language models: to discount non-zero probabilities and to give some probability mass to unseen words. There's a wide space of approaches to smoothing probability distributions to deal with this problem. In Section 11.3.2 (page ), we already discussed adding a number (1, 1/2, or a small ) to the observed counts and renormalizing to give a probability distribution.In this section we will mention a couple of other smoothing methods, which involve combining observed counts with a more general reference probability distribution. The general approach is that a non-occurring term should be possible in a query, but its probability should be somewhat close to but no more likely than would be expected by chance from the whole collection. That is, if then (101)     (102)     linear interpolation   An alternative is to use a language model built from the whole collection as a prior distribution in a Bayesian updating process (rather than a uniform distribution, as we saw in Section 11.3.2 ). We then get the following equation: (103)  Both of these smoothing methods have been shown to perform well in IR experiments; we will stick with the linear interpolation smoothing method for the rest of this section. While different in detail, they are both conceptually similar: in both cases the probability estimate for a word present in the document combines a discounted MLE and a fraction of the estimate of its prevalence in the whole collection, while for words not present in a document, the estimate is just a fraction of the estimate of the prevalence of the word in the whole collection. The role of smoothing in LMs for IR is not simply or principally to avoid estimation problems. This was not clear when the models were first proposed, but it is now understood that smoothing is essential to the good properties of the models. The reason for this is explored in Exercise 12.2.3 . The extent of smoothing in these two models is controlled by the and parameters: a small value of or a large value of means more smoothing. This parameter can be tuned to optimize performance using a line search (or, for the linear interpolation model, by other methods, such as the expectation maximimization algorithm; see modelclustering). The value need not be a constant. One approach is to make the value a function of the query size. This is useful because a small amount of smoothing (a ``conjunctive-like'' search) is more suitable for short queries, while a lot of smoothing is more suitable for long queries. To summarize, the retrieval ranking for a query under the basic LM for IR we have been considering is given by: (104)   Worked example. Suppose the document collection contains two documents: : Xyzzy reports a profit but revenue is down : Quorus narrows quarter loss but revenue decreases further  Suppose the query is revenue down. Then: (105)   (106) (107)   (108)    End worked example.
iir_12_2_3	Ponte and Croft's Experiments   Ponte and Croft (1998) present the first experiments on the language modeling approach to information retrieval. Their basic approach is the model that we have presented until now. However, we have presented an approach where the language model is a mixture of two multinomials, much as in (Miller et al., 1999, Hiemstra, 2000) rather than Ponte and Croft's multivariate Bernoulli model. The use of multinomials has been standard in most subsequent work in the LM approach and experimental results in IR, as well as evidence from text classification which we consider in Section 13.3 (page ), suggests that it is superior. Ponte and Croft argued strongly for the effectiveness of the term weights that come from the language modeling approach over traditional tf-idf weights. We present a subset of their results in Figure 12.4 where they compare tf-idf to language modeling by evaluating TREC topics 202-250 over TREC disks 2 and 3. The queries are sentence-length natural language queries. The language modeling approach yields significantly better results than their baseline tf-idf based term weighting approach. And indeed the gains shown here have been extended in subsequent work. Exercises. Consider making a language model from the following training text: the martian has landed on the latin pop sensation ricky martin Under a MLE-estimated unigram probability model, what are and ? Under a MLE-estimated bigram model, what are and ? Suppose we have a collection that consists of the 4 documents given in the below table. docID Document text 1 click go the shears boys click click click 2 click click 3 metal here 4 metal shears click here Build a query likelihood language model for this document collection. Assume a mixture model between the documents and the collection, with both weighted at 0.5. Maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is used to estimate both as unigram models. Work out the model probabilities of the queries click, shears, and hence click shears for each document, and use those probabilities to rank the documents returned by each query. Fill in these probabilities in the below table: Query Doc 1 Doc 2 Doc 3 Doc 4 click         shears         click shears         What is the final ranking of the documents for the query click shears? Using the calculations in Exercise 12.2.3 as inspiration or as examples where appropriate, write one sentence each describing the treatment that the model in Equation 102 gives to each of the following quantities. Include whether it is present in the model or not and whether the effect is raw or scaled. Term frequency in a document Collection frequency of a term Document frequency of a term Length normalization of a term In the mixture model approach to the query likelihood model (Equation 104), the probability estimate of a term is based on the term frequency of a word in a document, and the collection frequency of the word. Doing this certainly guarantees that each term of a query (in the vocabulary) has a non-zero chance of being generated by each document. But it has a more subtle but important effect of implementing a form of term weighting, related to what we saw in Chapter 6 . Explain how this works. In particular, include in your answer a concrete numeric example showing this term weighting at work.
iir_12_3	Language modeling versus other approaches in IR The language modeling approach provides a novel way of looking at the problem of text retrieval, which links it with a lot of recent work in speech and language processing. As Ponte and Croft (1998) emphasize, the language modeling approach to IR provides a different approach to scoring matches between queries and documents, and the hope is that the probabilistic language modeling foundation improves the weights that are used, and hence the performance of the model. The major issue is estimation of the document model, such as choices of how to smooth it effectively. The model has achieved very good retrieval results. Compared to other probabilistic approaches, such as the BIM from Chapter 11 , the main difference initially appears to be that the LM approach does away with explicitly modeling relevance (whereas this is the central variable evaluated in the BIM approach). But this may not be the correct way to think about things, as some of the papers in Section 12.5 further discuss. The LM approach assumes that documents and expressions of information needs are objects of the same type, and assesses their match by importing the tools and methods of language modeling from speech and natural language processing. The resulting model is mathematically precise, conceptually simple, computationally tractable, and intuitively appealing. This seems similar to the situation with XML retrieval (Chapter 10 ): there the approaches that assume queries and documents are objects of the same type are also among the most successful. On the other hand, like all IR models, you can also raise objections to the model. The assumption of equivalence between document and information need representation is unrealistic. Current LM approaches use very simple models of language, usually unigram models. Without an explicit notion of relevance, relevance feedback is difficult to integrate into the model, as are user preferences. It also seems necessary to move beyond a unigram model to accommodate notions of phrase or passage matching or Boolean retrieval operators. Subsequent work in the LM approach has looked at addressing some of these concerns, including putting relevance back into the model and allowing a language mismatch between the query language and the document language. The model has significant relations to traditional tf-idf models. Term frequency is directly represented in tf-idf models, and much recent work has recognized the importance of document length normalization. The effect of doing a mixture of document generation probability with collection generation probability is a little like idf: terms rare in the general collection but common in some documents will have a greater influence on the ranking of documents. In most concrete realizations, the models share treating terms as if they were independent. On the other hand, the intuitions are probabilistic rather than geometric, the mathematical models are more principled rather than heuristic, and the details of how statistics like term frequency and document length are used differ. If you are concerned mainly with performance numbers, recent work has shown the LM approach to be very effective in retrieval experiments, beating tf-idf and BM25 weights. Nevertheless, there is perhaps still insufficient evidence that its performance so greatly exceeds that of a well-tuned traditional vector space retrieval system as to justify changing an existing implementation.
iir_12_4	Extended language modeling approaches In this section we briefly mention some of the work that extends the basic language modeling approach. There are other ways to think of using the language modeling idea in IR settings, and many of them have been tried in subsequent work. Rather than looking at the probability of a document language model generating the query, you can look at the probability of a query language model generating the document. The main reason that doing things in this direction and creating a document likelihood model is less appealing is that there is much less text available to estimate a language model based on the query text, and so the model will be worse estimated, and will have to depend more on being smoothed with some other language model. On the other hand, it is easy to see how to incorporate relevance feedback into such a model: you can expand the query with terms taken from relevant documents in the usual way and hence update the language model (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001a). Indeed, with appropriate modeling choices, this approach leads to the BIM model of Chapter 11 . The relevance model of Lavrenko and Croft (2001) is an instance of a document likelihood model, which incorporates pseudo-relevance feedback into a language modeling approach. It achieves very strong empirical results.  Figure 12.5: Three ways of developing the language modeling approach: (a) query likelihood, (b) document likelihood, and (c) model comparison. Rather than directly generating in either direction, we can make a language model from both the document and query, and then ask how different these two language models are from each other. Lafferty and Zhai (2001) lay out these three ways of thinking about the problem, which we show in Figure 12.5 , and develop a general risk minimization approach for document retrieval. For instance, one way to model the risk of returning a document as relevant to a query is to use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their respective language models: (109)    Manning and Schütze, 1999 Cover and Thomas, 1991 Lafferty and Zhai (2001) Kraaij and Spitters (2003)  Basic LMs do not address issues of alternate expression, that is, synonymy, or any deviation in use of language between queries and documents. Berger and Lafferty (1999) introduce translation models to bridge this query-document gap. A translation model lets you generate query words not in a document by translation to alternate terms with similar meaning. This also provides a basis for performing cross-language IR. We assume that the translation model can be represented by a conditional probability distribution between vocabulary terms. The form of the translation query generation model is then: (110)    Building extended LM approaches remains an active area of research. In general, translation models, relevance feedback models, and model comparison approaches have all been demonstrated to improve performance over the basic query likelihood LM.
iir_12_5	References and further reading For more details on the basic concepts of probabilistic language models and techniques for smoothing, see either Manning and Schütze (1999, Chapter 6) or Jurafsky and Martin (2008, Chapter 4). The important initial papers that originated the language modeling approach to IR are: (Berger and Lafferty, 1999, Ponte and Croft, 1998, Miller et al., 1999, Hiemstra, 1998). Other relevant papers can be found in the next several years of SIGIR proceedings. (Croft and Lafferty, 2003) contains a collection of papers from a workshop on language modeling approaches and Hiemstra and Kraaij (2005) review one prominent thread of work on using language modeling approaches for TREC tasks. Zhai and Lafferty (2001b) clarify the role of smoothing in LMs for IR and present detailed empirical comparisons of different smoothing methods. Zaragoza et al. (2003) advocate using full Bayesian predictive distributions rather than MAP point estimates, but while they outperform Bayesian smoothing, they fail to outperform a linear interpolation. Zhai and Lafferty (2002) argue that a two-stage smoothing model with first Bayesian smoothing followed by linear interpolation gives a good model of the task, and performs better and more stably than a single form of smoothing. A nice feature of the LM approach is that it provides a convenient and principled way to put various kinds of prior information into the model; Kraaij et al. (2002) demonstrate this by showing the value of link information as a prior in improving web entry page retrieval performance. As briefly discussed in Chapter 16 (page 16.1 ), Liu and Croft (2004) show some gains by smoothing a document LM with estimates from a cluster of similar documents; Tao et al. (2006) report larger gains by doing document-similarity based smoothing. Hiemstra and Kraaij (2005) present TREC results showing a LM approach beating use of BM25 weights. Recent work has achieved some gains by going beyond the unigram model, providing the higher order models are smoothed with lower order models (Cao et al., 2005, Gao et al., 2004), though the gains to date remain modest. Spärck Jones (2004) presents a critical viewpoint on the rationale for the language modeling approach, but Lafferty and Zhai (2003) argue that a unified account can be given of the probabilistic semantics underlying both the language modeling approach presented in this chapter and the classical probabilistic information retrieval approach of Chapter 11 . The Lemur Toolkit (http://www.lemurproject.org/) provides a flexible open source framework for investigating language modeling approaches to IR.
iir_13	Text classification and Naive Bayes Thus far, this book has mainly discussed the process of ad hoc retrieval , where users have transient information needs that they try to address by posing one or more queries to a search engine. However, many users have ongoing information needs. For example, you might need to track developments in multicore computer chips. One way of doing this is to issue the query multicore and computer and chip against an index of recent newswire articles each morning. In this and the following two chapters we examine the question: How can this repetitive task be automated? To this end, many systems support standing queries . A standing query is like any other query except that it is periodically executed on a collection to which new documents are incrementally added over time. If your standing query is just multicore and computer and chip, you will tend to miss many relevant new articles which use other terms such as multicore processors. To achieve good recall, standing queries thus have to be refined over time and can gradually become quite complex. In this example, using a Boolean search engine with stemming, you might end up with a query like (multicore or multi-core) and (chip or processor or microprocessor). To capture the generality and scope of the problem space to which standing queries belong, we now introduce the general notion of a classification problem. Given a set of classes, we seek to determine which class(es) a given object belongs to. In the example, the standing query serves to divide new newswire articles into the two classes: documents about multicore computer chips and documents not about multicore computer chips. We refer to this as two-class classification. Classification using standing queries is also called routing or filtering and will be discussed further in Section 15.3.1 (page ). A class need not be as narrowly focused as the standing query multicore computer chips. Often, a class is a more general subject area like China or coffee. Such more general classes are usually referred to as topics , and the classification task is then called text classification , text categorization , topic classification , or topic spotting . An example for China appears in Figure 13.1 . Standing queries and topics differ in their degree of specificity, but the methods for solving routing, filtering, and text classification are essentially the same. We therefore include routing and filtering under the rubric of text classification in this and the following chapters. The notion of classification is very general and has many applications within and beyond information retrieval (IR). For instance, in computer vision, a classifier may be used to divide images into classes such as landscape, portrait, and neither. We focus here on examples from information retrieval such as:  Several of the preprocessing steps necessary for indexing as discussed in Chapter 2 : detecting a document's encoding (ASCII, Unicode UTF-8 etc; page 2.1.1 ); word segmentation (Is the white space between two letters a word boundary or not? page 24 ) ; truecasing (page 2.2.3 ); and identifying the language of a document (page 2.5 ). The automatic detection of spam pages (which then are not included in the search engine index). The automatic detection of sexually explicit content (which is included in search results only if the user turns an option such as SafeSearch off). Sentiment detection or the automatic classification of a movie or product review as positive or negative. An example application is a user searching for negative reviews before buying a camera to make sure it has no undesirable features or quality problems. Personal email sorting . A user may have folders like talk announcements, electronic bills, email from family and friends, and so on, and may want a classifier to classify each incoming email and automatically move it to the appropriate folder. It is easier to find messages in sorted folders than in a very large inbox. The most common case of this application is a spam folder that holds all suspected spam messages. Topic-specific or vertical search. Vertical search engines restrict searches to a particular topic. For example, the query computer science on a vertical search engine for the topic China will return a list of Chinese computer science departments with higher precision and recall than the query computer science China on a general purpose search engine. This is because the vertical search engine does not include web pages in its index that contain the term china in a different sense (e.g., referring to a hard white ceramic), but does include relevant pages even if they do not explicitly mention the term China. Finally, the ranking function in ad hoc information retrieval can also be based on a document classifier as we will explain in Section 15.4 (page ). This list shows the general importance of classification in IR. Most retrieval systems today contain multiple components that use some form of classifier. The classification task we will use as an example in this book is text classification. A computer is not essential for classification. Many classification tasks have traditionally been solved manually. Books in a library are assigned Library of Congress categories by a librarian. But manual classification is expensive to scale. The multicore computer chips example illustrates one alternative approach: classification by the use of standing queries - which can be thought of as rules - most commonly written by hand. As in our example (multicore or multi-core) and (chip or processor or microprocessor), rules are sometimes equivalent to Boolean expressions. A rule captures a certain combination of keywords that indicates a class. Hand-coded rules have good scaling properties, but creating and maintaining them over time is labor intensive. A technically skilled person (e.g., a domain expert who is good at writing regular expressions) can create rule sets that will rival or exceed the accuracy of the automatically generated classifiers we will discuss shortly; however, it can be hard to find someone with this specialized skill. Apart from manual classification and hand-crafted rules, there is a third approach to text classification, namely, machine learning-based text classification. It is the approach that we focus on in the next several chapters. In machine learning, the set of rules or, more generally, the decision criterion of the text classifier, is learned automatically from training data. This approach is also called statistical text classification if the learning method is statistical. In statistical text classification, we require a number of good example documents (or training documents) for each class. The need for manual classification is not eliminated because the training documents come from a person who has labeled them - where labeling refers to the process of annotating each document with its class. But labeling is arguably an easier task than writing rules. Almost anybody can look at a document and decide whether or not it is related to China. Sometimes such labeling is already implicitly part of an existing workflow. For instance, you may go through the news articles returned by a standing query each morning and give relevance feedback (cf. Chapter 9 ) by moving the relevant articles to a special folder like multicore-processors. We begin this chapter with a general introduction to the text classification problem including a formal definition (Section 13.1 ); we then cover Naive Bayes, a particularly simple and effective classification method (Sections 13.2-13.4). All of the classification algorithms we study represent documents in high-dimensional spaces. To improve the efficiency of these algorithms, it is generally desirable to reduce the dimensionality of these spaces; to this end, a technique known as feature selection is commonly applied in text classification as discussed in Section 13.5 . Section 13.6 covers evaluation of text classification. In the following chapters, Chapters 14 15 , we look at two other families of classification methods, vector space classifiers and support vector machines.

iir_13_1	The text classification problem In text classification, we are given a description of a document, where is the document space ; and a fixed set of classes . Classes are also called categories or labels . Typically, the document space is some type of high-dimensional space, and the classes are human defined for the needs of an application, as in the examples China and documents that talk about multicore computer chips above. We are given a training set of labeled documents , where . For example: (111)  Using a learning method or learning algorithm , we then wish to learn a classifier or classification function that maps documents to classes:  (112)  This type of learning is called supervised learning because a supervisor (the human who defines the classes and labels training documents) serves as a teacher directing the learning process. We denote the supervised learning method by and write . The learning method takes the training set as input and returns the learned classification function . Most names for learning methods are also used for classifiers . We talk about the Naive Bayes (NB) learning method when we say that ``Naive Bayes is robust,'' meaning that it can be applied to many different learning problems and is unlikely to produce classifiers that fail catastrophically. But when we say that ``Naive Bayes had an error rate of 20%,'' we are describing an experiment in which a particular NB classifier (which was produced by the NB learning method) had a 20% error rate in an application. Figure 13.1 shows an example of text classification from the Reuters-RCV1 collection, introduced in Section 4.2 , page 4.2 . There are six classes (UK, China, ..., sports), each with three training documents. We show a few mnemonic words for each document's content. The training set provides some typical examples for each class, so that we can learn the classification function . Once we have learned , we can apply it to the test set (or test data ), for example, the new document first private Chinese airline whose class is unknown. In Figure 13.1 , the classification function assigns the new document to class China, which is the correct assignment. The classes in text classification often have some interesting structure such as the hierarchy in Figure 13.1 . There are two instances each of region categories, industry categories, and subject area categories. A hierarchy can be an important aid in solving a classification problem; see Section 15.3.2 for further discussion. Until then, we will make the assumption in the text classification chapters that the classes form a set with no subset relationships between them.  Figure 13.1: Classes, training set, and test set in text classification . Definition eqn:gammadef stipulates that a document is a member of exactly one class. This is not the most appropriate model for the hierarchy in Figure 13.1 . For instance, a document about the 2008 Olympics should be a member of two classes: the China class and the sports class. This type of classification problem is referred to as an any-of problem and we will return to it in Section 14.5 (page ). For the time being, we only consider one-of problems where a document is a member of exactly one class. Our goal in text classification is high accuracy on test data or new data - for example, the newswire articles that we will encounter tomorrow morning in the multicore chip example. It is easy to achieve high accuracy on the training set (e.g., we can simply memorize the labels). But high accuracy on the training set in general does not mean that the classifier will work well on new data in an application. When we use the training set to learn a classifier for test data, we make the assumption that training data and test data are similar or from the same distribution. We defer a precise definition of this notion to Section 14.6 (page ).
iir_13_2	Naive Bayes text classification  multinomial Naive Bayes  multinomial NB        (113)                   In text classification, our goal is to find the best class for the document. The best class in NB classification is the most likely or maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) class : (114)      In Equation 114, many conditional probabilities are multiplied, one for each position . This can result in a floating point underflow. It is therefore better to perform the computation by adding logarithms of probabilities instead of multiplying probabilities. The class with the highest log probability score is still the most probable; and the logarithm function is monotonic. Hence, the maximization that is actually done in most implementations of NB is:     (115)   Equation 115 has a simple interpretation. Each conditional parameter is a weight that indicates how good an indicator is for . Similarly, the prior is a weight that indicates the relative frequency of . More frequent classes are more likely to be the correct class than infrequent classes. The sum of log prior and term weights is then a measure of how much evidence there is for the document being in the class, and Equation 115 selects the class for which we have the most evidence. We will initially work with this intuitive interpretation of the multinomial NB model and defer a formal derivation to Section 13.4 . How do we estimate the parameters and ? We first try the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE; probtheory), which is simply the relative frequency and corresponds to the most likely value of each parameter given the training data. For the priors this estimate is:     (116)       We estimate the conditional probability as the relative frequency of term in documents belonging to class : (117)      positional independence assumption      The problem with the MLE estimate is that it is zero for a term-class combination that did not occur in the training data. If the term WTO in the training data only occurred in China documents, then the MLE estimates for the other classes, for example UK, will be zero: (118)  113    sparseness  Figure 13.2: Naive Bayes algorithm (multinomial model): Training and testing. To eliminate zeros, we use add-one or Laplace smoothing, which simply adds one to each count (cf. Section 11.3.2 ): (119)   term class 116 We have now introduced all the elements we need for training and applying an NB classifier. The complete algorithm is described in Figure 13.2 .

For the example in Table 13.1 , the multinomial parameters we need to classify the test document are the priors and and the following conditional probabilities:          119 We then get:       End worked example.   Table 13.2: Training and test times for NB.   mode time complexity     training     testing          We use as a notation for here, where is the length of the training collection. This is nonstandard; is not defined for an average. We prefer expressing the time complexity in terms of and because these are the primary statistics used to characterize training collections. The time complexity of APPLYMULTINOMIALNB in Figure 13.2 is . and are the numbers of tokens and types, respectively, in the test document . APPLYMULTINOMIALNB can be modified to be (Exercise 13.6 ). Finally, assuming that the length of test documents is bounded, because for a fixed constant . Table 13.2 summarizes the time complexities. In general, we have , so both training and testing complexity are linear in the time it takes to scan the data. Because we have to look at the data at least once, NB can be said to have optimal time complexity. Its efficiency is one reason why NB is a popular text classification method.   Subsections Relation to multinomial unigram language model

Add-one smoothing is closely related to add- smoothing in Section 11.3.4 (page ). Exercises. Why is in Table 13.2 expected to hold for most text collections ?
iir_13_3	The Bernoulli model There are two different ways we can set up an NB classifier. The model we introduced in the previous section is the multinomial model . It generates one term from the vocabulary in each position of the document, where we assume a generative model that will be discussed in more detail in Section 13.4 (see also page 12.1.1 ). An alternative to the multinomial model is the multivariate Bernoulli model or Bernoulli model . It is equivalent to the binary independence model of Section 11.3 (page ), which generates an indicator for each term of the vocabulary, either indicating presence of the term in the document or indicating absence. Figure 13.3 presents training and testing algorithms for the Bernoulli model. The Bernoulli model has the same time complexity as the multinomial model.   The different generation models imply different estimation strategies and different classification rules. The Bernoulli model estimates as the fraction of documents of class that contain term (Figure 13.3 , TRAINBERNOULLINB, line 8). In contrast, the multinomial model estimates as the fraction of tokens or fraction of positions in documents of class that contain term (Equation 119). When classifying a test document, the Bernoulli model uses binary occurrence information, ignoring the number of occurrences, whereas the multinomial model keeps track of multiple occurrences. As a result, the Bernoulli model typically makes many mistakes when classifying long documents. For example, it may assign an entire book to the class China because of a single occurrence of the term China. The models also differ in how nonoccurring terms are used in classification. They do not affect the classification decision in the multinomial model; but in the Bernoulli model the probability of nonoccurrence is factored in when computing (Figure 13.3 , APPLYBERNOULLINB, Line 7). This is because only the Bernoulli NB model models absence of terms explicitly. Worked example. Applying the Bernoulli model to the example in Table 13.1 , we have the same estimates for the priors as before: , . The conditional probabilities are:      The denominators are and because there are three documents in and one document in and because the constant in Equation 119 is 2 - there are two cases to consider for each term, occurrence and nonoccurrence. The scores of the test document for the two classes are               End worked example.
iir_13_4	Properties of Naive Bayes 11 12   (121)   (122)   (123)   59 59 122  We can interpret Equation 123 as a description of the generative process we assume in Bayesian text classification. To generate a document, we first choose class with probability (top nodes in and 13.5 ). The two models differ in the formalization of the second step, the generation of the document given the class, corresponding to the conditional distribution : (124) (125)        It should now be clearer why we introduced the document space in Equation 112 when we defined the classification problem. A critical step in solving a text classification problem is to choose the document representation. and are two different document representations. In the first case, is the set of all term sequences (or, more precisely, sequences of term tokens). In the second case, is . We cannot use and 125 for text classification directly. For the Bernoulli model, we would have to estimate different parameters, one for each possible combination of values and a class. The number of parameters in the multinomial case has the same order of magnitude.This being a very large quantity, estimating these parameters reliably is infeasible. To reduce the number of parameters, we make the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption . We assume that attribute values are independent of each other given the class: (126) (127)                    Figure 13.4: The multinomial NB model.  Figure 13.5: The Bernoulli NB model. We illustrate the conditional independence assumption in and 13.5 . The class China generates values for each of the five term attributes (multinomial) or six binary attributes (Bernoulli) with a certain probability, independent of the values of the other attributes. The fact that a document in the class China contains the term Taipei does not make it more likely or less likely that it also contains Beijing. In reality, the conditional independence assumption does not hold for text data. Terms are conditionally dependent on each other. But as we will discuss shortly, NB models perform well despite the conditional independence assumption. Even when assuming conditional independence, we still have too many parameters for the multinomial model if we assume a different probability distribution for each position in the document. The position of a term in a document by itself does not carry information about the class. Although there is a difference between China sues France and France sues China, the occurrence of China in position 1 versus position 3 of the document is not useful in NB classification because we look at each term separately. The conditional independence assumption commits us to this way of processing the evidence. Also, if we assumed different term distributions for each position , we would have to estimate a different set of parameters for each . The probability of bean appearing as the first term of a coffee document could be different from it appearing as the second term, and so on. This again causes problems in estimation owing to data sparseness. For these reasons, we make a second independence assumption for the multinomial model, positional independence : The conditional probabilities for a term are the same independent of position in the document. (128)         bag of words 6 6.2 With conditional and positional independence assumptions, we only need to estimate parameters (multinomial model) or (Bernoulli model), one for each term-class combination, rather than a number that is at least exponential in , the size of the vocabulary. The independence assumptions reduce the number of parameters to be estimated by several orders of magnitude. To summarize, we generate a document in the multinomial model (Figure 13.4 ) by first picking a class with where is a random variable taking values from as values. Next we generate term in position with for each of the positions of the document. The all have the same distribution over terms for a given . In the example in Figure 13.4 , we show the generation of , corresponding to the one-sentence document Beijing and Taipei join WTO. For a completely specified document generation model, we would also have to define a distribution over lengths. Without it, the multinomial model is a token generation model rather than a document generation model. We generate a document in the Bernoulli model (Figure 13.5 ) by first picking a class with and then generating a binary indicator for each term of the vocabulary ( ). In the example in Figure 13.5 , we show the generation of , corresponding, again, to the one-sentence document Beijing and Taipei join WTO where we have assumed that and is a stop word.

Naive Bayes is so called because the independence assumptions we have just made are indeed very naive for a model of natural language. The conditional independence assumption states that features are independent of each other given the class. This is hardly ever true for terms in documents. In many cases, the opposite is true. The pairs hong and kong or london and english in Figure 13.7 are examples of highly dependent terms. In addition, the multinomial model makes an assumption of positional independence. The Bernoulli model ignores positions in documents altogether because it only cares about absence or presence. This bag-of-words model discards all information that is communicated by the order of words in natural language sentences. How can NB be a good text classifier when its model of natural language is so oversimplified?   Table 13.4: Correct estimation implies accurate prediction, but accurate prediction does not imply correct estimation.     class selected     true probability 0.6 0.4     (Equation 126) 0.00099 0.00001       NB estimate 0.99 0.01    The answer is that even though the probability estimates of NB are of low quality, its classification decisions are surprisingly good. Consider a document with true probabilities and as shown in Table 13.4 . Assume that contains many terms that are positive indicators for and many terms that are negative indicators for . Thus, when using the multinomial model in Equation 126, will be much larger than (0.00099 vs. 0.00001 in the table). After division by 0.001 to get well-formed probabilities for , we end up with one estimate that is close to 1.0 and one that is close to 0.0. This is common: The winning class in NB classification usually has a much larger probability than the other classes and the estimates diverge very significantly from the true probabilities. But the classification decision is based on which class gets the highest score. It does not matter how accurate the estimates are. Despite the bad estimates, NB estimates a higher probability for and therefore assigns to the correct class in Table 13.4 . Correct estimation implies accurate prediction, but accurate prediction does not imply correct estimation. NB classifiers estimate badly, but often classify well. Even if it is not the method with the highest accuracy for text, NB has many virtues that make it a strong contender for text classification. It excels if there are many equally important features that jointly contribute to the classification decision. It is also somewhat robust to noise features (as defined in the next section) and concept drift - the gradual change over time of the concept underlying a class like US president from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush (see Section 13.7 ). Classifiers like kNN knn can be carefully tuned to idiosyncratic properties of a particular time period. This will then hurt them when documents in the following time period have slightly different properties. The Bernoulli model is particularly robust with respect to concept drift. We will see in Figure 13.8 that it can have decent performance when using fewer than a dozen terms. The most important indicators for a class are less likely to change. Thus, a model that only relies on these features is more likely to maintain a certain level of accuracy in concept drift. NB's main strength is its efficiency: Training and classification can be accomplished with one pass over the data. Because it combines efficiency with good accuracy it is often used as a baseline in text classification research. It is often the method of choice if (i) squeezing out a few extra percentage points of accuracy is not worth the trouble in a text classification application, (ii) a very large amount of training data is available and there is more to be gained from training on a lot of data than using a better classifier on a smaller training set, or (iii) if its robustness to concept drift can be exploited.

The independence assumptions do not hold for text. However, it can be shown that NB is an optimal classifier (in the sense of minimal error rate on new data) for data where the independence assumptions do hold.

iir_13_5	Feature selection Feature selection    noise feature   overfitting  Figure: Basic feature selection algorithm for selecting the best features. We can view feature selection as a method for replacing a complex classifier (using all features) with a simpler one (using a subset of the features). It may appear counterintuitive at first that a seemingly weaker classifier is advantageous in statistical text classification, but when discussing the bias-variance tradeoff in Section 14.6 (page ), we will see that weaker models are often preferable when limited training data are available. The basic feature selection algorithm is shown in Figure 13.6 . For a given class , we compute a utility measure for each term of the vocabulary and select the terms that have the highest values of . All other terms are discarded and not used in classification. We will introduce three different utility measures in this section: mutual information, ; the test, ; and frequency, . Of the two NB models, the Bernoulli model is particularly sensitive to noise features. A Bernoulli NB classifier requires some form of feature selection or else its accuracy will be low. This section mainly addresses feature selection for two-class classification tasks like China versus not-China. Section 13.5.5 briefly discusses optimizations for systems with more than two classes.   Subsections Mutual information Feature selectionChi2 Feature selection Assessing as a feature selection methodAssessing chi-square as a feature selection method Frequency-based feature selection Feature selection for multiple classifiers Comparison of feature selection methods
iir_13_5_1	Mutual information A common feature selection method is to compute as the expected mutual information (MI) of term and class . MI measures how much information the presence/absence of a term contributes to making the correct classification decision on . Formally: (130)        13.4          For MLEs of the probabilities, Equation 130 is equivalent to Equation 131: (131)     (132)                130 131  Worked example. Consider the class poultry and the term export in Reuters-RCV1. The counts of the number of documents with the four possible combinations of indicator values are as follows:   131     End worked example. To select terms for a given class, we use the feature selection algorithm in Figure 13.6 : We compute the utility measure as and select the terms with the largest values. Mutual information measures how much information - in the information-theoretic sense - a term contains about the class. If a term's distribution is the same in the class as it is in the collection as a whole, then . MI reaches its maximum value if the term is a perfect indicator for class membership, that is, if the term is present in a document if and only if the document is in the class.  Figure 13.7: Features with high mutual information scores for six Reuters-RCV1 classes. Figure 13.7 shows terms with high mutual information scores for the six classes in Figure 13.1 . The selected terms (e.g., london, uk, british for the class UK) are of obvious utility for making classification decisions for their respective classes. At the bottom of the list for UK we find terms like peripherals and tonight (not shown in the figure) that are clearly not helpful in deciding whether the document is in the class. As you might expect, keeping the informative terms and eliminating the non-informative ones tends to reduce noise and improve the classifier's accuracy.

A high value of indicates that the hypothesis of independence, which implies that expected and observed counts are similar, is incorrect. In our example, . Based on Table 13.6 , we can reject the hypothesis that poultry and export are independent with only a 0.001 chance of being wrong.Equivalently, we say that the outcome is statistically significant at the 0.001 level. If the two events are dependent, then the occurrence of the term makes the occurrence of the class more likely (or less likely), so it should be helpful as a feature. This is the rationale of feature selection.   Table 13.6: Critical values of the distribution with one degree of freedom. For example, if the two events are independent, then . So for the assumption of independence can be rejected with 99% confidence.   critical value     0.1 2.71     0.05 3.84     0.01 6.63     0.005 7.88     0.001 10.83    An arithmetically simpler way of computing is the following: (137)  133 13.6   Subsections Assessing as a feature selection methodAssessing chi-square as a feature selection method
iir_13_5_3	Frequency-based feature selection  frequency-based feature selection       Frequency-based feature selection selects some frequent terms that have no specific information about the class, for example, the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...), which are frequent across classes in newswire text. When many thousands of features are selected, then frequency-based feature selection often does well. Thus, if somewhat suboptimal accuracy is acceptable, then frequency-based feature selection can be a good alternative to more complex methods. However, Figure 13.8 is a case where frequency-based feature selection performs a lot worse than MI and and should not be used.
iir_13_5_4	Feature selection for multiple classifiers     More commonly, feature selection statistics are first computed separately for each class on the two-class classification task versus and then combined. One combination method computes a single figure of merit for each feature, for example, by averaging the values for feature , and then selects the features with highest figures of merit. Another frequently used combination method selects the top features for each of classifiers and then combines these sets into one global feature set. Classification accuracy often decreases when selecting common features for a system with classifiers as opposed to different sets of size . But even if it does, the gain in efficiency owing to a common document representation may be worth the loss in accuracy .
iir_13_5_5	Comparison of feature selection methods       Despite the differences between the two methods, the classification accuracy of feature sets selected with and MI does not seem to differ systematically. In most text classification problems, there are a few strong indicators and many weak indicators. As long as all strong indicators and a large number of weak indicators are selected, accuracy is expected to be good. Both methods do this. Figure 13.8 compares MI and feature selection for the multinomial model. Peak effectiveness is virtually the same for both methods. reaches this peak later, at 300 features, probably because the rare, but highly significant features it selects initially do not cover all documents in the class. However, features selected later (in the range of 100-300) are of better quality than those selected by MI. All three methods - MI, and frequency based - are greedy methods. They may select features that contribute no incremental information over previously selected features. In Figure 13.7 , kong is selected as the seventh term even though it is highly correlated with previously selected hong and therefore redundant. Although such redundancy can negatively impact accuracy, non-greedy methods (see Section 13.7 for references) are rarely used in text classification due to their computational cost. Exercises.

iir_13_6	Evaluation of text classification Historically, the classic Reuters-21578 collection was the main benchmark for text classification evaluation. This is a collection of 21,578 newswire articles, originally collected and labeled by Carnegie Group, Inc. and Reuters, Ltd. in the course of developing the CONSTRUE text classification system. It is much smaller than and predates the Reuters-RCV1 collection discussed in Chapter 4 (page 4.2 ). The articles are assigned classes from a set of 118 topic categories. A document may be assigned several classes or none, but the commonest case is single assignment (documents with at least one class received an average of 1.24 classes). The standard approach to this any-of problem (Chapter 14 , page 14.5 ) is to learn 118 two-class classifiers, one for each class, where the two-class classifier for class is the classifier for the two classes and its complement .   Table 13.7: The ten largest classes in the Reuters-21578 collection with number of documents in training and test sets.   class # train # test   class # train # test     earn 2877 1087   trade 369 119     acquisitions 1650 179   interest 347 131     money-fx 538 179   ship 197 89     grain 433 149   wheat 212 71     crude 389 189   corn 182 56    For each of these classifiers, we can measure recall, precision, and accuracy. In recent work, people almost invariably use the ModApte split , which includes only documents that were viewed and assessed by a human indexer, and comprises 9,603 training documents and 3,299 test documents. The distribution of documents in classes is very uneven, and some work evaluates systems on only documents in the ten largest classes. They are listed in Table 13.7 . A typical document with topics is shown in Figure 13.9 . In Section 13.1 , we stated as our goal in text classification the minimization of classification error on test data. Classification error is 1.0 minus classification accuracy, the proportion of correct decisions, a measure we introduced in Section 8.3 (page 8.3 ). This measure is appropriate if the percentage of documents in the class is high, perhaps 10% to 20% and higher. But as we discussed in Section 8.3 , accuracy is not a good measure for ``small'' classes because always saying no, a strategy that defeats the purpose of building a classifier, will achieve high accuracy. The always-no classifier is 99% accurate for a class with relative frequency 1%. For small classes, precision, recall and are better measures. We will use effectiveness as a generic term for measures that evaluate the quality of classification decisions, including precision, recall, , and accuracy. Performance refers to the computational efficiency of classification and IR systems in this book. However, many researchers mean effectiveness, not efficiency of text classification when they use the term performance.  Figure 13.9: A sample document from the Reuters-21578 collection. When we process a collection with several two-class classifiers (such as Reuters-21578 with its 118 classes), we often want to compute a single aggregate measure that combines the measures for individual classifiers. There are two methods for doing this. Macroaveraging computes a simple average over classes. Microaveraging pools per-document decisions across classes, and then computes an effectiveness measure on the pooled contingency table. Table 13.8 gives an example. The differences between the two methods can be large. Macroaveraging gives equal weight to each class, whereas microaveraging gives equal weight to each per-document classification decision. Because the measure ignores true negatives and its magnitude is mostly determined by the number of true positives, large classes dominate small classes in microaveraging. In the example, microaveraged precision (0.83) is much closer to the precision of (0.9) than to the precision of (0.5) because is five times larger than . Microaveraged results are therefore really a measure of effectiveness on the large classes in a test collection. To get a sense of effectiveness on small classes, you should compute macroaveraged results.

Table 13.9 gives microaveraged and macroaveraged effectiveness of Naive Bayes for the ModApte split of Reuters-21578. To give a sense of the relative effectiveness of NB, we compare it with linear SVMs (rightmost column; see Chapter 15 ), one of the most effective classifiers, but also one that is more expensive to train than NB. NB has a microaveraged of 80%, which is 9% less than the SVM (89%), a 10% relative decrease (row ``micro-avg-L (90 classes)''). So there is a surprisingly small effectiveness penalty for its simplicity and efficiency. However, on small classes, some of which only have on the order of ten positive examples in the training set, NB does much worse. Its macroaveraged is 13% below the SVM, a 22% relative decrease (row ``macro-avg (90 classes)'' ). The table also compares NB with the other classifiers we cover in this book: Rocchio and kNN. In addition, we give numbers for decision trees , an important classification method we do not cover. The bottom part of the table shows that there is considerable variation from class to class. For instance, NB beats kNN on ship, but is much worse on money-fx. Comparing parts (a) and (b) of the table, one is struck by the degree to which the cited papers' results differ. This is partly due to the fact that the numbers in (b) are break-even scores (cf. page 8.4 ) averaged over 118 classes, whereas the numbers in (a) are true scores (computed without any knowledge of the test set) averaged over ninety classes. This is unfortunately typical of what happens when comparing different results in text classification: There are often differences in the experimental setup or the evaluation that complicate the interpretation of the results. These and other results have shown that the average effectiveness of NB is uncompetitive with classifiers like SVMs when trained and tested on independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d. ) data, that is, uniform data with all the good properties of statistical sampling. However, these differences may often be invisible or even reverse themselves when working in the real world where, usually, the training sample is drawn from a subset of the data to which the classifier will be applied, the nature of the data drifts over time rather than being stationary (the problem of concept drift we mentioned on page 13.4 ), and there may well be errors in the data (among other problems). Many practitioners have had the experience of being unable to build a fancy classifier for a certain problem that consistently performs better than NB. Our conclusion from the results in Table 13.9 is that, although most researchers believe that an SVM is better than kNN and kNN better than NB, the ranking of classifiers ultimately depends on the class, the document collection, and the experimental setup. In text classification, there is always more to know than simply which machine learning algorithm was used, as we further discuss in Section 15.3 (page ). When performing evaluations like the one in Table 13.9 , it is important to maintain a strict separation between the training set and the test set . We can easily make correct classification decisions on the test set by using information we have gleaned from the test set, such as the fact that a particular term is a good predictor in the test set (even though this is not the case in the training set). A more subtle example of using knowledge about the test set is to try a large number of values of a parameter (e.g., the number of selected features) and select the value that is best for the test set. As a rule, accuracy on new data - the type of data we will encounter when we use the classifier in an application - will be much lower than accuracy on a test set that the classifier has been tuned for. We discussed the same problem in ad hoc retrieval in Section 8.1 (page 8.1 ). In a clean statistical text classification experiment, you should never run any program on or even look at the test set while developing a text classification system. Instead, set aside a development set for testing while you develop your method. When such a set serves the primary purpose of finding a good value for a parameter, for example, the number of selected features, then it is also called held-out data . Train the classifier on the rest of the training set with different parameter values, and then select the value that gives best results on the held-out part of the training set. Ideally, at the very end, when all parameters have been set and the method is fully specified, you run one final experiment on the test set and publish the results. Because no information about the test set was used in developing the classifier, the results of this experiment should be indicative of actual performance in practice. This ideal often cannot be met; researchers tend to evaluate several systems on the same test set over a period of several years. But it is nevertheless highly important to not look at the test data and to run systems on it as sparingly as possible. Beginners often violate this rule, and their results lose validity because they have implicitly tuned their system to the test data simply by running many variant systems and keeping the tweaks to the system that worked best on the test set. Exercises. Assume a situation where every document in the test collection has been assigned exactly one class, and that a classifier also assigns exactly one class to each document. This setup is called one-of classification more-than-two-classes. Show that in one-of classification (i) the total number of false positive decisions equals the total number of false negative decisions and (ii) microaveraged and accuracy are identical. The class priors in Figure 13.2 are computed as the fraction of documents in the class as opposed to the fraction of tokens in the class. Why?

You need not estimate parameters that you don't need for classifying the test document. Your task is to classify words as English or not English.

Assume a training set that reflects the probability distribution of the source perfectly. Make the same independence assumptions that are usually made for a multinomial classifier that uses terms as features for text classification. Compute parameters using smoothing, in which computed-zero probabilities are smoothed into probability 0.01, and computed-nonzero probabilities are untouched. (This simplistic smoothing may cause . Solutions are not required to correct this.) (ii) How does the classifier classify the word zoo? (iii) Classify the word zoo using a multinomial classifier as in part (i), but do not make the assumption of positional independence. That is, estimate separate parameters for each position in a word. You only need to compute the parameters you need for classifying zoo. What are the values of and if term and class are completely independent? What are the values if they are completely dependent? The feature selection method in Equation 130 is most appropriate for the Bernoulli model. Why? How could one modify it for the multinomial model? Features can also be selected according to information gain (IG), which is defined as: (138) where is entropy, is the training set, and , and are the subset of with term , and the subset of without term , respectively. is the class distribution in (sub)collection , e.g., if a quarter of the documents in are in class . Show that mutual information and information gain are equivalent. Show that the two formulas ( and 137 ) are equivalent. In the example on page 13.5.2 we have . Show that this holds in general. and mutual information do not distinguish between positively and negatively correlated features. Because most good text classification features are positively correlated (i.e., they occur more often in than in ), one may want to explicitly rule out the selection of negative indicators. How would you do this?

Bernoulli and multinomial models and their accuracy for different collections are discussed by McCallum and Nigam (1998). Eyheramendy et al. (2003) present additional NB models. Domingos and Pazzani (1997), Friedman (1997), and Hand and Yu (2001) analyze why NB performs well although its probability estimates are poor. The first paper also discusses NB's optimality when the independence assumptions are true of the data. Pavlov et al. (2004) propose a modified document representation that partially addresses the inappropriateness of the independence assumptions. Bennett (2000) attributes the tendency of NB probability estimates to be close to either 0 or 1 to the effect of document length. Ng and Jordan (2001) show that NB is sometimes (although rarely) superior to discriminative methods because it more quickly reaches its optimal error rate. The basic NB model presented in this chapter can be tuned for better effectiveness (Rennie et al. 2003;Kocz and Yih 2007). The problem of concept drift and other reasons why state-of-the-art classifiers do not always excel in practice are discussed by Forman (2006) and Hand (2006).

iir_14	Vector space classification The document representation in Naive Bayes is a sequence of terms or a binary vector . In this chapter we adopt a different representation for text classification, the vector space model, developed in Chapter 6 . It represents each document as a vector with one real-valued component, usually a tf-idf weight, for each term. Thus, the document space , the domain of the classification function , is . This chapter introduces a number of classification methods that operate on real-valued vectors. The basic hypothesis in using the vector space model for classification is the contiguity hypothesis . Contiguity hypothesis. Documents in the same class form a contiguous region and regions of different classes do not overlap. 13 14.1  Figure 14.1: Vector space classification into three classes. Whether or not a set of documents is mapped into a contiguous region depends on the particular choices we make for the document representation: type of weighting, stop list etc. To see that the document representation is crucial, consider the two classes written by a group vs. written by a single person. Frequent occurrence of the first person pronoun I is evidence for the single-person class. But that information is likely deleted from the document representation if we use a stop list. If the document representation chosen is unfavorable, the contiguity hypothesis will not hold and successful vector space classification is not possible. The same considerations that led us to prefer weighted representations, in particular length-normalized tf-idf representations, in Chapters 6 7 also apply here. For example, a term with 5 occurrences in a document should get a higher weight than a term with one occurrence, but a weight 5 times larger would give too much emphasis to the term. Unweighted and unnormalized counts should not be used in vector space classification. We introduce two vector space classification methods in this chapter, Rocchio and kNN. Rocchio classification (Section 14.2 ) divides the vector space into regions centered on centroids or prototypes , one for each class, computed as the center of mass of all documents in the class. Rocchio classification is simple and efficient, but inaccurate if classes are not approximately spheres with similar radii. kNN or nearest neighbor classification (Section 14.3 ) assigns the majority class of the nearest neighbors to a test document. kNN requires no explicit training and can use the unprocessed training set directly in classification. It is less efficient than other classification methods in classifying documents. If the training set is large, then kNN can handle non-spherical and other complex classes better than Rocchio. A large number of text classifiers can be viewed as linear classifiers - classifiers that classify based on a simple linear combination of the features (Section 14.4 ). Such classifiers partition the space of features into regions separated by linear decision hyperplanes , in a manner to be detailed below. Because of the bias-variance tradeoff (Section 14.6 ) more complex nonlinear models are not systematically better than linear models. Nonlinear models have more parameters to fit on a limited amount of training data and are more likely to make mistakes for small and noisy data sets. When applying two-class classifiers to problems with more than two classes, there are one-of tasks - a document must be assigned to exactly one of several mutually exclusive classes - and any-of tasks - a document can be assigned to any number of classes as we will explain in Section 14.5 . Two-class classifiers solve any-of problems and can be combined to solve one-of problems.

iir_14_1	Document representations and measures of relatedness in vector spaces   As in Chapter 6 , we represent documents as vectors in in this chapter. To illustrate properties of document vectors in vector classification, we will render these vectors as points in a plane as in the example in Figure 14.1 . In reality, document vectors are length-normalized unit vectors that point to the surface of a hypersphere. We can view the 2D planes in our figures as projections onto a plane of the surface of a (hyper-)sphere as shown in Figure 14.2 . Distances on the surface of the sphere and on the projection plane are approximately the same as long as we restrict ourselves to small areas of the surface and choose an appropriate projection (Exercise 14.1 ). Decisions of many vector space classifiers are based on a notion of distance, e.g., when computing the nearest neighbors in kNN classification. We will use Euclidean distance in this chapter as the underlying distance measure. We observed earlier (Exercise 6.4.4 , page ) that there is a direct correspondence between cosine similarity and Euclidean distance for length-normalized vectors. In vector space classification, it rarely matters whether the relatedness of two documents is expressed in terms of similarity or distance. However, in addition to documents, centroids or averages of vectors also play an important role in vector space classification. Centroids are not length-normalized. For unnormalized vectors, dot product, cosine similarity and Euclidean distance all have different behavior in general (Exercise 14.8 ). We will be mostly concerned with small local regions when computing the similarity between a document and a centroid, and the smaller the region the more similar the behavior of the three measures is. Exercises. For small areas, distances on the surface of the hypersphere are approximated well by distances on its projection (Figure 14.2 ) because for small angles. For what size angle is the distortion (i) 1.01, (ii) 1.05 and (iii) 1.1?
iir_14_2	Rocchio classification 14.1  decision boundaries  Figure 14.3: Rocchio classification. Perhaps the best-known way of computing good class boundaries is Rocchio classification , which uses centroids to define the boundaries. The centroid of a class is computed as the vector average or center of mass of its members:     (139)          25 6.3.1 14.3 The boundary between two classes in Rocchio classification is the set of points with equal distance from the two centroids. For example, , , and in the figure. This set of points is always a line. The generalization of a line in -dimensional space is a hyperplane, which we define as the set of points that satisfy:     (140)      normal vector     Thus, the boundaries of class regions in Rocchio classification are hyperplanes. The classification rule in Rocchio is to classify a point in accordance with the region it falls into. Equivalently, we determine the centroid that the point is closest to and then assign it to . As an example, consider the star in Figure 14.3 . It is located in the China region of the space and Rocchio therefore assigns it to China. We show the Rocchio algorithm in pseudocode in Figure 14.4 .   Table 14.1: Vectors and class centroids for the data in Table 13.1 .   term weights vector Chinese Japan Tokyo Macao Beijing Shanghai 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.33 0.33 0.33 0 0.71 0.71 0 0 0   Worked example. Table 14.1 shows the tf-idf vector representations of the five documents in Table 13.1 (page 13.1 ), using the formula if (Equation 29, page 6.4.1 ). The two class centroids are and . The distances of the test document from the centroids are and . Thus, Rocchio assigns to . The separating hyperplane in this case has the following parameters:     14.8            End worked example. The assignment criterion in Figure 14.4 is Euclidean distance (APPLYROCCHIO, line 1). An alternative is cosine similarity: (141)  14.1  16.4 16.4  Figure 14.4: Rocchio classification: Training and testing. Rocchio classification is a form of Rocchio relevance feedback (Section 9.1.1 , page 9.1.1 ). The average of the relevant documents, corresponding to the most important component of the Rocchio vector in relevance feedback (Equation 49, page 49 ), is the centroid of the ``class'' of relevant documents. We omit the query component of the Rocchio formula in Rocchio classification since there is no query in text classification. Rocchio classification can be applied to classes whereas Rocchio relevance feedback is designed to distinguish only two classes, relevant and nonrelevant. In addition to respecting contiguity, the classes in Rocchio classification must be approximate spheres with similar radii. In Figure 14.3 , the solid square just below the boundary between UK and Kenya is a better fit for the class UK since UK is more scattered than Kenya. But Rocchio assigns it to Kenya because it ignores details of the distribution of points in a class and only uses distance from the centroid for classification.   The assumption of sphericity also does not hold in Figure 14.5 . We cannot represent the ``a'' class well with a single prototype because it has two clusters. Rocchio often misclassifies this type of multimodal class . A text classification example for multimodality is a country like Burma, which changed its name to Myanmar in 1989. The two clusters before and after the name change need not be close to each other in space. We also encountered the problem of multimodality in relevance feedback (Section 9.1.2 , page 9.1.3 ). Two-class classification is another case where classes are rarely distributed like spheres with similar radii. Most two-class classifiers distinguish between a class like China that occupies a small region of the space and its widely scattered complement. Assuming equal radii will result in a large number of false positives. Most two-class classification problems therefore require a modified decision rule of the form: (142)        mode time complexity training testing Training and test times for Rocchio classification. is the average number of tokens per document. and are the numbers of tokens and types, respectively, in the test document. Computing Euclidean distance between the class centroids and a document is .  Table 14.2 gives the time complexity of Rocchio classification. Adding all documents to their respective (unnormalized) centroid is (as opposed to ) since we need only consider non-zero entries. Dividing each vector sum by the size of its class to compute the centroid is . Overall, training time is linear in the size of the collection (cf. Exercise 13.2.1 ). Thus, Rocchio classification and Naive Bayes have the same linear training time complexity. In the next section, we will introduce another vector space classification method, kNN, that deals better with classes that have non-spherical, disconnected or other irregular shapes.   Exercises. Show that Rocchio classification can assign a label to a document that is different from its training set label.
iir_14_3	k nearest neighbor Unlike Rocchio, nearest neighbor or kNN classification determines the decision boundary locally. For 1NN we assign each document to the class of its closest neighbor. For kNN we assign each document to the majority class of its closest neighbors where is a parameter. The rationale of kNN classification is that, based on the contiguity hypothesis, we expect a test document to have the same label as the training documents located in the local region surrounding . Decision boundaries in 1NN are concatenated segments of the Voronoi tessellation as shown in Figure 14.6 . The Voronoi tessellation of a set of objects decomposes space into Voronoi cells, where each object's cell consists of all points that are closer to the object than to other objects. In our case, the objects are documents. The Voronoi tessellation then partitions the plane into convex polygons, each containing its corresponding document (and no other) as shown in Figure 14.6 , where a convex polygon is a convex region in 2-dimensional space bounded by lines. For general in kNN, consider the region in the space for which the set of nearest neighbors is the same. This again is a convex polygon and the space is partitioned into convex polygons , within each of which the set of nearest neighbors is invariant (Exercise 14.8 ). 1NN is not very robust. The classification decision of each test document relies on the class of a single training document, which may be incorrectly labeled or atypical. kNN for is more robust. It assigns documents to the majority class of their closest neighbors, with ties broken randomly. There is a probabilistic version of this kNN classification algorithm. We can estimate the probability of membership in class as the proportion of the nearest neighbors in . Figure 14.6 gives an example for . Probability estimates for class membership of the star are , , and . The 3nn estimate ( ) and the 1nn estimate ( ) differ with 3nn preferring the X class and 1nn preferring the circle class . The parameter in kNN is often chosen based on experience or knowledge about the classification problem at hand. It is desirable for to be odd to make ties less likely. and are common choices, but much larger values between 50 and 100 are also used. An alternative way of setting the parameter is to select the that gives best results on a held-out portion of the training set.   We can also weight the ``votes'' of the nearest neighbors by their cosine similarity. In this scheme, a class's score is computed as: (143)         Figure 14.7 summarizes the kNN algorithm. Worked example. The distances of the test document from the four training documents in Table 14.1 are and . 's nearest neighbor is therefore and 1NN assigns to 's class, . End worked example.

Table 14.3 gives the time complexity of kNN. kNN has properties that are quite different from most other classification algorithms. Training a kNN classifier simply consists of determining and preprocessing documents. In fact, if we preselect a value for and do not preprocess, then kNN requires no training at all. In practice, we have to perform preprocessing steps like tokenization. It makes more sense to preprocess training documents once as part of the training phase rather than repeatedly every time we classify a new test document. Test time is for kNN. It is linear in the size of the training set as we need to compute the distance of each training document from the test document. Test time is independent of the number of classes . kNN therefore has a potential advantage for problems with large . In kNN classification, we do not perform any estimation of parameters as we do in Rocchio classification (centroids) or in Naive Bayes (priors and conditional probabilities). kNN simply memorizes all examples in the training set and then compares the test document to them. For this reason, kNN is also called memory-based learning or instance-based learning . It is usually desirable to have as much training data as possible in machine learning. But in kNN large training sets come with a severe efficiency penalty in classification. Can kNN testing be made more efficient than or, ignoring the length of documents, more efficient than ? There are fast kNN algorithms for small dimensionality (Exercise 14.8 ). There are also approximations for large that give error bounds for specific efficiency gains (see Section 14.7 ). These approximations have not been extensively tested for text classification applications, so it is not clear whether they can achieve much better efficiency than without a significant loss of accuracy. The reader may have noticed the similarity between the problem of finding nearest neighbors of a test document and ad hoc retrieval, where we search for the documents with the highest similarity to the query (Section 6.3.2 , page 6.3.2 ). In fact, the two problems are both nearest neighbor problems and only differ in the relative density of (the vector of) the test document in kNN (10s or 100s of non-zero entries) versus the sparseness of (the vector of) the query in ad hoc retrieval (usually fewer than 10 non-zero entries). We introduced the inverted index for efficient ad hoc retrieval in Section 1.1 (page 1.1 ). Is the inverted index also the solution for efficient kNN? An inverted index restricts a search to those documents that have at least one term in common with the query. Thus in the context of kNN, the inverted index will be efficient if the test document has no term overlap with a large number of training documents. Whether this is the case depends on the classification problem. If documents are long and no stop list is used, then less time will be saved. But with short documents and a large stop list, an inverted index may well cut the average test time by a factor of 10 or more. The search time in an inverted index is a function of the length of the postings lists of the terms in the query. Postings lists grow sublinearly with the length of the collection since the vocabulary increases according to Heaps' law - if the probability of occurrence of some terms increases, then the probability of occurrence of others must decrease. However, most new terms are infrequent. We therefore take the complexity of inverted index search to be (as discussed in Section 2.4.2 , page 2.4.2 ) and, assuming average document length does not change over time, . As we will see in the next chapter, kNN's effectiveness is close to that of the most accurate learning methods in text classification (Table 15.2 , page 15.2 ). A measure of the quality of a learning method is its Bayes error rate , the average error rate of classifiers learned by it for a particular problem. kNN is not optimal for problems with a non-zero Bayes error rate - that is, for problems where even the best possible classifier has a non-zero classification error. The error of 1NN is asymptotically (as the training set increases) bounded by twice the Bayes error rate. That is, if the optimal classifier has an error rate of , then 1NN has an asymptotic error rate of less than . This is due to the effect of noise - we already saw one example of noise in the form of noisy features in Section 13.5 (page 13.5 ), but noise can also take other forms as we will discuss in the next section. Noise affects two components of kNN: the test document and the closest training document. The two sources of noise are additive, so the overall error of 1NN is twice the optimal error rate. For problems with Bayes error rate 0, the error rate of 1NN will approach 0 as the size of the training set increases. Exercises. Explain why kNN handles multimodal classes better than Rocchio.
iir_14_4	Linear versus nonlinear classifiers In this section, we show that the two learning methods Naive Bayes and Rocchio are instances of linear classifiers, the perhaps most important group of text classifiers, and contrast them with nonlinear classifiers. To simplify the discussion, we will only consider two-class classifiers in this section and define a linear classifier as a two-class classifier that decides class membership by comparing a linear combination of the features to a threshold.  Figure 14.8: There are an infinite number of hyperplanes that separate two linearly separable classes. In two dimensions, a linear classifier is a line. Five examples are shown in Figure 14.8 . These lines have the functional form . The classification rule of a linear classifier is to assign a document to if and to if . Here, is the two-dimensional vector representation of the document and is the parameter vector that defines (together with ) the decision boundary. An alternative geometric interpretation of a linear classifier is provided in Figure 15.7 (page ). We can generalize this 2D linear classifier to higher dimensions by defining a hyperplane as we did in Equation 140, repeated here as Equation 144: (144)        decision hyperplane  Figure 14.9: Linear classification algorithm. The corresponding algorithm for linear classification in dimensions is shown in Figure 14.9 . Linear classification at first seems trivial given the simplicity of this algorithm. However, the difficulty is in training the linear classifier, that is, in determining the parameters and based on the training set. In general, some learning methods compute much better parameters than others where our criterion for evaluating the quality of a learning method is the effectiveness of the learned linear classifier on new data. We now show that Rocchio and Naive Bayes are linear classifiers. To see this for Rocchio, observe that a vector is on the decision boundary if it has equal distance to the two class centroids:     (145)     14.8 We can derive the linearity of Naive Bayes from its decision rule, which chooses the category with the largest (Figure 13.2 , page 13.2 ) where: (146)         (147)   We choose class if the odds are greater than 1 or, equivalently, if the log odds are greater than 0. It is easy to see that Equation 147 is an instance of Equation 144 for , number of occurrences of in , and . Here, the index , , refers to terms of the vocabulary (not to positions in as does; cf. variantmultinomial) and and are -dimensional vectors. So in log space, Naive Bayes is a linear classifier.   prime 0.70 0 1 dlrs -0.71 1 1 rate 0.67 1 0 world -0.35 1 0 interest 0.63 0 0 sees -0.33 0 0 rates 0.60 0 0 year -0.25 0 0 discount 0.46 1 0 group -0.24 0 0 bundesbank 0.43 0 0 dlr -0.24 0 0 A linear classifier.

We assign ``prime dlrs'' to the complement class (not in interest) since . For simplicity, we assume a simple binary vector representation in this example: 1 for occurring terms, 0 for non-occurring terms. End worked example.  A linear problem with noise. In this hypothetical web page classification scenario, Chinese-only web pages are solid circles and mixed Chinese-English web pages are squares. The two classes are separated by a linear class boundary (dashed line, short dashes), except for three noise documents (marked with arrows). Figure 14.10 is a graphical example of a linear problem, which we define to mean that the underlying distributions and of the two classes are separated by a line. We call this separating line the class boundary . It is the ``true'' boundary of the two classes and we distinguish it from the decision boundary that the learning method computes to approximate the class boundary. As is typical in text classification, there are some noise documents in Figure 14.10 (marked with arrows) that do not fit well into the overall distribution of the classes. In Section 13.5 (page 13.5 ), we defined a noise feature as a misleading feature that, when included in the document representation, on average increases the classification error. Analogously, a noise document is a document that, when included in the training set, misleads the learning method and increases classification error. Intuitively, the underlying distribution partitions the representation space into areas with mostly homogeneous class assignments. A document that does not conform with the dominant class in its area is a noise document. Noise documents are one reason why training a linear classifier is hard. If we pay too much attention to noise documents when choosing the decision hyperplane of the classifier, then it will be inaccurate on new data. More fundamentally, it is usually difficult to determine which documents are noise documents and therefore potentially misleading. If there exists a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two classes, then we call the two classes linearly separable . In fact, if linear separability holds, then there is an infinite number of linear separators (Exercise 14.4 ) as illustrated by Figure 14.8 , where the number of possible separating hyperplanes is infinite. Figure 14.8 illustrates another challenge in training a linear classifier. If we are dealing with a linearly separable problem, then we need a criterion for selecting among all decision hyperplanes that perfectly separate the training data. In general, some of these hyperplanes will do well on new data, some will not.  Figure 14.11: A nonlinear problem. An example of a nonlinear classifier is kNN. The nonlinearity of kNN is intuitively clear when looking at examples like Figure 14.6 . The decision boundaries of kNN (the double lines in Figure 14.6 ) are locally linear segments, but in general have a complex shape that is not equivalent to a line in 2D or a hyperplane in higher dimensions. Figure 14.11 is another example of a nonlinear problem: there is no good linear separator between the distributions and because of the circular ``enclave'' in the upper left part of the graph. Linear classifiers misclassify the enclave, whereas a nonlinear classifier like kNN will be highly accurate for this type of problem if the training set is large enough. If a problem is nonlinear and its class boundaries cannot be approximated well with linear hyperplanes, then nonlinear classifiers are often more accurate than linear classifiers. If a problem is linear, it is best to use a simpler linear classifier. Exercises. Prove that the number of linear separators of two classes is either infinite or zero.
iir_14_5	Classification with more than two classes  Classification for classes that are not mutually exclusive is called any-of , multilabel , or multivalue classification . In this case, a document can belong to several classes simultaneously, or to a single class, or to none of the classes. A decision on one class leaves all options open for the others. It is sometimes said that the classes are independent of each other, but this is misleading since the classes are rarely statistically independent in the sense defined on page 13.5.2 . In terms of the formal definition of the classification problem in Equation 112 (page 112 ), we learn different classifiers in any-of classification, each returning either or : . Solving an any-of classification task with linear classifiers is straightforward: Build a classifier for each class, where the training set consists of the set of documents in the class (positive labels) and its complement (negative labels). Given the test document, apply each classifier separately. The decision of one classifier has no influence on the decisions of the other classifiers. The second type of classification with more than two classes is one-of classification . Here, the classes are mutually exclusive. Each document must belong to exactly one of the classes. One-of classification is also called multinomial , polytomous , multiclass , or single-label classification . Formally, there is a single classification function in one-of classification whose range is , i.e., . kNN is a (nonlinear) one-of classifier. True one-of problems are less common in text classification than any-of problems. With classes like UK, China, poultry, or coffee, a document can be relevant to many topics simultaneously - as when the prime minister of the UK visits China to talk about the coffee and poultry trade. Nevertheless, we will often make a one-of assumption, as we did in Figure 14.1 , even if classes are not really mutually exclusive. For the classification problem of identifying the language of a document, the one-of assumption is a good approximation as most text is written in only one language. In such cases, imposing a one-of constraint can increase the classifier's effectiveness because errors that are due to the fact that the any-of classifiers assigned a document to either no class or more than one class are eliminated.  Figure 14.12: hyperplanes do not divide space into disjoint regions.    14.12   Build a classifier for each class, where the training set consists of the set of documents in the class (positive labels) and its complement (negative labels). Given the test document, apply each classifier separately. Assign the document to the class with the maximum score, the maximum confidence value, or the maximum probability.     assigned class money-fx trade interest wheat corn grain true class               money-fx   95 0 10 0 0 0 trade   1 1 90 0 1 0 interest   13 0 0 0 0 0 wheat   0 0 1 34 3 7 corn   1 0 2 13 26 5 grain   0 0 2 14 5 10 A confusion matrix for Reuters-21578.For example, 14 documents from grain were incorrectly assigned to wheat. Adapted from Picca et al. (2006).  An important tool for analyzing the performance of a classifier for classes is the confusion matrix . The confusion matrix shows for each pair of classes , how many documents from were incorrectly assigned to . In Table 14.5 , the classifier manages to distinguish the three financial classes money-fx, trade, and interest from the three agricultural classes wheat, corn, and grain, but makes many errors within these two groups. The confusion matrix can help pinpoint opportunities for improving the accuracy of the system. For example, to address the second largest error in Table 14.5 (14 in the row grain), one could attempt to introduce features that distinguish wheat documents from grain documents. Exercises. Create a training set of 300 documents, 100 each from three different languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish). Create a test set by the same procedure, but also add 100 documents from a fourth language. Train (i) a one-of classifier (ii) an any-of classifier on this training set and evaluate it on the test set. (iii) Are there any interesting differences in how the two classifiers behave on this task?
iir_14_6	The bias-variance tradeoff Nonlinear classifiers are more powerful than linear classifiers. For some problems, there exists a nonlinear classifier with zero classification error, but no such linear classifier. Does that mean that we should always use nonlinear classifiers for optimal effectiveness in statistical text classification? To answer this question, we introduce the bias-variance tradeoff in this section, one of the most important concepts in machine learning. The tradeoff helps explain why there is no universally optimal learning method. Selecting an appropriate learning method is therefore an unavoidable part of solving a text classification problem. Throughout this section, we use linear and nonlinear classifiers as prototypical examples of ``less powerful'' and ``more powerful'' learning, respectively. This is a simplification for a number of reasons. First, many nonlinear models subsume linear models as a special case. For instance, a nonlinear learning method like kNN will in some cases produce a linear classifier. Second, there are nonlinear models that are less complex than linear models. For instance, a quadratic polynomial with two parameters is less powerful than a 10,000-dimensional linear classifier. Third, the complexity of learning is not really a property of the classifier because there are many aspects of learning (such as feature selection, cf. feature, regularization, and constraints such as margin maximization in Chapter 15 ) that make a learning method either more powerful or less powerful without affecting the type of classifier that is the final result of learning - regardless of whether that classifier is linear or nonlinear. We refer the reader to the publications listed in Section 14.7 for a treatment of the bias-variance tradeoff that takes into account these complexities. In this section, linear and nonlinear classifiers will simply serve as proxies for weaker and stronger learning methods in text classification. We first need to state our objective in text classification more precisely. In Section 13.1 (page ), we said that we want to minimize classification error on the test set. The implicit assumption was that training documents and test documents are generated according to the same underlying distribution. We will denote this distribution where is the document and its label or class. graphclassmodelbernoulligraph were examples of generative models that decompose into the product of and . typicallineartypicalnonlinear depict generative models for with and . In this section, instead of using the number of correctly classified test documents (or, equivalently, the error rate on test documents) as evaluation measure, we adopt an evaluation measure that addresses the inherent uncertainty of labeling. In many text classification problems, a given document representation can arise from documents belonging to different classes. This is because documents from different classes can be mapped to the same document representation. For example, the one-sentence documents China sues France and France sues China are mapped to the same document representation in a bag of words model. But only the latter document is relevant to the class legal actions brought by France (which might be defined, for example, as a standing query by an international trade lawyer). To simplify the calculations in this section, we do not count the number of errors on the test set when evaluating a classifier, but instead look at how well the classifier estimates the conditional probability of a document being in a class. In the above example, we might have . Our goal in text classification then is to find a classifier such that, averaged over documents , is as close as possible to the true probability . We measure this using mean squared error:     (148)      We define a classifier to be optimal for a distribution if it minimizes . Minimizing MSE is a desideratum for classifiers. We also need a criterion for learning methods. Recall that we defined a learning method as a function that takes a labeled training set as input and returns a classifier . For learning methods, we adopt as our goal to find a that, averaged over training sets, learns classifiers with minimal MSE. We can formalize this as minimizing learning error :     (149)      We can use learning error as a criterion for selecting a learning method in statistical text classification. A learning method is optimal for a distribution if it minimizes the learning error.  (150)   (151)     (152)   (153)     (154)   (155)       (156) (157)   (158)     (159)   157   150   Writing for for better readability, we can transform Equation 149 as follows: (160)   (161)   (162) (163) (164)   162 157 14.6       Bias is the squared difference between , the true conditional probability of being in , and , the prediction of the learned classifier, averaged over training sets. Bias is large if the learning method produces classifiers that are consistently wrong. Bias is small if (i) the classifiers are consistently right or (ii) different training sets cause errors on different documents or (iii) different training sets cause positive and negative errors on the same documents, but that average out to close to 0. If one of these three conditions holds, then , the expectation over all training sets, is close to . Linear methods like Rocchio and Naive Bayes have a high bias for nonlinear problems because they can only model one type of class boundary, a linear hyperplane. If the generative model has a complex nonlinear class boundary, the bias term in Equation 162 will be high because a large number of points will be consistently misclassified. For example, the circular enclave in Figure 14.11 does not fit a linear model and will be misclassified consistently by linear classifiers. We can think of bias as resulting from our domain knowledge (or lack thereof) that we build into the classifier. If we know that the true boundary between the two classes is linear, then a learning method that produces linear classifiers is more likely to succeed than a nonlinear method. But if the true class boundary is not linear and we incorrectly bias the classifier to be linear, then classification accuracy will be low on average. Nonlinear methods like kNN have low bias. We can see in Figure 14.6 that the decision boundaries of kNN are variable - depending on the distribution of documents in the training set, learned decision boundaries can vary greatly. As a result, each document has a chance of being classified correctly for some training sets. The average prediction is therefore closer to and bias is smaller than for a linear learning method. Variance is the variation of the prediction of learned classifiers: the average squared difference between and its average . Variance is large if different training sets give rise to very different classifiers . It is small if the training set has a minor effect on the classification decisions makes, be they correct or incorrect. Variance measures how inconsistent the decisions are, not whether they are correct or incorrect. Linear learning methods have low variance because most randomly drawn training sets produce similar decision hyperplanes. The decision lines produced by linear learning methods in and 14.11 will deviate slightly from the main class boundaries, depending on the training set, but the class assignment for the vast majority of documents (with the exception of those close to the main boundary) will not be affected. The circular enclave in Figure 14.11 will be consistently misclassified. Nonlinear methods like kNN have high variance. It is apparent from Figure 14.6 that kNN can model very complex boundaries between two classes. It is therefore sensitive to noise documents of the sort depicted in Figure 14.10 . As a result the variance term in Equation 162 is large for kNN: Test documents are sometimes misclassified - if they happen to be close to a noise document in the training set - and sometimes correctly classified - if there are no noise documents in the training set near them. This results in high variation from training set to training set. High-variance learning methods are prone to overfitting the training data. The goal in classification is to fit the training data to the extent that we capture true properties of the underlying distribution . In overfitting, the learning method also learns from noise. Overfitting increases MSE and frequently is a problem for high-variance learning methods. We can also think of variance as the model complexity or, equivalently, memory capacity of the learning method - how detailed a characterization of the training set it can remember and then apply to new data. This capacity corresponds to the number of independent parameters available to fit the training set. Each kNN neighborhood makes an independent classification decision. The parameter in this case is the estimate from Figure 14.7 . Thus, kNN's capacity is only limited by the size of the training set. It can memorize arbitrarily large training sets. In contrast, the number of parameters of Rocchio is fixed - parameters per dimension, one for each centroid - and independent of the size of the training set. The Rocchio classifier (in form of the centroids defining it) cannot ``remember'' fine-grained details of the distribution of the documents in the training set. According to Equation 149, our goal in selecting a learning method is to minimize learning error. The fundamental insight captured by Equation 162, which we can succinctly state as: learning-error = bias + variance, is that the learning error has two components, bias and variance, which in general cannot be minimized simultaneously. When comparing two learning methods and , in most cases the comparison comes down to one method having higher bias and lower variance and the other lower bias and higher variance. The decision for one learning method vs. another is then not simply a matter of selecting the one that reliably produces good classifiers across training sets (small variance) or the one that can learn classification problems with very difficult decision boundaries (small bias). Instead, we have to weigh the respective merits of bias and variance in our application and choose accordingly. This tradeoff is called the bias-variance tradeoff . Figure 14.10 provides an illustration, which is somewhat contrived, but will be useful as an example for the tradeoff. Some Chinese text contains English words written in the Roman alphabet like CPU, ONLINE, and GPS. Consider the task of distinguishing Chinese-only web pages from mixed Chinese-English web pages. A search engine might offer Chinese users without knowledge of English (but who understand loanwords like CPU) the option of filtering out mixed pages. We use two features for this classification task: number of Roman alphabet characters and number of Chinese characters on the web page. As stated earlier, the distribution ) of the generative model generates most mixed (respectively, Chinese) documents above (respectively, below) the short-dashed line, but there are a few noise documents. In Figure 14.10 , we see three classifiers: One-feature classifier. Shown as a dotted horizontal line. This classifier uses only one feature, the number of Roman alphabet characters. Assuming a learning method that minimizes the number of misclassifications in the training set, the position of the horizontal decision boundary is not greatly affected by differences in the training set (e.g., noise documents). So a learning method producing this type of classifier has low variance. But its bias is high since it will consistently misclassify squares in the lower left corner and ``solid circle'' documents with more than 50 Roman characters. Linear classifier. Shown as a dashed line with long dashes. Learning linear classifiers has less bias since only noise documents and possibly a few documents close to the boundary between the two classes are misclassified. The variance is higher than for the one-feature classifiers, but still small: The dashed line with long dashes deviates only slightly from the true boundary between the two classes, and so will almost all linear decision boundaries learned from training sets. Thus, very few documents (documents close to the class boundary) will be inconsistently classified. ``Fit-training-set-perfectly'' classifier. Shown as a solid line. Here, the learning method constructs a decision boundary that perfectly separates the classes in the training set. This method has the lowest bias because there is no document that is consistently misclassified - the classifiers sometimes even get noise documents in the test set right. But the variance of this learning method is high. Because noise documents can move the decision boundary arbitrarily, test documents close to noise documents in the training set will be misclassified - something that a linear learning method is unlikely to do. It is perhaps surprising that so many of the best-known text classification algorithms are linear. Some of these methods, in particular linear SVMs, regularized logistic regression and regularized linear regression, are among the most effective known methods. The bias-variance tradeoff provides insight into their success. Typical classes in text classification are complex and seem unlikely to be modeled well linearly. However, this intuition is misleading for the high-dimensional spaces that we typically encounter in text applications. With increased dimensionality, the likelihood of linear separability increases rapidly (Exercise 14.8 ). Thus, linear models in high-dimensional spaces are quite powerful despite their linearity. Even more powerful nonlinear learning methods can model decision boundaries that are more complex than a hyperplane, but they are also more sensitive to noise in the training data. Nonlinear learning methods sometimes perform better if the training set is large, but by no means in all cases.
iir_14_7	References and further reading As discussed in Chapter 9 , Rocchio relevance feedback is due to Rocchio (1971). Joachims (1997) presents a probabilistic analysis of the method. Rocchio classification was widely used as a classification method in in the 1990s (Buckley et al., 1994b;a, Voorhees and Harman, 2005). Initially, it was used as a form of routing . Routing merely ranks documents according to relevance to a class without assigning them. Early work on filtering , a true classification approach that makes an assignment decision on each document, was published by Ittner et al. (1995) and Schapire et al. (1998). The definition of routing we use here should not be confused with another sense. Routing can also refer to the electronic distribution of documents to subscribers, the so-called push model of document distribution. In a pull model , each transfer of a document to the user is initiated by the user - for example, by means of search or by selecting it from a list of documents on a news aggregation website. Some authors restrict the name Roccchio classification to two-class problems and use the terms cluster-based (Iwayama and Tokunaga, 1995) and centroid-based classification (Han and Karypis, 2000, Tan and Cheng, 2007) for Rocchio classification with . A more detailed treatment of kNN can be found in (Hastie et al., 2001), including methods for tuning the parameter . An example of an approximate fast kNN algorithm is locality-based hashing (Andoni et al., 2006). Kleinberg (1997) presents an approximate kNN algorithm (where is the dimensionality of the space and the number of data points), but at the cost of exponential storage requirements: . Indyk (2004) surveys nearest neighbor methods in high-dimensional spaces. Early work on kNN in text classification was motivated by the availability of massively parallel hardware architectures (Creecy et al., 1992). Yang (1994) uses an inverted index to speed up kNN classification. The optimality result for 1NN (twice the Bayes error rate asymptotically) is due to Cover and Hart (1967). The effectiveness of Rocchio classification and kNN is highly dependent on careful parameter tuning (in particular, the parameters for Rocchio on page 14.2 and for kNN), feature engineering svm-text and feature selection feature. Buckley and Salton (1995), Yang and Kisiel (2003), Schapire et al. (1998) and Moschitti (2003) address these issues for Rocchio and Yang (2001) and Ault and Yang (2002) for kNN. Zavrel et al. (2000) compare feature selection methods for kNN. The bias-variance tradeoff was introduced by Geman et al. (1992). The derivation in Section 14.6 is for , but the tradeoff applies to many loss functions (cf. Friedman (1997), Domingos (2000)). Schütze et al. (1995) and Lewis et al. (1996) discuss linear classifiers for text and Hastie et al. (2001) linear classifiers in general. Readers interested in the algorithms mentioned, but not described in this chapter may wish to consult Bishop (2006) for neural networks, Hastie et al. (2001) for linear and logistic regression, and Minsky and Papert (1988) for the perceptron algorithm . Anagnostopoulos et al. (2006) show that an inverted index can be used for highly efficient document classification with any linear classifier, provided that the classifier is still effective when trained on a modest number of features via feature selection. We have only presented the simplest method for combining two-class classifiers into a one-of classifier. Another important method is the use of error-correcting codes, where a vector of decisions of different two-class classifiers is constructed for each document. A test document's decision vector is then ``corrected'' based on the distribution of decision vectors in the training set, a procedure that incorporates information from all two-class classifiers and their correlations into the final classification decision (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995). Ghamrawi and McCallum (2005) also exploit dependencies between classes in any-of classification. Allwein et al. (2000) propose a general framework for combining two-class classifiers.

iir_15	Support vector machines and machine learning on documents Improving classifier effectiveness has been an area of intensive machine-learning research over the last two decades, and this work has led to a new generation of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as support vector machines, boosted decision trees, regularized logistic regression, neural networks, and random forests. Many of these methods, including support vector machines (SVMs), the main topic of this chapter, have been applied with success to information retrieval problems, particularly text classification. An SVM is a kind of large-margin classifier: it is a vector space based machine learning method where the goal is to find a decision boundary between two classes that is maximally far from any point in the training data (possibly discounting some points as outliers or noise). We will initially motivate and develop SVMs for the case of two-class data sets that are separable by a linear classifier (Section 15.1 ), and then extend the model in Section 15.2 to non-separable data, multi-class problems, and nonlinear models, and also present some additional discussion of SVM performance. The chapter then moves to consider the practical deployment of text classifiers in Section 15.3 : what sorts of classifiers are appropriate when, and how can you exploit domain-specific text features in classification? Finally, we will consider how the machine learning technology that we have been building for text classification can be applied back to the problem of learning how to rank documents in ad hoc retrieval (Section 15.4 ). While several machine learning methods have been applied to this task, use of SVMs has been prominent. Support vector machines are not necessarily better than other machine learning methods (except perhaps in situations with little training data), but they perform at the state-of-the-art level and have much current theoretical and empirical appeal.

iir_15_1	Support vector machines: The linearly separable case  Figure 15.1: The support vectors are the 5 points right up against the margin of the classifier. For two-class, separable training data sets, such as the one in Figure 14.8 (page ), there are lots of possible linear separators. Intuitively, a decision boundary drawn in the middle of the void between data items of the two classes seems better than one which approaches very close to examples of one or both classes. While some learning methods such as the perceptron algorithm (see references in vclassfurther) find just any linear separator, others, like Naive Bayes, search for the best linear separator according to some criterion. The SVM in particular defines the criterion to be looking for a decision surface that is maximally far away from any data point. This distance from the decision surface to the closest data point determines the margin of the classifier. This method of construction necessarily means that the decision function for an SVM is fully specified by a (usually small) subset of the data which defines the position of the separator. These points are referred to as the support vectors (in a vector space, a point can be thought of as a vector between the origin and that point). Figure 15.1 shows the margin and support vectors for a sample problem. Other data points play no part in determining the decision surface that is chosen.  An intuition for large-margin classification.Insisting on a large margin reduces the capacity of the model: the range of angles at which the fat decision surface can be placed is smaller than for a decision hyperplane (cf. vclassline). Maximizing the margin seems good because points near the decision surface represent very uncertain classification decisions: there is almost a 50% chance of the classifier deciding either way. A classifier with a large margin makes no low certainty classification decisions. This gives you a classification safety margin: a slight error in measurement or a slight document variation will not cause a misclassification. Another intuition motivating SVMs is shown in Figure 15.2 . By construction, an SVM classifier insists on a large margin around the decision boundary. Compared to a decision hyperplane, if you have to place a fat separator between classes, you have fewer choices of where it can be put. As a result of this, the memory capacity of the model has been decreased, and hence we expect that its ability to correctly generalize to test data is increased (cf. the discussion of the bias-variance tradeoff in Chapter 14 , page 14.6 ). Let us formalize an SVM with algebra. A decision hyperplane (page 14.4 ) can be defined by an intercept term and a decision hyperplane normal vector which is perpendicular to the hyperplane. This vector is commonly referred to in the machine learning literature as the weight vector . To choose among all the hyperplanes that are perpendicular to the normal vector, we specify the intercept term . Because the hyperplane is perpendicular to the normal vector, all points on the hyperplane satisfy . Now suppose that we have a set of training data points , where each member is a pair of a point and a class label corresponding to it.For SVMs, the two data classes are always named and (rather than 1 and 0), and the intercept term is always explicitly represented as (rather than being folded into the weight vector by adding an extra always-on feature). The math works out much more cleanly if you do things this way, as we will see almost immediately in the definition of functional margin. The linear classifier is then: (165)    We are confident in the classification of a point if it is far away from the decision boundary. For a given data set and decision hyperplane, we define the functional margin of the example with respect to a hyperplane as the quantity . The functional margin of a data set with respect to a decision surface is then twice the functional margin of any of the points in the data set with minimal functional margin (the factor of 2 comes from measuring across the whole width of the margin, as in Figure 15.3 ). However, there is a problem with using this definition as is: the value is underconstrained, because we can always make the functional margin as big as we wish by simply scaling up and . For example, if we replace by and by then the functional margin is five times as large. This suggests that we need to place some constraint on the size of the vector. To get a sense of how to do that, let us look at the actual geometry.  Figure 15.3: The geometric margin of a point ( ) and a decision boundary ( ). What is the Euclidean distance from a point to the decision boundary? In Figure 15.3 , we denote by this distance. We know that the shortest distance between a point and a hyperplane is perpendicular to the plane, and hence, parallel to . A unit vector in this direction is . The dotted line in the diagram is then a translation of the vector . Let us label the point on the hyperplane closest to as . Then: (166)       (167)     (168)   geometric margin  168 15.2       6  Since we can scale the functional margin as we please, for convenience in solving large SVMs, let us choose to require that the functional margin of all data points is at least 1 and that it is equal to 1 for at least one data vector. That is, for all items in the data: (169)      is maximized For all ,      We are now optimizing a quadratic function subject to linear constraints. Quadratic optimization problems are a standard, well-known class of mathematical optimization problems, and many algorithms exist for solving them. We could in principle build our SVM using standard quadratic programming (QP) libraries, but there has been much recent research in this area aiming to exploit the structure of the kind of QP that emerges from an SVM. As a result, there are more intricate but much faster and more scalable libraries available especially for building SVMs, which almost everyone uses to build models. We will not present the details of such algorithms here. However, it will be helpful to what follows to understand the shape of the solution of such an optimization problem. The solution involves constructing a dual problem where a Lagrange multiplier is associated with each constraint in the primal problem: The solution is then of the form: In the solution, most of the are zero. Each non-zero indicates that the corresponding is a support vector. The classification function is then: (170)  dot product     To recap, we start with a training data set. The data set uniquely defines the best separating hyperplane, and we feed the data through a quadratic optimization procedure to find this plane. Given a new point to classify, the classification function in either Equation 165 or Equation 170 is computing the projection of the point onto the hyperplane normal. The sign of this function determines the class to assign to the point. If the point is within the margin of the classifier (or another confidence threshold that we might have determined to minimize classification mistakes) then the classifier can return ``don't know'' rather than one of the two classes. The value of may also be transformed into a probability of classification; fitting a sigmoid to transform the values is standard (Platt, 2000). Also, since the margin is constant, if the model includes dimensions from various sources, careful rescaling of some dimensions may be required. However, this is not a problem if our documents (points) are on the unit hypersphere.  Figure 15.4: A tiny 3 data point training set for an SVM. Worked example. Consider building an SVM over the (very little) data set shown in Figure 15.4 . Working geometrically, for an example like this, the maximum margin weight vector will be parallel to the shortest line connecting points of the two classes, that is, the line between and , giving a weight vector of . The optimal decision surface is orthogonal to that line and intersects it at the halfway point. Therefore, it passes through . So, the SVM decision boundary is: (171)  Working algebraically, with the standard constraint that , we seek to minimize . This happens when this constraint is satisfied with equality by the two support vectors. Further we know that the solution is for some . So we have that:         The margin is . This answer can be confirmed geometrically by examining Figure 15.4 . End worked example. Exercises. What is the minimum number of support vectors that there can be for a data set (which contains instances of each class)? The basis of being able to use kernels in SVMs (see Section 15.2.3 ) is that the classification function can be written in the form of Equation 170 (where, for large problems, most are 0). Show explicitly how the classification function could be written in this form for the data set from small-svm-eg. That is, write as a function where the data points appear and the only variable is . Install an SVM package such as SVMlight (http://svmlight.joachims.org/), and build an SVM for the data set discussed in small-svm-eg. Confirm that the program gives the same solution as the text. For SVMlight, or another package that accepts the same training data format, the training file would be: 1 1:2 2:3 1 1:2 2:0 1 1:1 2:1 The training command for SVMlight is then: svm_learn -c 1 -a alphas.dat train.dat model.dat The -c 1 option is needed to turn off use of the slack variables that we discuss in Section 15.2.1 . Check that the norm of the weight vector agrees with what we found in small-svm-eg. Examine the file alphas.dat which contains the values, and check that they agree with your answers in Exercise 15.1 .
iir_15_2_1	Soft margin classification For the very high dimensional problems common in text classification, sometimes the data are linearly separable. But in the general case they are not, and even if they are, we might prefer a solution that better separates the bulk of the data while ignoring a few weird noise documents.  Figure 15.5: Large margin classification with slack variables. If the training set is not linearly separable, the standard approach is to allow the fat decision margin to make a few mistakes (some points - outliers or noisy examples - are inside or on the wrong side of the margin). We then pay a cost for each misclassified example, which depends on how far it is from meeting the margin requirement given in Equation 169. To implement this, we introduce slack variables . A non-zero value for allows to not meet the margin requirement at a cost proportional to the value of . See Figure 15.5 . The formulation of the SVM optimization problem with slack variables is: The optimization problem is then trading off how fat it can make the margin versus how many points have to be moved around to allow this margin. The margin can be less than 1 for a point by setting , but then one pays a penalty of in the minimization for having done that. The sum of the gives an upper bound on the number of training errors. Soft-margin SVMs minimize training error traded off against margin. The parameter is a regularization term, which provides a way to control overfitting: as becomes large, it is unattractive to not respect the data at the cost of reducing the geometric margin; when it is small, it is easy to account for some data points with the use of slack variables and to have a fat margin placed so it models the bulk of the data. The dual problem for soft margin classification becomes: Neither the slack variables nor Lagrange multipliers for them appear in the dual problem. All we are left with is the constant bounding the possible size of the Lagrange multipliers for the support vector data points. As before, the with non-zero will be the support vectors. The solution of the dual problem is of the form: Again is not needed explicitly for classification, which can be done in terms of dot products with data points, as in Equation 170. Typically, the support vectors will be a small proportion of the training data. However, if the problem is non-separable or with small margin, then every data point which is misclassified or within the margin will have a non-zero . If this set of points becomes large, then, for the nonlinear case which we turn to in Section 15.2.3 , this can be a major slowdown for using SVMs at test time.

For SVMs, multiclass classification is assumed to be done by a set of one-versus-rest classifiers. is the average number of tokens per document, while is the average vocabulary (number of non-zero features) of a document. and are the numbers of tokens and types, respectively, in the test document.  The complexity of training and testing with linear SVMs is shown in Table 15.1 . The time for training an SVM is dominated by the time for solving the underlying QP, and so the theoretical and empirical complexity varies depending on the method used to solve it. The standard result for solving QPs is that it takes time cubic in the size of the data set (Kozlov et al., 1979). All the recent work on SVM training has worked to reduce that complexity, often by being satisfied with approximate solutions. Standardly, empirical complexity is about (Joachims, 2006a). Nevertheless, the super-linear training time of traditional SVM algorithms makes them difficult or impossible to use on very large training data sets. Alternative traditional SVM solution algorithms which are linear in the number of training examples scale badly with a large number of features, which is another standard attribute of text problems. However, a new training algorithm based on cutting plane techniques gives a promising answer to this issue by having running time linear in the number of training examples and the number of non-zero features in examples (Joachims, 2006a). Nevertheless, the actual speed of doing quadratic optimization remains much slower than simply counting terms as is done in a Naive Bayes model. Extending SVM algorithms to nonlinear SVMs, as in the next section, standardly increases training complexity by a factor of (since dot products between examples need to be calculated), making them impractical. In practice it can often be cheaper to materialize the higher-order features and to train a linear SVM.
iir_15_2_2	Multiclass SVMs SVMs are inherently two-class classifiers. The traditional way to do multiclass classification with SVMs is to use one of the methods discussed in Section 14.5 (page 14.5 ). In particular, the most common technique in practice has been to build one-versus-rest classifiers (commonly referred to as ``one-versus-all'' or OVA classification), and to choose the class which classifies the test datum with greatest margin. Another strategy is to build a set of one-versus-one classifiers, and to choose the class that is selected by the most classifiers. While this involves building classifiers, the time for training classifiers may actually decrease, since the training data set for each classifier is much smaller. However, these are not very elegant approaches to solving multiclass problems. A better alternative is provided by the construction of multiclass SVMs, where we build a two-class classifier over a feature vector derived from the pair consisting of the input features and the class of the datum. At test time, the classifier chooses the class . The margin during training is the gap between this value for the correct class and for the nearest other class, and so the quadratic program formulation will require that . This general method can be extended to give a multiclass formulation of various kinds of linear classifiers. It is also a simple instance of a generalization of classification where the classes are not just a set of independent, categorical labels, but may be arbitrary structured objects with relationships defined between them. In the SVM world, such work comes under the label of structural SVMs . We mention them again in Section 15.4.2 .
iir_15_2_3	Nonlinear SVMs  Figure 15.6: Projecting data that is not linearly separable into a higher dimensional space can make it linearly separable. With what we have presented so far, data sets that are linearly separable (perhaps with a few exceptions or some noise) are well-handled. But what are we going to do if the data set just doesn't allow classification by a linear classifier? Let us look at a one-dimensional case. The top data set in Figure 15.6 is straightforwardly classified by a linear classifier but the middle data set is not. We instead need to be able to pick out an interval. One way to solve this problem is to map the data on to a higher dimensional space and then to use a linear classifier in the higher dimensional space. For example, the bottom part of the figure shows that a linear separator can easily classify the data if we use a quadratic function to map the data into two dimensions (a polar coordinates projection would be another possibility). The general idea is to map the original feature space to some higher-dimensional feature space where the training set is separable. Of course, we would want to do so in ways that preserve relevant dimensions of relatedness between data points, so that the resultant classifier should still generalize well. SVMs, and also a number of other linear classifiers, provide an easy and efficient way of doing this mapping to a higher dimensional space, which is referred to as ``the kernel trick ''. It's not really a trick: it just exploits the math that we have seen. The SVM linear classifier relies on a dot product between data point vectors. Let . Then the classifier we have seen so far is: (172)      172  kernel function  Worked example. The quadratic kernel in two dimensions.quad-kernel For 2-dimensional vectors , , consider . We wish to show that this is a kernel, i.e., that for some . Consider . Then: (173)   (174)   (175)   (176)   End worked example. In the language of functional analysis, what kinds of functions are valid kernel functions ? Kernel functions are sometimes more precisely referred to as Mercer kernels , because they must satisfy Mercer's condition: for any such that is finite, we must have that: (177)     15.5 The two commonly used families of kernels are polynomial kernels and radial basis functions. Polynomial kernels are of the form . The case of is a linear kernel, which is what we had before the start of this section (the constant 1 just changing the threshold). The case of gives a quadratic kernel, and is very commonly used. We illustrated the quadratic kernel in quad-kernel. The most common form of radial basis function is a Gaussian distribution, calculated as: (178)  15.5 The world of SVMs comes with its own language, which is rather different from the language otherwise used in machine learning. The terminology does have deep roots in mathematics, but it's important not to be too awed by that terminology. Really, we are talking about some quite simple things. A polynomial kernel allows us to model feature conjunctions (up to the order of the polynomial). That is, if we want to be able to model occurrences of pairs of words, which give distinctive information about topic classification, not given by the individual words alone, like perhaps operating and system or ethnic and cleansing, then we need to use a quadratic kernel. If occurrences of triples of words give distinctive information, then we need to use a cubic kernel. Simultaneously you also get the powers of the basic features - for most text applications, that probably isn't useful, but just comes along with the math and hopefully doesn't do harm. A radial basis function allows you to have features that pick out circles (hyperspheres) - although the decision boundaries become much more complex as multiple such features interact. A string kernel lets you have features that are character subsequences of terms. All of these are straightforward notions which have also been used in many other places under different names.

Results are shown for the 10 largest categories and for microaveraged performance over all 90 categories on the Reuters-21578 data set.  We presented results in Section 13.6 showing that an SVM is a very effective text classifier. The results of Dumais et al. (1998) given in Table 13.9 show SVMs clearly performing the best. This was one of several pieces of work from this time that established the strong reputation of SVMs for text classification. Another pioneering work on scaling and evaluating SVMs for text classification was (Joachims, 1998). We present some of his results from (Joachims, 2002a) in Table 15.2 .Joachims used a large number of term features in contrast to Dumais et al. (1998), who used MI feature selection (Section 13.5.1 , page 13.5.1 ) to build classifiers with a much more limited number of features. The success of the linear SVM mirrors the results discussed in Section 14.6 (page ) on other linear approaches like Naive Bayes. It seems that working with simple term features can get one a long way. It is again noticeable the extent to which different papers' results for the same machine learning methods differ. In particular, based on replications by other researchers, the Naive Bayes results of (Joachims, 1998) appear too weak, and the results in Table 13.9 should be taken as representative.
iir_15_3	Issues in the classification of text documents There are lots of applications of text classification in the commercial world; email spam filtering is perhaps now the most ubiquitous. Jackson and Moulinier (2002) write: ``There is no question concerning the commercial value of being able to classify documents automatically by content. There are myriad potential applications of such a capability for corporate Intranets, government departments, and Internet publishers.'' Most of our discussion of classification has focused on introducing various machine learning methods rather than discussing particular features of text documents relevant to classification. This bias is appropriate for a textbook, but is misplaced for an application developer. It is frequently the case that greater performance gains can be achieved from exploiting domain-specific text features than from changing from one machine learning method to another. Jackson and Moulinier (2002) suggest that ``Understanding the data is one of the keys to successful categorization, yet this is an area in which most categorization tool vendors are extremely weak. Many of the `one size fits all' tools on the market have not been tested on a wide range of content types.'' In this section we wish to step back a little and consider the applications of text classification, the space of possible solutions, and the utility of application-specific heuristics.

iir_15_3_1	Choosing what kind of classifier to use When confronted with a need to build a text classifier, the first question to ask is how much training data is there currently available? None? Very little? Quite a lot? Or a huge amount, growing every day? Often one of the biggest practical challenges in fielding a machine learning classifier in real applications is creating or obtaining enough training data. For many problems and algorithms, hundreds or thousands of examples from each class are required to produce a high performance classifier and many real world contexts involve large sets of categories. We will initially assume that the classifier is needed as soon as possible; if a lot of time is available for implementation, much of it might be spent on assembling data resources. If you have no labeled training data, and especially if there are existing staff knowledgeable about the domain of the data, then you should never forget the solution of using hand-written rules. That is, you write standing queries, as we touched on at the beginning of Chapter 13 . For example: if (wheat or grain) and not (whole or bread) then Jacobs and Rau (1990) Hayes and Weinstein (1990)  13.4 If you have fairly little data and you are going to train a supervised classifier, then machine learning theory says you should stick to a classifier with high bias, as we discussed in Section 14.6 (page ). For example, there are theoretical and empirical results that Naive Bayes does well in such circumstances (Forman and Cohen, 2004, Ng and Jordan, 2001), although this effect is not necessarily observed in practice with regularized models over textual data (Klein and Manning, 2002). At any rate, a very low bias model like a nearest neighbor model is probably counterindicated. Regardless, the quality of the model will be adversely affected by the limited training data. Here, the theoretically interesting answer is to try to apply semi-supervised training methods . This includes methods such as bootstrapping or the EM algorithm, which we will introduce in Section 16.5 (page ). In these methods, the system gets some labeled documents, and a further large supply of unlabeled documents over which it can attempt to learn. One of the big advantages of Naive Bayes is that it can be straightforwardly extended to be a semi-supervised learning algorithm, but for SVMs, there is also semi-supervised learning work which goes under the title of transductive SVMs . See the references for pointers. Often, the practical answer is to work out how to get more labeled data as quickly as you can. The best way to do this is to insert yourself into a process where humans will be willing to label data for you as part of their natural tasks. For example, in many cases humans will sort or route email for their own purposes, and these actions give information about classes. The alternative of getting human labelers expressly for the task of training classifiers is often difficult to organize, and the labeling is often of lower quality, because the labels are not embedded in a realistic task context. Rather than getting people to label all or a random sample of documents, there has also been considerable research on active learning , where a system is built which decides which documents a human should label. Usually these are the ones on which a classifier is uncertain of the correct classification. This can be effective in reducing annotation costs by a factor of 2-4, but has the problem that the good documents to label to train one type of classifier often are not the good documents to label to train a different type of classifier. If there is a reasonable amount of labeled data, then you are in the perfect position to use everything that we have presented about text classification. For instance, you may wish to use an SVM. However, if you are deploying a linear classifier such as an SVM, you should probably design an application that overlays a Boolean rule-based classifier over the machine learning classifier. Users frequently like to adjust things that do not come out quite right, and if management gets on the phone and wants the classification of a particular document fixed right now, then this is much easier to do by hand-writing a rule than by working out how to adjust the weights of an SVM without destroying the overall classification accuracy. This is one reason why machine learning models like decision trees which produce user-interpretable Boolean-like models retain considerable popularity. If a huge amount of data are available, then the choice of classifier probably has little effect on your results and the best choice may be unclear (cf. Banko and Brill, 2001). It may be best to choose a classifier based on the scalability of training or even runtime efficiency. To get to this point, you need to have huge amounts of data. The general rule of thumb is that each doubling of the training data size produces a linear increase in classifier performance, but with very large amounts of data, the improvement becomes sub-linear.
iir_15_3_2	Improving classifier performance For any particular application, there is usually significant room for improving classifier effectiveness through exploiting features specific to the domain or document collection. Often documents will contain zones which are especially useful for classification. Often there will be particular subvocabularies which demand special treatment for optimal classification effectiveness.

Connections to text summarization.
iir_15_4	Machine learning methods in ad hoc information retrieval Rather than coming up with term and document weighting functions by hand, as we primarily did in Chapter 6 , we can view different sources of relevance signal (cosine score, title match, etc.) as features in a learning problem. A classifier that has been fed examples of relevant and nonrelevant documents for each of a set of queries can then figure out the relative weights of these signals. If we configure the problem so that there are pairs of a document and a query which are assigned a relevance judgment of relevant or nonrelevant, then we can think of this problem too as a text classification problem. Taking such a classification approach is not necessarily best, and we present an alternative in Section 15.4.2 . Nevertheless, given the material we have covered, the simplest place to start is to approach this problem as a classification problem, by ordering the documents according to the confidence of a two-class classifier in its relevance decision. And this move is not purely pedagogical; exactly this approach is sometimes used in practice.   Subsections A simple example of machine-learned scoring Result ranking by machine learning
iir_15_4_1	A simple example of machine-learned scoring In this section we generalize the methodology of Section 6.1.2 (page ) to machine learning of the scoring function. In Section 6.1.2 we considered a case where we had to combine Boolean indicators of relevance; here we consider more general factors to further develop the notion of machine-learned relevance . In particular, the factors we now consider go beyond Boolean functions of query term presence in document zones, as in Section 6.1.2 . We develop the ideas in a setting where the scoring function is a linear combination of two factors: (1) the vector space cosine similarity between query and document and (2) the minimum window width within which the query terms lie. As we noted in Section 7.2.2 (page ), query term proximity is often very indicative of a document being on topic, especially with longer documents and on the web. Among other things, this quantity gives us an implementation of implicit phrases. Thus we have one factor that depends on the statistics of query terms in the document as a bag of words, and another that depends on proximity weighting. We consider only two features in the development of the ideas because a two-feature exposition remains simple enough to visualize. The technique can be generalized to many more features. As in Section 6.1.2 , we are provided with a set of training examples, each of which is a pair consisting of a query and a document, together with a relevance judgment for that document on that query that is either relevant or nonrelevant. For each such example we can compute the vector space cosine similarity, as well as the window width . The result is a training set as shown in Table 15.3 , which resembles Figure 6.5 (page ) from Section 6.1.2 .   Table 15.3: Training examples for machine-learned scoring. Example DocID Query Cosine score Judgment 37 linux operating system 0.032 3 relevant 37 penguin logo 0.02 4 nonrelevant 238 operating system 0.043 2 relevant 238 runtime environment 0.004 2 nonrelevant 1741 kernel layer 0.022 3 relevant 2094 device driver 0.03 2 relevant 3191 device driver 0.027 5 nonrelevant   Here, the two features (cosine score denoted and window width ) are real-valued predictors. If we once again quantify the judgment relevant as 1 and nonrelevant as 0, we seek a scoring function that combines the values of the features to generate a value that is (close to) 0 or 1. We wish this function to be in agreement with our set of training examples as far as possible. Without loss of generality, a linear classifier will use a linear combination of features of the form (179)   6.1.2 179 15.3   15.7  A collection of training examples.Each R denotes a training example labeled relevant, while each N is a training example labeled nonrelevant. In this setting, the function from Equation 179 represents a plane ``hanging above'' Figure 15.7 . Ideally this plane (in the direction perpendicular to the page containing Figure 15.7 ) assumes values close to 1 above the points marked R, and values close to 0 above the points marked N. Since a plane is unlikely to assume only values close to 0 or 1 above the training sample points, we make use of thresholding: given any query and document for which we wish to determine relevance, we pick a value and if we declare the document to be relevant, else we declare the document to be nonrelevant. As we know from Figure 14.8 (page ), all points that satisfy form a line (shown as a dashed line in Figure 15.7 ) and we thus have a linear classifier that separates relevant from nonrelevant instances. Geometrically, we can find the separating line as follows. Consider the line passing through the plane whose height is above the page containing Figure 15.7 . Project this line down onto Figure 15.7 ; this will be the dashed line in Figure 15.7 . Then, any subsequent query/document pair that falls below the dashed line in Figure 15.7 is deemed nonrelevant; above the dashed line, relevant. Thus, the problem of making a binary relevant/nonrelevant judgment given training examples as above turns into one of learning the dashed line in Figure 15.7 separating relevant training examples from the nonrelevant ones. Being in the - plane, this line can be written as a linear equation involving and , with two parameters (slope and intercept). The methods of linear classification that we have already looked at in classificationsvm provide methods for choosing this line. Provided we can build a sufficiently rich collection of training samples, we can thus altogether avoid hand-tuning score functions as in Section 7.2.3 (page ). The bottleneck of course is the ability to maintain a suitably representative set of training examples, whose relevance assessments must be made by experts.
iir_15_4_2	Result ranking by machine learning The above ideas can be readily generalized to functions of many more than two variables. There are lots of other scores that are indicative of the relevance of a document to a query, including static quality (PageRank-style measures, discussed in Chapter 21 ), document age, zone contributions, document length, and so on. Providing that these measures can be calculated for a training document collection with relevance judgments, any number of such measures can be used to train a machine learning classifier. For instance, we could train an SVM over binary relevance judgments, and order documents based on their probability of relevance, which is monotonic with the documents' signed distance from the decision boundary. However, approaching IR result ranking like this is not necessarily the right way to think about the problem. Statisticians normally first divide problems into classification problems (where a categorical variable is predicted) versus regression problems (where a real number is predicted). In between is the specialized field of ordinal regression where a ranking is predicted. Machine learning for ad hoc retrieval is most properly thought of as an ordinal regression problem, where the goal is to rank a set of documents for a query, given training data of the same sort. This formulation gives some additional power, since documents can be evaluated relative to other candidate documents for the same query, rather than having to be mapped to a global scale of goodness, while also weakening the problem space, since just a ranking is required rather than an absolute measure of relevance. Issues of ranking are especially germane in web search, where the ranking at the very top of the results list is exceedingly important, whereas decisions of relevance of a document to a query may be much less important. Such work can and has been pursued using the structural SVM framework which we mentioned in Section 15.2.2 , where the class being predicted is a ranking of results for a query, but here we will present the slightly simpler ranking SVM. The construction of a ranking SVM proceeds as follows. We begin with a set of judged queries. For each training query , we have a set of documents returned in response to the query, which have been totally ordered by a person for relevance to the query. We construct a vector of features for each document/query pair, using features such as those discussed in Section 15.4.1 , and many more. For two documents and , we then form the vector of feature differences: (180)  By hypothesis, one of and has been judged more relevant. If is judged more relevant than , denoted ( should precede in the results ordering), then we will assign the vector the class ; otherwise . The goal then is to build a classifier which will return (181)       Both of the methods that we have just looked at use a linear weighting of document features that are indicators of relevance, as has most work in this area. It is therefore perhaps interesting to note that much of traditional IR weighting involves nonlinear scaling of basic measurements (such as log-weighting of term frequency, or idf). At the present time, machine learning is very good at producing optimal weights for features in a linear combination (or other similar restricted model classes), but it is not good at coming up with good nonlinear scalings of basic measurements. This area remains the domain of human feature engineering. The idea of learning ranking functions has been around for a number of years, but it is only very recently that sufficient machine learning knowledge, training document collections, and computational power have come together to make this method practical and exciting. It is thus too early to write something definitive on machine learning approaches to ranking in information retrieval, but there is every reason to expect the use and importance of machine learned ranking approaches to grow over time. While skilled humans can do a very good job at defining ranking functions by hand, hand tuning is difficult, and it has to be done again for each new document collection and class of users. Exercises. Plot the first 7 rows of Table 15.3 in the - plane to produce a figure like that in Figure 15.7 . Write down the equation of a line in the - plane separating the Rs from the Ns. Give a training example (consisting of values for and the relevance judgment) that when added to the training set makes it impossible to separate the R's from the N's using a line in the - plane.
iir_15_5	References and further reading The somewhat quirky name support vector machine originates in the neural networks literature, where learning algorithms were thought of as architectures, and often referred to as ``machines''. The distinctive element of this model is that the decision boundary to use is completely decided (``supported'') by a few training data points, the support vectors. For a more detailed presentation of SVMs, a good, well-known article-length introduction is (Burges, 1998). Chen et al. (2005) introduce the more recent -SVM, which provides an alternative parameterization for dealing with inseparable problems, whereby rather than specifying a penalty , you specify a parameter which bounds the number of examples which can appear on the wrong side of the decision surface. There are now also several books dedicated to SVMs, large margin learning, and kernels: (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) and (Schölkopf and Smola, 2001) are more mathematically oriented, while (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) aims to be more practical. For the foundations by their originator, see (Vapnik, 1998). Some recent, more general books on statistical learning, such as (Hastie et al., 2001) also give thorough coverage of SVMs. The construction of multiclass SVMs is discussed in (Weston and Watkins, 1999), (Crammer and Singer, 2001), and (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005). The last reference provides an introduction to the general framework of structural SVMs. The kernel trick was first presented in (Aizerman et al., 1964). For more about string kernels and other kernels for structured data, see (Lodhi et al., 2002) and (Gaertner et al., 2002). The Advances in Neural Information Processing (NIPS) conferences have become the premier venue for theoretical machine learning work, such as on SVMs. Other venues such as SIGIR are much stronger on experimental methodology and using text-specific features to improve classifier effectiveness. A recent comparison of most current machine learning classifiers (though on problems rather different from typical text problems) can be found in (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006). (Li and Yang, 2003), discussed in Section 13.6 , is the most recent comparative evaluation of machine learning classifiers on text classification. Older examinations of classifiers on text problems can be found in (Yang and Liu, 1999, Dumais et al., 1998, Yang, 1999). Joachims (2002a) presents his work on SVMs applied to text problems in detail. Zhang and Oles (2001) present an insightful comparison of Naive Bayes, regularized logistic regression and SVM classifiers. Joachims (1999) discusses methods of making SVM learning practical over large text data sets. Joachims (2006a) improves on this work. A number of approaches to hierarchical classification have been developed in order to deal with the common situation where the classes to be assigned have a natural hierarchical organization (Weigend et al., 1999, Dumais and Chen, 2000, Koller and Sahami, 1997, McCallum et al., 1998). In a recent large study on scaling SVMs to the entire Yahoo! directory, Liu et al. (2005) conclude that hierarchical classification noticeably if still modestly outperforms flat classification. Classifier effectiveness remains limited by the very small number of training documents for many classes. For a more general approach that can be applied to modeling relations between classes, which may be arbitrary rather than simply the case of a hierarchy, see Tsochantaridis et al. (2005). Moschitti and Basili (2004) investigate the use of complex nominals, proper nouns and word senses as features in text classification. Dietterich (2002) overviews ensemble methods for classifier combination, while Schapire (2003) focuses particularly on boosting, which is applied to text classification in (Schapire and Singer, 2000). Chapelle et al. (2006) present an introduction to work in semi-supervised methods, including in particular chapters on using EM for semi-supervised text classification (Nigam et al., 2006) and on transductive SVMs (Joachims, 2006b). Sindhwani and Keerthi (2006) present a more efficient implementation of a transductive SVM for large data sets. Tong and Koller (2001) explore active learning with SVMs for text classification; Baldridge and Osborne (2004) point out that examples selected for annotation with one classifier in an active learning context may be no better than random examples when used with another classifier. Machine learning approaches to ranking for ad hoc retrieval were pioneered in (Wong et al., 1988), (Fuhr, 1992), and (Gey, 1994). But limited training data and poor machine learning techniques meant that these pieces of work achieved only middling results, and hence they only had limited impact at the time. Taylor et al. (2006) study using machine learning to tune the parameters of the BM25 family of ranking functions okapi-bm25 so as to maximize NDCG (Section 8.4 , page 8.4 ). Machine learning approaches to ordinal regression appear in (Herbrich et al., 2000) and (Burges et al., 2005), and are applied to clickstream data in (Joachims, 2002b). Cao et al. (2006) study how to make this approach effective in IR, and Qin et al. (2007) suggest an extension involving using multiple hyperplanes. Yue et al. (2007) study how to do ranking with a structural SVM approach, and in particular show how this construction can be effectively used to directly optimize for MAP ranked-evaluation, rather than using surrogate measures like accuracy or area under the ROC curve. Geng et al. (2007) study feature selection for the ranking problem. Other approaches to learning to rank have also been shown to be effective for web search, such as (Richardson et al., 2006, Burges et al., 2005).
iir_16	Flat clustering Clustering algorithms group a set of documents into subsets or clusters . The algorithms' goal is to create clusters that are coherent internally, but clearly different from each other. In other words, documents within a cluster should be as similar as possible; and documents in one cluster should be as dissimilar as possible from documents in other clusters.  Figure 16.1: An example of a data set with a clear cluster structure. Clustering is the most common form of unsupervised learning . No supervision means that there is no human expert who has assigned documents to classes. In clustering, it is the distribution and makeup of the data that will determine cluster membership. A simple example is Figure 16.1 . It is visually clear that there are three distinct clusters of points. This chapter and Chapter 17 introduce algorithms that find such clusters in an unsupervised fashion. The difference between clustering and classification may not seem great at first. After all, in both cases we have a partition of a set of documents into groups. But as we will see the two problems are fundamentally different. Classification is a form of supervised learning (Chapter 13 , page 13.1 ): our goal is to replicate a categorical distinction that a human supervisor imposes on the data. In unsupervised learning, of which clustering is the most important example, we have no such teacher to guide us. The key input to a clustering algorithm is the distance measure. In Figure 16.1 , the distance measure is distance in the 2D plane. This measure suggests three different clusters in the figure. In document clustering, the distance measure is often also Euclidean distance. Different distance measures give rise to different clusterings. Thus, the distance measure is an important means by which we can influence the outcome of clustering. Flat clustering creates a flat set of clusters without any explicit structure that would relate clusters to each other. Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters and will be covered in Chapter 17 . Chapter 17 also addresses the difficult problem of labeling clusters automatically. A second important distinction can be made between hard and soft clustering algorithms. Hard clustering computes a hard assignment - each document is a member of exactly one cluster. The assignment of soft clustering algorithms is soft - a document's assignment is a distribution over all clusters. In a soft assignment, a document has fractional membership in several clusters. Latent semantic indexing, a form of dimensionality reduction, is a soft clustering algorithm (Chapter 18 , page 18.4 ). This chapter motivates the use of clustering in information retrieval by introducing a number of applications (Section 16.1 ), defines the problem we are trying to solve in clustering (Section 16.2 ) and discusses measures for evaluating cluster quality (Section 16.3 ). It then describes two flat clustering algorithms, -means (Section 16.4 ), a hard clustering algorithm, and the Expectation-Maximization (or EM) algorithm (Section 16.5 ), a soft clustering algorithm. -means is perhaps the most widely used flat clustering algorithm due to its simplicity and efficiency. The EM algorithm is a generalization of -means and can be applied to a large variety of document representations and distributions.

iir_16_1	Clustering in information retrieval  cluster hypothesis Cluster hypothesis. Documents in the same cluster behave similarly with respect to relevance to information needs. 14 14   Table 16.1: Some applications of clustering in information retrieval. Application What is Benefit Example   clustered?     Search result clustering search results more effective information presentation to user Figure 16.2 Scatter-Gather (subsets of) collection alternative user interface: ``search without typing'' Figure 16.3 Collection clustering collection effective information presentation for exploratory browsing McKeown et al. (2002), http://news.google.com Language modeling collection increased precision and/or recall Liu and Croft (2004) Cluster-based retrieval collection higher efficiency: faster search Salton (1971a)   Table 16.1 shows some of the main applications of clustering in information retrieval. They differ in the set of documents that they cluster - search results, collection or subsets of the collection - and the aspect of an information retrieval system they try to improve - user experience, user interface, effectiveness or efficiency of the search system. But they are all based on the basic assumption stated by the cluster hypothesis.  Clustering of search results to improve recall. None of the top hits cover the animal sense of jaguar, but users can easily access it by clicking on the cat cluster in the Clustered Results panel on the left (third arrow from the top). The first application mentioned in Table 16.1 is search result clustering where by search results we mean the documents that were returned in response to a query. The default presentation of search results in information retrieval is a simple list. Users scan the list from top to bottom until they have found the information they are looking for. Instead, search result clustering clusters the search results, so that similar documents appear together. It is often easier to scan a few coherent groups than many individual documents. This is particularly useful if a search term has different word senses. The example in Figure 16.2 is jaguar. Three frequent senses on the web refer to the car, the animal and an Apple operating system. The Clustered Results panel returned by the Vivísimo search engine (http://vivisimo.com) can be a more effective user interface for understanding what is in the search results than a simple list of documents.  An example of a user session in Scatter-Gather. A collection of New York Times news stories is clustered (``scattered'') into eight clusters (top row). The user manually gathers three of these into a smaller collection International Stories and performs another scattering operation. This process repeats until a small cluster with relevant documents is found (e.g., Trinidad). A better user interface is also the goal of Scatter-Gather , the second application in Table 16.1 . Scatter-Gather clusters the whole collection to get groups of documents that the user can select or gather. The selected groups are merged and the resulting set is again clustered. This process is repeated until a cluster of interest is found. An example is shown in Figure 16.3 . Automatically generated clusters like those in Figure 16.3 are not as neatly organized as a manually constructed hierarchical tree like the Open Directory at http://dmoz.org. Also, finding descriptive labels for clusters automatically is a difficult problem (Section 17.7 , page 17.7 ). But cluster-based navigation is an interesting alternative to keyword searching, the standard information retrieval paradigm. This is especially true in scenarios where users prefer browsing over searching because they are unsure about which search terms to use. As an alternative to the user-mediated iterative clustering in Scatter-Gather, we can also compute a static hierarchical clustering of a collection that is not influenced by user interactions (``Collection clustering'' in Table 16.1 ). Google News and its precursor, the Columbia NewsBlaster system, are examples of this approach. In the case of news, we need to frequently recompute the clustering to make sure that users can access the latest breaking stories. Clustering is well suited for access to a collection of news stories since news reading is not really search, but rather a process of selecting a subset of stories about recent events. The fourth application of clustering exploits the cluster hypothesis directly for improving search results, based on a clustering of the entire collection. We use a standard inverted index to identify an initial set of documents that match the query, but we then add other documents from the same clusters even if they have low similarity to the query. For example, if the query is car and several car documents are taken from a cluster of automobile documents, then we can add documents from this cluster that use terms other than car (automobile, vehicle etc). This can increase recall since a group of documents with high mutual similarity is often relevant as a whole. More recently this idea has been used for language modeling. Equation 102 , page 102 , showed that to avoid sparse data problems in the language modeling approach to IR, the model of document can be interpolated with a collection model. But the collection contains many documents with terms untypical of . By replacing the collection model with a model derived from 's cluster, we get more accurate estimates of the occurrence probabilities of terms in . Clustering can also speed up search. As we saw in Section 6.3.2 ( page 6.3.2 ) search in the vector space model amounts to finding the nearest neighbors to the query. The inverted index supports fast nearest-neighbor search for the standard IR setting. However, sometimes we may not be able to use an inverted index efficiently, e.g., in latent semantic indexing (Chapter 18 ). In such cases, we could compute the similarity of the query to every document, but this is slow. The cluster hypothesis offers an alternative: Find the clusters that are closest to the query and only consider documents from these clusters. Within this much smaller set, we can compute similarities exhaustively and rank documents in the usual way. Since there are many fewer clusters than documents, finding the closest cluster is fast; and since the documents matching a query are all similar to each other, they tend to be in the same clusters. While this algorithm is inexact, the expected decrease in search quality is small. This is essentially the application of clustering that was covered in Section 7.1.6 (page 7.1.6 ). Exercises. Define two documents as similar if they have at least two proper names like Clinton or Sarkozy in common. Give an example of an information need and two documents, for which the cluster hypothesis does not hold for this notion of similarity. Make up a simple one-dimensional example (i.e. points on a line) with two clusters where the inexactness of cluster-based retrieval shows up. In your example, retrieving clusters close to the query should do worse than direct nearest neighbor search.
iir_16_2	Problem statement     objective function    The objective function is often defined in terms of similarity or distance between documents. Below, we will see that the objective in -means clustering is to minimize the average distance between documents and their centroids or, equivalently, to maximize the similarity between documents and their centroids. The discussion of similarity measures and distance metrics in Chapter 14 (page 14.1 ) also applies to this chapter. As in Chapter 14 , we use both similarity and distance to talk about relatedness between documents. For documents, the type of similarity we want is usually topic similarity or high values on the same dimensions in the vector space model. For example, documents about China have high values on dimensions like Chinese, Beijing, and Mao whereas documents about the UK tend to have high values for London, Britain and Queen. We approximate topic similarity with cosine similarity or Euclidean distance in vector space (Chapter 6 ). If we intend to capture similarity of a type other than topic, for example, similarity of language, then a different representation may be appropriate. When computing topic similarity, stop words can be safely ignored, but they are important cues for separating clusters of English (in which the occurs frequently and la infrequently) and French documents (in which the occurs infrequently and la frequently).   Subsections A note on terminology. Cardinality - the number of clusters
iir_16_2_1	Cardinality - the number of clusters  cardinality       16.3  Since our goal is to optimize an objective function, clustering is essentially a search problem. The brute force solution would be to enumerate all possible clusterings and pick the best. However, there are exponentially many partitions, so this approach is not feasible. For this reason, most flat clustering algorithms refine an initial partitioning iteratively. If the search starts at an unfavorable initial point, we may miss the global optimum. Finding a good starting point is therefore another important problem we have to solve in flat clustering.
iir_16_3	Evaluation of clustering Typical objective functions in clustering formalize the goal of attaining high intra-cluster similarity (documents within a cluster are similar) and low inter-cluster similarity (documents from different clusters are dissimilar). This is an internal criterion for the quality of a clustering. But good scores on an internal criterion do not necessarily translate into good effectiveness in an application. An alternative to internal criteria is direct evaluation in the application of interest. For search result clustering, we may want to measure the time it takes users to find an answer with different clustering algorithms. This is the most direct evaluation, but it is expensive, especially if large user studies are necessary. As a surrogate for user judgments, we can use a set of classes in an evaluation benchmark or gold standard (see Section 8.5 , page 8.5 , and Section 13.6 , page 13.6 ). The gold standard is ideally produced by human judges with a good level of inter-judge agreement (see Chapter 8 , page 8.1 ). We can then compute an external criterion that evaluates how well the clustering matches the gold standard classes. For example, we may want to say that the optimal clustering of the search results for jaguar in Figure 16.2 consists of three classes corresponding to the three senses car, animal, and operating system. In this type of evaluation, we only use the partition provided by the gold standard, not the class labels. This section introduces four external criteria of clustering quality. Purity is a simple and transparent evaluation measure. Normalized mutual information can be information-theoretically interpreted. The Rand index penalizes both false positive and false negative decisions during clustering. The F measure in addition supports differential weighting of these two types of errors.   To compute purity , each cluster is assigned to the class which is most frequent in the cluster, and then the accuracy of this assignment is measured by counting the number of correctly assigned documents and dividing by . Formally: (182)          182 We present an example of how to compute purity in Figure 16.4 . Bad clusterings have purity values close to 0, a perfect clustering has a purity of 1 . Purity is compared with the other three measures discussed in this chapter in Table 16.2 .   Table 16.2: The four external evaluation measures applied to the clustering in Figure 16.4 .   purity NMI RI lower bound 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 maximum 1 1 1 1 value for Figure 16.4 0.71 0.36 0.68 0.46   High purity is easy to achieve when the number of clusters is large - in particular, purity is 1 if each document gets its own cluster. Thus, we cannot use purity to trade off the quality of the clustering against the number of clusters. A measure that allows us to make this tradeoff is normalized mutual information or NMI : (183)    13 13.5.1  (184)   (185)          185 184 is entropy as defined in Chapter 5 (page 5.3.2 ): (186)   (187)   in Equation 184 measures the amount of information by which our knowledge about the classes increases when we are told what the clusters are. The minimum of is 0 if the clustering is random with respect to class membership. In that case, knowing that a document is in a particular cluster does not give us any new information about what its class might be. Maximum mutual information is reached for a clustering that perfectly recreates the classes - but also if clusters in are further subdivided into smaller clusters (Exercise 16.7 ). In particular, a clustering with one-document clusters has maximum MI. So MI has the same problem as purity: it does not penalize large cardinalities and thus does not formalize our bias that, other things being equal, fewer clusters are better. The normalization by the denominator in Equation 183 fixes this problem since entropy tends to increase with the number of clusters. For example, reaches its maximum for , which ensures that NMI is low for . Because NMI is normalized, we can use it to compare clusterings with different numbers of clusters. The particular form of the denominator is chosen because is a tight upper bound on (Exercise 16.7 ). Thus, NMI is always a number between 0 and 1. An alternative to this information-theoretic interpretation of clustering is to view it as a series of decisions, one for each of the pairs of documents in the collection. We want to assign two documents to the same cluster if and only if they are similar. A true positive (TP) decision assigns two similar documents to the same cluster, a true negative (TN) decision assigns two dissimilar documents to different clusters. There are two types of errors we can commit. A (FP) decision assigns two dissimilar documents to the same cluster. A (FN) decision assigns two similar documents to different clusters. The Rand index ( ) measures the percentage of decisions that are correct. That is, it is simply accuracy (Section 8.3 , page 8.3 ).     As an example, we compute RI for Figure 16.4 . We first compute . The three clusters contain 6, 6, and 5 points, respectively, so the total number of ``positives'' or pairs of documents that are in the same cluster is: (188)    (189)   and are computed similarly, resulting in the following contingency table:   Same cluster Different clusters Same class Different classes   The Rand index gives equal weight to false positives and false negatives. Separating similar documents is sometimes worse than putting pairs of dissimilar documents in the same cluster. We can use the F measure measuresperf to penalize false negatives more strongly than false positives by selecting a value , thus giving more weight to recall.            Exercises. Replace every point in Figure 16.4 with two identical copies of in the same class. (i) Is it less difficult, equally difficult or more difficult to cluster this set of 34 points as opposed to the 17 points in Figure 16.4 ? (ii) Compute purity, NMI, RI, and for the clustering with 34 points. Which measures increase and which stay the same after doubling the number of points? (iii) Given your assessment in (i) and the results in (ii), which measures are best suited to compare the quality of the two clusterings?
iir_16_4	K-means  6 6.4.4  centroid    (190)  The definition assumes that documents are represented as length-normalized vectors in a real-valued space in the familiar way. We used centroids for Rocchio classification in Chapter 14 (page 14.2 ). They play a similar role here. The ideal cluster in -means is a sphere with the centroid as its center of gravity. Ideally, the clusters should not overlap. Our desiderata for classes in Rocchio classification were the same. The difference is that we have no labeled training set in clustering for which we know which documents should be in the same cluster. A measure of how well the centroids represent the members of their clusters is the residual sum of squares or RSS , the squared distance of each vector from its centroid summed over all vectors:          (191)    objective function          seeds 16.5 16.6  17.2 17.2 We can apply one of the following termination conditions. A fixed number of iterations has been completed. This condition limits the runtime of the clustering algorithm, but in some cases the quality of the clustering will be poor because of an insufficient number of iterations. Assignment of documents to clusters (the partitioning function ) does not change between iterations. Except for cases with a bad local minimum, this produces a good clustering, but runtimes may be unacceptably long. Centroids do not change between iterations. This is equivalent to not changing (Exercise 16.4.1 ). Terminate when RSS falls below a threshold. This criterion ensures that the clustering is of a desired quality after termination. In practice, we need to combine it with a bound on the number of iterations to guarantee termination. Terminate when the decrease in RSS falls below a threshold . For small , this indicates that we are close to convergence. Again, we need to combine it with a bound on the number of iterations to prevent very long runtimes. We now show that -means converges by proving that monotonically decreases in each iteration. We will use decrease in the meaning decrease or does not change in this section. First, RSS decreases in the reassignment step since each vector is assigned to the closest centroid, so the distance it contributes to decreases. Second, it decreases in the recomputation step because the new centroid is the vector for which reaches its minimum. (192) (193)           (194)      Since there is only a finite set of possible clusterings, a monotonically decreasing algorithm will eventually arrive at a (local) minimum. Take care, however, to break ties consistently, e.g., by assigning a document to the cluster with the lowest index if there are several equidistant centroids. Otherwise, the algorithm can cycle forever in a loop of clusterings that have the same cost.   While this proves the convergence of -means, there is unfortunately no guarantee that a global minimum in the objective function will be reached. This is a particular problem if a document set contains many outliers , documents that are far from any other documents and therefore do not fit well into any cluster. Frequently, if an outlier is chosen as an initial seed, then no other vector is assigned to it during subsequent iterations. Thus, we end up with a singleton cluster (a cluster with only one document) even though there is probably a clustering with lower RSS. Figure 16.7 shows an example of a suboptimal clustering resulting from a bad choice of initial seeds. Another type of suboptimal clustering that frequently occurs is one with empty clusters (Exercise 16.7 ). Effective heuristics for seed selection include (i) excluding outliers from the seed set; (ii) trying out multiple starting points and choosing the clustering with lowest cost; and (iii) obtaining seeds from another method such as hierarchical clustering. Since deterministic hierarchical clustering methods are more predictable than -means, a hierarchical clustering of a small random sample of size (e.g., for or ) often provides good seeds (see the description of the Buckshot algorithm, Chapter 17 , page 17.8 ). Other initialization methods compute seeds that are not selected from the vectors to be clustered. A robust method that works well for a large variety of document distributions is to select (e.g., ) random vectors for each cluster and use their centroid as the seed for this cluster. See Section 16.6 for more sophisticated initializations. What is the time complexity of -means? Most of the time is spent on computing vector distances. One such operation costs . The reassignment step computes distances, so its overall complexity is . In the recomputation step, each vector gets added to a centroid once, so the complexity of this step is . For a fixed number of iterations , the overall complexity is therefore . Thus, -means is linear in all relevant factors: iterations, number of clusters, number of vectors and dimensionality of the space. This means that -means is more efficient than the hierarchical algorithms in Chapter 17 . We had to fix the number of iterations , which can be tricky in practice. But in most cases, -means quickly reaches either complete convergence or a clustering that is close to convergence. In the latter case, a few documents would switch membership if further iterations were computed, but this has a small effect on the overall quality of the clustering. There is one subtlety in the preceding argument. Even a linear algorithm can be quite slow if one of the arguments of is large, and usually is large. High dimensionality is not a problem for computing the distance between two documents. Their vectors are sparse, so that only a small fraction of the theoretically possible componentwise differences need to be computed. Centroids, however, are dense since they pool all terms that occur in any of the documents of their clusters. As a result, distance computations are time consuming in a naive implementation of -means. However, there are simple and effective heuristics for making centroid-document similarities as fast to compute as document-document similarities. Truncating centroids to the most significant terms (e.g., ) hardly decreases cluster quality while achieving a significant speedup of the reassignment step (see references in Section 16.6 ). The same efficiency problem is addressed by K-medoids , a variant of -means that computes medoids instead of centroids as cluster centers. We define the medoid of a cluster as the document vector that is closest to the centroid. Since medoids are sparse document vectors, distance computations are fast.  Estimated minimal residual sum of squares as a function of the number of clusters in -means. In this clustering of 1203 Reuters-RCV1 documents, there are two points where the curve flattens: at 4 clusters and at 9 clusters. The documents were selected from the categories China, Germany, Russia and Sports, so the clustering is closest to the Reuters classification.   Subsections Cluster cardinality in K-means
iir_16_4_1	Cluster cardinality in K-means 16.2   A naive approach would be to select the optimal value of according to the objective function, namely the value of that minimizes RSS. Defining as the minimal RSS of all clusterings with clusters, we observe that is a monotonically decreasing function in (Exercise 16.7 ), which reaches its minimum 0 for where is the number of documents. We would end up with each document being in its own cluster. Clearly, this is not an optimal clustering. A heuristic method that gets around this problem is to estimate as follows. We first perform (e.g., ) clusterings with clusters (each with a different initialization) and compute the RSS of each. Then we take the minimum of the RSS values. We denote this minimum by . Now we can inspect the values as increases and find the ``knee'' in the curve - the point where successive decreases in become noticeably smaller. There are two such points in Figure 16.8 , one at , where the gradient flattens slightly, and a clearer flattening at . This is typical: there is seldom a single best number of clusters. We still need to employ an external constraint to choose from a number of possible values of (4 and 9 in this case). A second type of criterion for cluster cardinality imposes a penalty for each new cluster - where conceptually we start with a single cluster containing all documents and then search for the optimal number of clusters by successively incrementing by one. To determine the cluster cardinality in this way, we create a generalized objective function that combines two elements: distortion , a measure of how much documents deviate from the prototype of their clusters (e.g., RSS for -means); and a measure of model complexity . We interpret a clustering here as a model of the data. Model complexity in clustering is usually the number of clusters or a function thereof. For -means, we then get this selection criterion for :     (195)       The obvious difficulty with Equation 195 is that we need to determine . Unless this is easier than determining directly, then we are back to square one. In some cases, we can choose values of that have worked well for similar data sets in the past. For example, if we periodically cluster news stories from a newswire, there is likely to be a fixed value of that gives us the right in each successive clustering. In this application, we would not be able to determine based on past experience since changes. A theoretical justification for Equation 195 is the Akaike Information Criterion or AIC, an information-theoretic measure that trades off distortion against model complexity. The general form of AIC is: (196)      For -means, the AIC can be stated as follows: (197)  197 195  To derive Equation 197 from Equation 196 observe that in -means since each element of the centroids is a parameter that can be varied independently; and that (modulo a constant) if we view the model underlying -means as a Gaussian mixture with hard assignment, uniform cluster priors and identical spherical covariance matrices (see Exercise 16.7 ). The derivation of AIC is based on a number of assumptions, e.g., that the data are . These assumptions are only approximately true for data sets in information retrieval. As a consequence, the AIC can rarely be applied without modification in text clustering. In Figure 16.8 , the dimensionality of the vector space is 50,000. Thus, dominates the smaller RSS-based term ( , not shown in the figure) and the minimum of the expression is reached for . But as we know, (corresponding to the four classes China, Germany, Russia and Sports) is a better choice than . In practice, Equation 195 is often more useful than Equation 197 - with the caveat that we need to come up with an estimate for . Exercises. Why are documents that do not use the same term for the concept car likely to end up in the same cluster in -means clustering? Two of the possible termination conditions for -means were (1) assignment does not change, (2) centroids do not change (page 16.4 ). Do these two conditions imply each other?
iir_16_5	Model-based clustering In this section, we describe a generalization of -means, the EM algorithm. It can be applied to a larger variety of document representations and distributions than -means. In -means, we attempt to find centroids that are good representatives. We can view the set of centroids as a model that generates the data. Generating a document in this model consists of first picking a centroid at random and then adding some noise. If the noise is normally distributed, this procedure will result in clusters of spherical shape. Model-based clustering assumes that the data were generated by a model and tries to recover the original model from the data. The model that we recover from the data then defines clusters and an assignment of documents to clusters. A commonly used criterion for estimating the model parameters is maximum likelihood. In -means, the quantity is proportional to the likelihood that a particular model (i.e., a set of centroids) generated the data. For -means, maximum likelihood and minimal RSS are equivalent criteria. We denote the model parameters by . In -means, . More generally, the maximum likelihood criterion is to select the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood of generating the data : (198)    This is the same approach we took in Chapter 12 (page 12.1.1 ) for language modeling and in Section 13.1 (page 13.4 ) for text classification. In text classification, we chose the class that maximizes the likelihood of generating a particular document. Here, we choose the clustering that maximizes the likelihood of generating a given set of documents. Once we have , we can compute an assignment probability for each document-cluster pair. This set of assignment probabilities defines a soft clustering. An example of a soft assignment is that a document about Chinese cars may have a fractional membership of 0.5 in each of the two clusters China and automobiles, reflecting the fact that both topics are pertinent. A hard clustering like -means cannot model this simultaneous relevance to two topics. Model-based clustering provides a framework for incorporating our knowledge about a domain. -means and the hierarchical algorithms in Chapter 17 make fairly rigid assumptions about the data. For example, clusters in -means are assumed to be spheres. Model-based clustering offers more flexibility. The clustering model can be adapted to what we know about the underlying distribution of the data, be it Bernoulli (as in the example in Table 16.3 ), Gaussian with non-spherical variance (another model that is important in document clustering) or a member of a different family. A commonly used algorithm for model-based clustering is the Expectation-Maximization algorithm or EM algorithm . EM clustering is an iterative algorithm that maximizes . EM can be applied to many different types of probabilistic modeling. We will work with a mixture of multivariate Bernoulli distributions here, the distribution we know from Section 11.3 (page 11.3 ) and Section 13.3 (page 13.3 ):     (199)               The mixture model then is:     (200)       How do we use EM to infer the parameters of the clustering from the data? That is, how do we choose parameters that maximize ? EM is similar to -means in that it alternates between an expectation step , corresponding to reassignment, and a maximization step , corresponding to recomputation of the parameters of the model. The parameters of -means are the centroids, the parameters of the instance of EM in this section are the and . The maximization step recomputes the conditional parameters and the priors as follows:      (201)        13.3 13.3 The expectation step computes the soft assignment of documents to clusters given the current parameters and :      (202)   200   13.3   (a) docID document text docID document text   1 hot chocolate cocoa beans 7 sweet sugar   2 cocoa ghana africa 8 sugar cane brazil   3 beans harvest ghana 9 sweet sugar beet   4 cocoa butter 10 sweet cake icing   5 butter truffles 11 cake black forest   6 sweet chocolate     (b) Parameter Iteration of clustering     0 1 2 3 4 5 15 25     0.50 0.45 0.53 0.57 0.58 0.54 0.45     1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.79 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.84 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.75 0.94 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00     0.50 0.52 0.66 0.91 1.00 1.00 1.00   1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.83 0.00   0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.50 0.40 0.14 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00     0.50 0.57 0.58 0.41 0.07 0.00 0.00     0.000 0.100 0.134 0.158 0.158 0.169 0.200     0.000 0.083 0.042 0.001 0.000 0.000 0.000     0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000     0.000 0.167 0.195 0.213 0.214 0.196 0.167     0.000 0.400 0.432 0.465 0.474 0.508 0.600     0.000 0.167 0.090 0.014 0.001 0.000 0.000     0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000     1.000 0.500 0.585 0.640 0.642 0.589 0.500     1.000 0.300 0.238 0.180 0.159 0.153 0.000     1.000 0.417 0.507 0.610 0.640 0.608 0.667 The EM clustering algorithm.The table shows a set of documents (a) and parameter values for selected iterations during EM clustering (b). Parameters shown are prior , soft assignment scores (both omitted for cluster 2), and lexical parameters for a few terms. The authors initially assigned document 6 to cluster 1 and document 7 to cluster 2 (iteration 0). EM converges after 25 iterations. For smoothing, the in Equation  201 were replaced with where .  We clustered a set of 11 documents into two clusters using EM in Table 16.3 . After convergence in iteration 25, the first 5 documents are assigned to cluster 1 ( ) and the last 6 to cluster 2 (). Somewhat atypically, the final assignment is a hard assignment here. EM usually converges to a soft assignment. In iteration 25, the prior for cluster 1 is because 5 of the 11 documents are in cluster 1. Some terms are quickly associated with one cluster because the initial assignment can ``spread'' to them unambiguously. For example, membership in cluster 2 spreads from document 7 to document 8 in the first iteration because they share sugar ( in iteration 1). For parameters of terms occurring in ambiguous contexts, convergence takes longer. Seed documents 6 and 7 both contain sweet. As a result, it takes 25 iterations for the term to be unambiguously associated with cluster 2. ( in iteration 25.) Finding good seeds is even more critical for EM than for -means. EM is prone to get stuck in local optima if the seeds are not chosen well. This is a general problem that also occurs in other applications of EM.Therefore, as with -means, the initial assignment of documents to clusters is often computed by a different algorithm. For example, a hard -means clustering may provide the initial assignment, which EM can then ``soften up.'' Exercises. We saw above that the time complexity of -means is . What is the time complexity of EM?
iir_16_6	References and further reading Berkhin (2006b) gives a general up-to-date survey of clustering methods with special attention to scalability. The classic reference for clustering in pattern recognition, covering both -means and EM, is (Duda et al., 2000). Rasmussen (1992) introduces clustering from an information retrieval perspective. Anderberg (1973) provides a general introduction to clustering for applications. In addition to Euclidean distance and cosine similarity , Kullback-Leibler divergence is often used in clustering as a measure of how (dis)similar documents and clusters are (Xu and Croft, 1999, Muresan and Harper, 2004, Kurland and Lee, 2004). The cluster hypothesis is due to Jardine and van Rijsbergen (1971) who state it as follows: Associations between documents convey information about the relevance of documents to requests. Croft (1978), Can and Ozkarahan (1990), Voorhees (1985a), Salton (1975), Cacheda et al. (2003), Salton (1971a), Singitham et al. (2004), Can et al. (2004) and Altingövde et al. (2008) investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of cluster-based retrieval. While some of these studies show improvements in effectiveness, efficiency or both, there is no consensus that cluster-based retrieval works well consistently across scenarios. Cluster-based language modeling was pioneered by Liu and Croft (2004). There is good evidence that clustering of search results improves user experience and search result quality (Hearst and Pedersen, 1996, Zamir and Etzioni, 1999, Käki, 2005, Toda and Kataoka, 2005, Tombros et al., 2002), although not as much as search result structuring based on carefully edited category hierarchies (Hearst, 2006). The Scatter-Gather interface for browsing collections was presented by Cutting et al. (1992). A theoretical framework for analyzing the properties of Scatter/Gather and other information seeking user interfaces is presented by Pirolli (2007). Schütze and Silverstein (1997) evaluate LSI (Chapter 18 ) and truncated representations of centroids for efficient -means clustering. The Columbia NewsBlaster system (McKeown et al., 2002), a forerunner to the now much more famous and refined Google News (http://news.google.com), used hierarchical clustering (Chapter 17 ) to give two levels of news topic granularity. See Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2000) for details, and Chen and Lin (2000) and Radev et al. (2001) for related systems. Other applications of clustering in information retrieval are duplicate detection (Yang and Callan (2006), shingling), novelty detection (see references in hclstfurther) and metadata discovery on the semantic web (Alonso et al., 2006). The discussion of external evaluation measures is partially based on Strehl (2002). Dom (2002) proposes a measure that is better motivated theoretically than NMI. is the number of bits needed to transmit class memberships assuming cluster memberships are known. The Rand index is due to Rand (1971). Hubert and Arabie (1985) propose an adjusted that ranges between and 1 and is 0 if there is only chance agreement between clusters and classes (similar to in Chapter 8 , page 8.2 ). Basu et al. (2004) argue that the three evaluation measures NMI, Rand index and F measure give very similar results. Stein et al. (2003) propose expected edge density as an internal measure and give evidence that it is a good predictor of the quality of a clustering. Kleinberg (2002) and Meila (2005) present axiomatic frameworks for comparing clusterings. Authors that are often credited with the invention of the -means algorithm include Lloyd (1982) (first distributed in 1957), Ball (1965), MacQueen (1967), and Hartigan and Wong (1979). Arthur and Vassilvitskii (2006) investigate the worst-case complexity of -means. Bradley and Fayyad (1998), Pelleg and Moore (1999) and Davidson and Satyanarayana (2003) investigate the convergence properties of -means empirically and how it depends on initial seed selection. Dhillon and Modha (2001) compare -means clusters with SVD -based clusters (Chapter 18 ). The K-medoid algorithm was presented by Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). The EM algorithm was originally introduced by Dempster et al. (1977). An in-depth treatment of EM is (McLachlan and Krishnan, 1996). See Section 18.5 (page ) for publications on latent analysis, which can also be viewed as soft clustering. AIC is due to Akaike (1974) (see also Burnham and Anderson (2002)). An alternative to AIC is BIC, which can be motivated as a Bayesian model selection procedure (Schwarz, 1978). Fraley and Raftery (1998) show how to choose an optimal number of clusters based on BIC. An application of BIC to -means is (Pelleg and Moore, 2000). Hamerly and Elkan (2003) propose an alternative to BIC that performs better in their experiments. Another influential Bayesian approach for determining the number of clusters (simultaneously with cluster assignment) is described by Cheeseman and Stutz (1996). Two methods for determining cardinality without external criteria are presented by Tibshirani et al. (2001). We only have space here for classical completely unsupervised clustering. An important current topic of research is how to use prior knowledge to guide clustering (e.g., Ji and Xu (2006)) and how to incorporate interactive feedback during clustering (e.g., Huang and Mitchell (2006)). Fayyad et al. (1998) propose an initialization for EM clustering. For algorithms that can cluster very large data sets in one scan through the data see Bradley et al. (1998). The applications in Table 16.1 all cluster documents. Other information retrieval applications cluster words (e.g., Crouch, 1988), contexts of words (e.g., Schütze and Pedersen, 1995) or words and documents simultaneously (e.g., Tishby and Slonim, 2000, Zha et al., 2001, Dhillon, 2001). Simultaneous clustering of words and documents is an example of co-clustering or biclustering .

iir_17	Hierarchical clustering Flat clustering is efficient and conceptually simple, but as we saw in Chapter 16 it has a number of drawbacks. The algorithms introduced in Chapter 16 return a flat unstructured set of clusters, require a prespecified number of clusters as input and are nondeterministic. Hierarchical clustering (or hierarchic clustering ) outputs a hierarchy, a structure that is more informative than the unstructured set of clusters returned by flat clustering.Hierarchical clustering does not require us to prespecify the number of clusters and most hierarchical algorithms that have been used in IR are deterministic. These advantages of hierarchical clustering come at the cost of lower efficiency. The most common hierarchical clustering algorithms have a complexity that is at least quadratic in the number of documents compared to the linear complexity of -means and EM (cf. Section 16.4 , page 16.4 ). This chapter first introduces agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Section 17.1 ) and presents four different agglomerative algorithms, in Sections 17.2 -17.4 , which differ in the similarity measures they employ: single-link, complete-link, group-average, and centroid similarity. We then discuss the optimality conditions of hierarchical clustering in Section 17.5 . Section 17.6 introduces top-down (or divisive) hierarchical clustering. Section 17.7 looks at labeling clusters automatically, a problem that must be solved whenever humans interact with the output of clustering. We discuss implementation issues in Section 17.8 . Section 17.9 provides pointers to further reading, including references to soft hierarchical clustering, which we do not cover in this book. There are few differences between the applications of flat and hierarchical clustering in information retrieval. In particular, hierarchical clustering is appropriate for any of the applications shown in Table 16.1 (page 16.1 ; see also Section 16.6 , page 16.6 ). In fact, the example we gave for collection clustering is hierarchical. In general, we select flat clustering when efficiency is important and hierarchical clustering when one of the potential problems of flat clustering (not enough structure, predetermined number of clusters, non-determinism) is a concern. In addition, many researchers believe that hierarchical clustering produces better clusters than flat clustering. However, there is no consensus on this issue (see references in Section 17.9 ).

iir_17_1	Hierarchical agglomerative clustering  agglomerate  hierarchical agglomerative clustering  HAC 17.6  A dendrogram of a single-link clustering of 30 documents from Reuters-RCV1. Two possible cuts of the dendrogram are shown: at 0.4 into 24 clusters and at 0.1 into 12 clusters. Before looking at specific similarity measures used in HAC in Sections 17.2 -17.4 , we first introduce a method for depicting hierarchical clusterings graphically, discuss a few key properties of HACs and present a simple algorithm for computing an HAC. An HAC clustering is typically visualized as a dendrogram as shown in Figure 17.1 . Each merge is represented by a horizontal line. The y-coordinate of the horizontal line is the similarity of the two clusters that were merged, where documents are viewed as singleton clusters. We call this similarity the combination similarity of the merged cluster. For example, the combination similarity of the cluster consisting of Lloyd's CEO questioned and Lloyd's chief / U.S. grilling in Figure 17.1 is . We define the combination similarity of a singleton cluster as its document's self-similarity (which is 1.0 for cosine similarity). By moving up from the bottom layer to the top node, a dendrogram allows us to reconstruct the history of merges that resulted in the depicted clustering. For example, we see that the two documents entitled War hero Colin Powell were merged first in Figure 17.1 and that the last merge added Ag trade reform to a cluster consisting of the other 29 documents. A fundamental assumption in HAC is that the merge operation is monotonic . Monotonic means that if are the combination similarities of the successive merges of an HAC, then holds. A non-monotonic hierarchical clustering contains at least one inversion and contradicts the fundamental assumption that we chose the best merge available at each step. We will see an example of an inversion in Figure 17.12 . Hierarchical clustering does not require a prespecified number of clusters. However, in some applications we want a partition of disjoint clusters just as in flat clustering. In those cases, the hierarchy needs to be cut at some point. A number of criteria can be used to determine the cutting point: Cut at a prespecified level of similarity. For example, we cut the dendrogram at 0.4 if we want clusters with a minimum combination similarity of 0.4. In Figure 17.1 , cutting the diagram at yields 24 clusters (grouping only documents with high similarity together) and cutting it at yields 12 clusters (one large financial news cluster and 11 smaller clusters). Cut the dendrogram where the gap between two successive combination similarities is largest. Such large gaps arguably indicate ``natural'' clusterings. Adding one more cluster decreases the quality of the clustering significantly, so cutting before this steep decrease occurs is desirable. This strategy is analogous to looking for the knee in the -means graph in Figure 16.8 (page 16.8 ). Apply Equation 195 (page 16.4.1 ): where refers to the cut of the hierarchy that results in clusters, RSS is the residual sum of squares and is a penalty for each additional cluster. Instead of RSS, another measure of distortion can be used. As in flat clustering, we can also prespecify the number of clusters and select the cutting point that produces clusters.  Figure 17.2: A simple, but inefficient HAC algorithm.   A simple, naive HAC algorithm is shown in Figure 17.2 . We first compute the similarity matrix . The algorithm then executes steps of merging the currently most similar clusters. In each iteration, the two most similar clusters are merged and the rows and columns of the merged cluster in are updated.The clustering is stored as a list of merges in . indicates which clusters are still available to be merged. The function SIM computes the similarity of cluster with the merge of clusters and . For some HAC algorithms, SIM is simply a function of and , for example, the maximum of these two values for single-link. We will now refine this algorithm for the different similarity measures of single-link and complete-link clustering (Section 17.2 ) and group-average and centroid clustering ( and 17.4 ). The merge criteria of these four variants of HAC are shown in Figure 17.3 .
iir_17_10	Exercises Exercises. A single-link clustering can also be computed from the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The minimum spanning tree connects the vertices of a graph at the smallest possible cost, where cost is defined as the sum over all edges of the graph. In our case the cost of an edge is the distance between two documents. Show that if are the costs of the edges of a minimum spanning tree, then these edges correspond to the merges in constructing a single-link clustering. Show that single-link clustering is best-merge persistent and that GAAC and centroid clustering are not best-merge persistent.

iir_17_2	Single-link and complete-link clustering In single-link clustering or single-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most similar members (see Figure 17.3 , (a)). This single-link merge criterion is local. We pay attention solely to the area where the two clusters come closest to each other. Other, more distant parts of the cluster and the clusters' overall structure are not taken into account. In complete-link clustering or complete-linkage clustering , the similarity of two clusters is the similarity of their most dissimilar members (see Figure 17.3 , (b)). This is equivalent to choosing the cluster pair whose merge has the smallest diameter. This complete-link merge criterion is non-local; the entire structure of the clustering can influence merge decisions. This results in a preference for compact clusters with small diameters over long, straggly clusters, but also causes sensitivity to outliers. A single document far from the center can increase diameters of candidate merge clusters dramatically and completely change the final clustering.  A dendrogram of a complete-link clustering.The same 30 documents were clustered with single-link clustering in Figure 17.1 . Figure 17.4 depicts a single-link and a complete-link clustering of eight documents. The first four steps, each producing a cluster consisting of a pair of two documents, are identical. Then single-link clustering joins the upper two pairs (and after that the lower two pairs) because on the maximum-similarity definition of cluster similarity, those two clusters are closest. Complete-link clustering joins the left two pairs (and then the right two pairs) because those are the closest pairs according to the minimum-similarity definition of cluster similarity. Figure 17.1 is an example of a single-link clustering of a set of documents and Figure 17.5 is the complete-link clustering of the same set. When cutting the last merge in Figure 17.5 , we obtain two clusters of similar size (documents 1-16, from NYSE closing averages to Lloyd's chief / U.S. grilling, and documents 17-30, from Ohio Blue Cross to Clinton signs law). There is no cut of the dendrogram in Figure 17.1 that would give us an equally balanced clustering. Both single-link and complete-link clustering have graph-theoretic interpretations. Define to be the combination similarity of the two clusters merged in step , and the graph that links all data points with a similarity of at least . Then the clusters after step in single-link clustering are the connected components of and the clusters after step in complete-link clustering are maximal cliques of . A connected component is a maximal set of connected points such that there is a path connecting each pair. A clique is a set of points that are completely linked with each other. These graph-theoretic interpretations motivate the terms single-link and complete-link clustering. Single-link clusters at step are maximal sets of points that are linked via at least one link (a single link) of similarity ; complete-link clusters at step are maximal sets of points that are completely linked with each other via links of similarity .   Single-link and complete-link clustering reduce the assessment of cluster quality to a single similarity between a pair of documents: the two most similar documents in single-link clustering and the two most dissimilar documents in complete-link clustering. A measurement based on one pair cannot fully reflect the distribution of documents in a cluster. It is therefore not surprising that both algorithms often produce undesirable clusters. Single-link clustering can produce straggling clusters as shown in Figure 17.6 . Since the merge criterion is strictly local, a chain of points can be extended for long distances without regard to the overall shape of the emerging cluster. This effect is called chaining . The chaining effect is also apparent in Figure 17.1 . The last eleven merges of the single-link clustering (those above the line) add on single documents or pairs of documents, corresponding to a chain. The complete-link clustering in Figure 17.5 avoids this problem. Documents are split into two groups of roughly equal size when we cut the dendrogram at the last merge. In general, this is a more useful organization of the data than a clustering with chains.   However, complete-link clustering suffers from a different problem. It pays too much attention to outliers, points that do not fit well into the global structure of the cluster. In the example in Figure 17.7 the four documents are split because of the outlier at the left edge (Exercise 17.2.1 ). Complete-link clustering does not find the most intuitive cluster structure in this example.   Subsections Time complexity of HAC
iir_17_2_1	Time complexity of HAC The complexity of the naive HAC algorithm in Figure 17.2 is because we exhaustively scan the matrix for the largest similarity in each of iterations.   For the four HAC methods discussed in this chapter a more efficient algorithm is the priority-queue algorithm shown in Figure 17.8 . Its time complexity is . The rows of the similarity matrix are sorted in decreasing order of similarity in the priority queues . then returns the cluster in that currently has the highest similarity with , where we use to denote the cluster as in Chapter 16 . After creating the merged cluster of and , is used as its representative. The function SIM computes the similarity function for potential merge pairs: largest similarity for single-link, smallest similarity for complete-link, average similarity for GAAC (Section 17.3 ), and centroid similarity for centroid clustering (Section 17.4 ). We give an example of how a row of is processed (Figure 17.8 , bottom panel). The loop in lines 1-7 is and the loop in lines 9-21 is for an implementation of priority queues that supports deletion and insertion in . The overall complexity of the algorithm is therefore . In the definition of the function SIM, and are the vector sums of and , respectively, and and are the number of documents in and , respectively. The argument of EFFICIENTHAC in Figure 17.8 is a set of vectors (as opposed to a set of generic documents) because GAAC and centroid clustering ( and 17.4 ) require vectors as input. The complete-link version of EFFICIENTHAC can also be applied to documents that are not represented as vectors.   For single-link, we can introduce a next-best-merge array (NBM) as a further optimization as shown in Figure 17.9 . NBM keeps track of what the best merge is for each cluster. Each of the two top level for-loops in Figure 17.9 are , thus the overall complexity of single-link clustering is . Can we also speed up the other three HAC algorithms with an NBM array? We cannot because only single-link clustering is best-merge persistent . Suppose that the best merge cluster for is in single-link clustering. Then after merging with a third cluster , the merge of and will be 's best merge cluster (Exercise 17.10 ). In other words, the best-merge candidate for the merged cluster is one of the two best-merge candidates of its components in single-link clustering. This means that can be updated in in each iteration - by taking a simple max of two values on line 14 in Figure 17.9 for each of the remaining clusters.   Figure 17.10 demonstrates that best-merge persistence does not hold for complete-link clustering, which means that we cannot use an NBM array to speed up clustering. After merging 's best merge candidate with cluster , an unrelated cluster becomes the best merge candidate for . This is because the complete-link merge criterion is non-local and can be affected by points at a great distance from the area where two merge candidates meet. In practice, the efficiency penalty of the algorithm is small compared with the single-link algorithm since computing the similarity between two documents (e.g., as a dot product) is an order of magnitude slower than comparing two scalars in sorting. All four HAC algorithms in this chapter are with respect to similarity computations. So the difference in complexity is rarely a concern in practice when choosing one of the algorithms. Exercises. Show that complete-link clustering creates the two-cluster clustering depicted in Figure 17.7 .
iir_17_3	Group-average agglomerative clustering Group-average agglomerative clustering  GAAC 17.3 all  group-average clustering  average-link clustering SIM-GA  (203)         The motivation for GAAC is that our goal in selecting two clusters and as the next merge in HAC is that the resulting merge cluster should be coherent. To judge the coherence of , we need to look at all document-document similarities within , including those that occur within and those that occur within . We can compute the measure SIM-GA efficiently because the sum of individual vector similarities is equal to the similarities of their sums:     (204)    (205)         SIM FFICIENT 17.8 205 Equation 204 relies on the distributivity of the dot product with respect to vector addition. Since this is crucial for the efficient computation of a GAAC clustering, the method cannot be easily applied to representations of documents that are not real-valued vectors. Also, Equation 204 only holds for the dot product. While many algorithms introduced in this book have near-equivalent descriptions in terms of dot product, cosine similarity and Euclidean distance (cf. simdisfigs), Equation 204 can only be expressed using the dot product. This is a fundamental difference between single-link/complete-link clustering and GAAC. The first two only require a square matrix of similarities as input and do not care how these similarities were computed. To summarize, GAAC requires (i) documents represented as vectors, (ii) length normalization of vectors, so that self-similarities are 1.0, and (iii) the dot product as the measure of similarity between vectors and sums of vectors. The merge algorithms for GAAC and complete-link clustering are the same except that we use Equation 205 as similarity function in Figure 17.8 . Therefore, the overall time complexity of GAAC is the same as for complete-link clustering: . Like complete-link clustering, GAAC is not best-merge persistent (Exercise 17.10 ). This means that there is no algorithm for GAAC that would be analogous to the algorithm for single-link in Figure 17.9 . We can also define group-average similarity as including self-similarities:     (206)    139 139   Self-similarities are always equal to 1.0, the maximum possible value for length-normalized vectors. The proportion of self-similarities in Equation 206 is for a cluster of size . This gives an unfair advantage to small clusters since they will have proportionally more self-similarities. For two documents , with a similarity , we have . In contrast, . This similarity of two documents is the same as in single-link, complete-link and centroid clustering. We prefer the definition in Equation 205, which excludes self-similarities from the average, because we do not want to penalize large clusters for their smaller proportion of self-similarities and because we want a consistent similarity value for document pairs in all four HAC algorithms. Exercises. Apply group-average clustering to the points in and 17.7 . Map them onto the surface of the unit sphere in a three-dimensional space to get length-normalized vectors. Is the group-average clustering different from the single-link and complete-link clusterings?
iir_17_4	Centroid clustering   (207)   (208)   (209)   207 209 different 17.3 17.3 Figure 17.11 shows the first three steps of a centroid clustering. The first two iterations form the clusters with centroid and with centroid because the pairs and have the highest centroid similarities. In the third iteration, the highest centroid similarity is between and producing the cluster with centroid . Like GAAC, centroid clustering is not best-merge persistent and therefore (Exercise 17.10 ).   In contrast to the other three HAC algorithms, centroid clustering is not monotonic. So-called inversions can occur: Similarity can increase during clustering as in the example in Figure 17.12 , where we define similarity as negative distance. In the first merge, the similarity of and is . In the second merge, the similarity of the centroid of and (the circle) and is . This is an example of an inversion: similarity increases in this sequence of two clustering steps. In a monotonic HAC algorithm, similarity is monotonically decreasing from iteration to iteration. Increasing similarity in a series of HAC clustering steps contradicts the fundamental assumption that small clusters are more coherent than large clusters. An inversion in a dendrogram shows up as a horizontal merge line that is lower than the previous merge line. All merge lines in and 17.5 are higher than their predecessors because single-link and complete-link clustering are monotonic clustering algorithms. Despite its non-monotonicity, centroid clustering is often used because its similarity measure - the similarity of two centroids - is conceptually simpler than the average of all pairwise similarities in GAAC. Figure 17.11 is all one needs to understand centroid clustering. There is no equally simple graph that would explain how GAAC works. Exercises. For a fixed set of documents there are up to distinct similarities between clusters in single-link and complete-link clustering. How many distinct cluster similarities are there in GAAC and centroid clustering?
iir_17_5	Optimality of HAC To state the optimality conditions of hierarchical clustering precisely, we first define the combination similarity COMB-SIM of a clustering as the smallest combination similarity of any of its clusters: (210)       17.1 We then define to be optimal if all clusterings with clusters, , have lower combination similarities: (211)  Figure 17.12 shows that centroid clustering is not optimal. The clustering (for ) has combination similarity and (for ) has combination similarity -3.46. So the clustering produced in the first merge is not optimal since there is a clustering with fewer clusters ( ) that has higher combination similarity. Centroid clustering is not optimal because inversions can occur. The above definition of optimality would be of limited use if it was only applicable to a clustering together with its merge history. However, we can show (Exercise 17.5 ) that for the three non-inversion algorithms can be read off from the cluster without knowing its history. These direct definitions of combination similarity are as follows. single-link The combination similarity of a cluster is the smallest similarity of any bipartition of the cluster, where the similarity of a bipartition is the largest similarity between any two documents from the two parts: (212) where each is a bipartition of . complete-link The combination similarity of a cluster is the smallest similarity of any two points in : . GAAC The combination similarity of a cluster is the average of all pairwise similarities in (where self-similarities are not included in the average): Equation  205. We can now prove the optimality of single-link clustering by induction over the number of clusters . We will give a proof for the case where no two pairs of documents have the same similarity, but it can easily be extended to the case with ties. The inductive basis of the proof is that a clustering with clusters has combination similarity 1.0, which is the largest value possible. The induction hypothesis is that a single-link clustering with clusters is optimal: for all . Assume for contradiction that the clustering we obtain by merging the two most similar clusters in is not optimal and that instead a different sequence of merges leads to the optimal clustering with clusters. We can write the assumption that is optimal and that is not as . Case 1: The two documents linked by are in the same cluster in . They can only be in the same cluster if a merge with similarity smaller than has occurred in the merge sequence producing . This implies . Thus, . Contradiction. Case 2: The two documents linked by are not in the same cluster in . But , so the single-link merging rule should have merged these two clusters when processing . Contradiction. Thus, is optimal. In contrast to single-link clustering, complete-link clustering and GAAC are not optimal as this example shows:  Both algorithms merge the two points with distance 1 ( and ) first and thus cannot find the two-cluster clustering . But is optimal on the optimality criteria of complete-link clustering and GAAC. However, the merge criteria of complete-link clustering and GAAC approximate the desideratum of approximate sphericity better than the merge criterion of single-link clustering. In many applications, we want spherical clusters. Thus, even though single-link clustering may seem preferable at first because of its optimality, it is optimal with respect to the wrong criterion in many document clustering applications.   Table 17.1: Comparison of HAC algorithms. method combination similarity time compl. optimal? comment single-link max inter-similarity of any 2 docs yes chaining effect complete-link min inter-similarity of any 2 docs no sensitive to outliers group-average average of all sims no best choice for most applications centroid average inter-similarity no inversions can occur   Table 17.1 summarizes the properties of the four HAC algorithms introduced in this chapter. We recommend GAAC for document clustering because it is generally the method that produces the clustering with the best properties for applications. It does not suffer from chaining, from sensitivity to outliers and from inversions. There are two exceptions to this recommendation. First, for non-vector representations, GAAC is not applicable and clustering should typically be performed with the complete-link method. Second, in some applications the purpose of clustering is not to create a complete hierarchy or exhaustive partition of the entire document set. For instance, first story detection or novelty detection is the task of detecting the first occurrence of an event in a stream of news stories. One approach to this task is to find a tight cluster within the documents that were sent across the wire in a short period of time and are dissimilar from all previous documents. For example, the documents sent over the wire in the minutes after the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001 form such a cluster. Variations of single-link clustering can do well on this task since it is the structure of small parts of the vector space - and not global structure - that is important in this case. Similarly, we will describe an approach to duplicate detection on the web in Section 19.6 (page 19.6 ) where single-link clustering is used in the guise of the union-find algorithm . Again, the decision whether a group of documents are duplicates of each other is not influenced by documents that are located far away and single-link clustering is a good choice for duplicate detection. Exercises. Show the equivalence of the two definitions of combination similarity: the process definition on page 17.1 and the static definition on page 17.5 .
iir_17_6	Divisive clustering  top-down clustering  divisive clustering Top-down clustering is conceptually more complex than bottom-up clustering since we need a second, flat clustering algorithm as a ``subroutine''. It has the advantage of being more efficient if we do not generate a complete hierarchy all the way down to individual document leaves. For a fixed number of top levels, using an efficient flat algorithm like -means, top-down algorithms are linear in the number of documents and clusters. So they run much faster than HAC algorithms, which are at least quadratic. There is evidence that divisive algorithms produce more accurate hierarchies than bottom-up algorithms in some circumstances. See the references on bisecting -means in Section 17.9 . Bottom-up methods make clustering decisions based on local patterns without initially taking into account the global distribution. These early decisions cannot be undone. Top-down clustering benefits from complete information about the global distribution when making top-level partitioning decisions.
iir_17_7	Cluster labeling In many applications of flat clustering and hierarchical clustering, particularly in analysis tasks and in user interfaces (see applications in Table 16.1 , page 16.1 ), human users interact with clusters. In such settings, we must label clusters, so that users can see what a cluster is about. Differential cluster labeling selects cluster labels by comparing the distribution of terms in one cluster with that of other clusters. The feature selection methods we introduced in Section 13.5 (page ) can all be used for differential cluster labeling. In particular, mutual information (MI) (Section 13.5.1 , page 13.5.1 ) or, equivalently, information gain and the -test (Section 13.5.2 , page 13.5.2 ) will identify cluster labels that characterize one cluster in contrast to other clusters. A combination of a differential test with a penalty for rare terms often gives the best labeling results because rare terms are not necessarily representative of the cluster as a whole.       labeling method   # docs centroid mutual information title 4 622 oil plant mexico production crude power 000 refinery gas bpd plant oil production barrels crude bpd mexico dolly capacity petroleum MEXICO: Hurricane Dolly heads for Mexico coast 9 1017 police security russian people military peace killed told grozny court police killed military security peace told troops forces rebels people RUSSIA: Russia's Lebed meets rebel chief in Chechnya 10 1259 00 000 tonnes traders futures wheat prices cents september tonne delivery traders futures tonne tonnes desk wheat prices 000 00 USA: Export Business - Grain/oilseeds complex Automatically computed cluster labels.This is for three of ten clusters (4, 9, and 10) in a -means clustering of the first 10,000 documents in Reuters-RCV1. The last three columns show cluster summaries computed by three labeling methods: most highly weighted terms in centroid (centroid), mutual information, and the title of the document closest to the centroid of the cluster (title). Terms selected by only one of the first two methods are in bold.  We apply three labeling methods to a -means clustering in Table 17.2 . In this example, there is almost no difference between MI and . We therefore omit the latter. Cluster-internal labeling computes a label that solely depends on the cluster itself, not on other clusters. Labeling a cluster with the title of the document closest to the centroid is one cluster-internal method. Titles are easier to read than a list of terms. A full title can also contain important context that didn't make it into the top 10 terms selected by MI. On the web, anchor text can play a role similar to a title since the anchor text pointing to a page can serve as a concise summary of its contents. In Table 17.2 , the title for cluster 9 suggests that many of its documents are about the Chechnya conflict, a fact the MI terms do not reveal. However, a single document is unlikely to be representative of all documents in a cluster. An example is cluster 4, whose selected title is misleading. The main topic of the cluster is oil. Articles about hurricane Dolly only ended up in this cluster because of its effect on oil prices. We can also use a list of terms with high weights in the centroid of the cluster as a label. Such highly weighted terms (or, even better, phrases, especially noun phrases) are often more representative of the cluster than a few titles can be, even if they are not filtered for distinctiveness as in the differential methods. However, a list of phrases takes more time to digest for users than a well crafted title. Cluster-internal methods are efficient, but they fail to distinguish terms that are frequent in the collection as a whole from those that are frequent only in the cluster. Terms like year or Tuesday may be among the most frequent in a cluster, but they are not helpful in understanding the contents of a cluster with a specific topic like oil. In Table 17.2 , the centroid method selects a few more uninformative terms (000, court, cents, september) than MI (forces, desk), but most of the terms selected by either method are good descriptors. We get a good sense of the documents in a cluster from scanning the selected terms. For hierarchical clustering, additional complications arise in cluster labeling. Not only do we need to distinguish an internal node in the tree from its siblings, but also from its parent and its children. Documents in child nodes are by definition also members of their parent node, so we cannot use a naive differential method to find labels that distinguish the parent from its children. However, more complex criteria, based on a combination of overall collection frequency and prevalence in a given cluster, can determine whether a term is a more informative label for a child node or a parent node (see Section 17.9 ).
iir_17_8	Implementation notes In low dimensions, more aggressive optimizations are possible that make the computation of most pairwise similarities unnecessary (Exercise 17.10 ). However, no such algorithms are known in higher dimensions. We encountered the same problem in kNN classification (see Section 14.7 , page 14.7 ). When using GAAC on a large document set in high dimensions, we have to take care to avoid dense centroids. For dense centroids, clustering can take time where is the size of the vocabulary, whereas complete-link clustering is where is the average size of the vocabulary of a document. So for large vocabularies complete-link clustering can be more efficient than an unoptimized implementation of GAAC. We discussed this problem in the context of -means clustering in Chapter 16 (page 16.4 ) and suggested two solutions: truncating centroids (keeping only highly weighted terms) and representing clusters by means of sparse medoids instead of dense centroids. These optimizations can also be applied to GAAC and centroid clustering. Even with these optimizations, HAC algorithms are all or and therefore infeasible for large sets of 1,000,000 or more documents. For such large sets, HAC can only be used in combination with a flat clustering algorithm like -means. Recall that -means requires a set of seeds as initialization (Figure 16.5 , page 16.5 ). If these seeds are badly chosen, then the resulting clustering will be of poor quality. We can employ an HAC algorithm to compute seeds of high quality. If the HAC algorithm is applied to a document subset of size , then the overall runtime of -means cum HAC seed generation is . This is because the application of a quadratic algorithm to a sample of size has an overall complexity of . An appropriate adjustment can be made for an algorithm to guarantee linearity. This algorithm is referred to as the Buckshot algorithm . It combines the determinism and higher reliability of HAC with the efficiency of -means.
iir_17_9	References and further reading An excellent general review of clustering is (Jain et al., 1999). Early references for specific HAC algorithms are (King, 1967) (single-link), (Sneath and Sokal, 1973) (complete-link, GAAC) and (Lance and Williams, 1967) (discussing a large variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms). The single-link algorithm in Figure 17.9 is similar to Kruskal's algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree. A graph-theoretical proof of the correctness of Kruskal's algorithm (which is analogous to the proof in Section 17.5 ) is provided by Cormen et al. (1990, Theorem 23.1). See Exercise 17.10 for the connection between minimum spanning trees and single-link clusterings. It is often claimed that hierarchical clustering algorithms produce better clusterings than flat algorithms (Jain and Dubes (1988, p. 140), Cutting et al. (1992), Larsen and Aone (1999)) although more recently there have been experimental results suggesting the opposite (Zhao and Karypis, 2002). Even without a consensus on average behavior, there is no doubt that results of EM and -means are highly variable since they will often converge to a local optimum of poor quality. The HAC algorithms we have presented here are deterministic and thus more predictable. The complexity of complete-link, group-average and centroid clustering is sometimes given as (Day and Edelsbrunner, 1984, Murtagh, 1983, Voorhees, 1985b) because a document similarity computation is an order of magnitude more expensive than a simple comparison, the main operation executed in the merging steps after the similarity matrix has been computed. The centroid algorithm described here is due to Voorhees (1985b). Voorhees recommends complete-link and centroid clustering over single-link for a retrieval application. The Buckshot algorithm was originally published by Cutting et al. (1993). Allan et al. (1998) apply single-link clustering to first story detection . An important HAC technique not discussed here is Ward's method (El-Hamdouchi and Willett, 1986, Ward Jr., 1963), also called minimum variance clustering . In each step, it selects the merge with the smallest RSS (Chapter 16 , page 191 ). The merge criterion in Ward's method (a function of all individual distances from the centroid) is closely related to the merge criterion in GAAC (a function of all individual similarities to the centroid). Despite its importance for making the results of clustering useful, comparatively little work has been done on labeling clusters. Popescul and Ungar (2000) obtain good results with a combination of and collection frequency of a term. Glover et al. (2002b) use information gain for labeling clusters of web pages. Stein and zu Eissen's approach is ontology-based (2004). The more complex problem of labeling nodes in a hierarchy (which requires distinguishing more general labels for parents from more specific labels for children) is tackled by Glover et al. (2002a) and Treeratpituk and Callan (2006). Some clustering algorithms attempt to find a set of labels first and then build (often overlapping) clusters around the labels, thereby avoiding the problem of labeling altogether (Osinski and Weiss, 2005, Zamir and Etzioni, 1999, Käki, 2005). We know of no comprehensive study that compares the quality of such ``label-based'' clustering to the clustering algorithms discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 16 . In principle, work on multi-document summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995) is also applicable to cluster labeling, but multi-document summaries are usually longer than the short text fragments needed when labeling clusters (cf. snippets). Presenting clusters in a way that users can understand is a UI problem. We recommend reading (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, ch. 10) for an introduction to user interfaces in IR. An example of an efficient divisive algorithm is bisecting -means (Steinbach et al., 2000). Spectral clustering algorithms (Kannan et al., 2000, Dhillon, 2001, Zha et al., 2001, Ng et al., 2001a), including principal direction divisive partitioning (PDDP) (whose bisecting decisions are based on SVD , see Chapter 18 ) (Boley, 1998, Savaresi and Boley, 2004), are computationally more expensive than bisecting -means, but have the advantage of being deterministic. Unlike -means and EM, most hierarchical clustering algorithms do not have a probabilistic interpretation. Model-based hierarchical clustering (Kamvar et al., 2002, Vaithyanathan and Dom, 2000, Castro et al., 2004) is an exception. The evaluation methodology described in Section 16.3 (page 16.3 ) is also applicable to hierarchical clustering. Specialized evaluation measures for hierarchies are discussed by Fowlkes and Mallows (1983), Larsen and Aone (1999) and Sahoo et al. (2006). The R environment (R Development Core Team, 2005) offers good support for hierarchical clustering. The R function hclust implements single-link, complete-link, group-average, and centroid clustering; and Ward's method. Another option provided is median clustering which represents each cluster by its medoid (cf. k-medoids in Chapter 16 , page 16.4 ). Support for clustering vectors in high-dimensional spaces is provided by the software package CLUTO (http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/cluto).
iir_18	Matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing On page 6.3.1 we introduced the notion of a term-document matrix: an matrix , each of whose rows represents a term and each of whose columns represents a document in the collection. Even for a collection of modest size, the term-document matrix is likely to have several tens of thousands of rows and columns. In Section 18.1.1 we first develop a class of operations from linear algebra, known as matrix decomposition. In Section 18.2 we use a special form of matrix decomposition to construct a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix. In Section 18.3 we examine the application of such low-rank approximations to indexing and retrieving documents, a technique referred to as latent semantic indexing. While latent semantic indexing has not been established as a significant force in scoring and ranking for information retrieval, it remains an intriguing approach to clustering in a number of domains including for collections of text documents (Section 16.6 , page 16.6 ). Understanding its full potential remains an area of active research. Readers who do not require a refresher on linear algebra may skip Section 18.1 , although Example 18.1 is especially recommended as it highlights a property of eigenvalues that we exploit later in the chapter.

iir_18_1	Linear algebra review   The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in it; thus, . A square matrix all of whose off-diagonal entries are zero is called a diagonal matrix; its rank is equal to the number of non-zero diagonal entries. If all diagonal entries of such a diagonal matrix are , it is called the identity matrix of dimension and represented by . For a square matrix and a vector that is not all zeros, the values of satisfying (213)   eigenvalues    213  right eigenvector principal eigenvector. left eigenvectors     (214)    The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is obtained by rewriting Equation 213 in the form .

We now examine some further properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to set up the central idea of singular value decompositions in Section 18.2 below. First, we look at the relationship between matrix-vector multiplication and eigenvalues. Worked example.

Example 18.1 shows that even though is an arbitrary vector, the effect of multiplication by is determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of . Furthermore, it is intuitively apparent from Equation 221 that the product is relatively unaffected by terms arising from the small eigenvalues of ; in our example, since , the contribution of the third term on the right hand side of Equation 221 is small. In fact, if we were to completely ignore the contribution in Equation 221 from the third eigenvector corresponding to , then the product would be computed to be rather than the correct product which is ; these two vectors are relatively close to each other by any of various metrics one could apply (such as the length of their vector difference). This suggests that the effect of small eigenvalues (and their eigenvectors) on a matrix-vector product is small. We will carry forward this intuition when studying matrix decompositions and low-rank approximations in Section 18.2 . Before doing so, we examine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of special forms of matrices that will be of particular interest to us. For a symmetric matrix , the eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Further, if is both real and symmetric, the eigenvalues are all real. Worked example. Consider the real, symmetric matrix (222)        End worked example.   Subsections Matrix decompositions
iir_18_1_1	Matrix decompositions factored  matrix decomposition  18.3 18.2 We begin by giving two theorems on the decomposition of a square matrix into the product of three matrices of a special form. The first of these, Theorem 18.1.1, gives the basic factorization of a square real-valued matrix into three factors. The second, Theorem 18.1.1, applies to square symmetric matrices and is the basis of the singular value decomposition described in Theorem 18.2. Theorem. (Matrix diagonalization theorem) Let be a square real-valued matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors. Then there exists an eigen decomposition (223)       (224)  End theorem. To understand how Theorem 18.1.1 works, we note that has the eigenvectors of as columns (225)   (226)   (227)   (228)     We next state a closely related decomposition of a symmetric square matrix into the product of matrices derived from its eigenvectors. This will pave the way for the development of our main tool for text analysis, the singular value decomposition (Section 18.2 ). Theorem. (Symmetric diagonalization theorem) Let be a square, symmetric real-valued matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors. Then there exists a symmetric diagonal decomposition (229)        End theorem. We will build on this symmetric diagonal decomposition to build low-rank approximations to term-document matrices. Exercises. What is the rank of the diagonal matrix below? (230) Show that is an eigenvalue of (231) Find the corresponding eigenvector. Compute the unique eigen decomposition of the matrix in (222).
iir_18_2	Term-document matrices and singular value decompositions      singular value decomposition 18.3  18.2  18.1.1          Theorem. Let be the rank of the matrix . Then, there is a singular-value decomposition ( SVD for short) of of the form (232)  The eigenvalues of are the same as the eigenvalues of ; For , let , with . Then the matrix is composed by setting for , and zero otherwise. End theorem. The values are referred to as the singular values of . It is instructive to examine the relationship of Theorem 18.2 to Theorem 18.1.1; we do this rather than derive the general proof of Theorem 18.2, which is beyond the scope of this book. By multiplying Equation 232 by its transposed version, we have (233)  Note now that in Equation 233, the left-hand side is a square symmetric matrix real-valued matrix, and the right-hand side represents its symmetric diagonal decomposition as in Theorem 18.1.1. What does the left-hand side represent? It is a square matrix with a row and a column corresponding to each of the terms. The entry in the matrix is a measure of the overlap between the th and th terms, based on their co-occurrence in documents. The precise mathematical meaning depends on the manner in which is constructed based on term weighting. Consider the case where is the term-document incidence matrix of page 1.1 , illustrated in Figure 1.1 . Then the entry in is the number of documents in which both term and term occur.   When writing down the numerical values of the SVD, it is conventional to represent as an matrix with the singular values on the diagonals, since all its entries outside this sub-matrix are zeros. Accordingly, it is conventional to omit the rightmost columns of corresponding to these omitted rows of ; likewise the rightmost columns of are omitted since they correspond in to the rows that will be multiplied by the columns of zeros in . This written form of the SVD is sometimes known as the reduced SVD or truncated SVD and we will encounter it again in Exercise 18.3 . Henceforth, our numerical examples and exercises will use this reduced form. Worked example. We now illustrate the singular-value decomposition of a matrix of rank 2; the singular values are and .  (234)  End worked example. As with the matrix decompositions defined in Section 18.1.1 , the singular value decomposition of a matrix can be computed by a variety of algorithms, many of which have been publicly available software implementations; pointers to these are given in Section 18.5 . Exercises. Let (235) be the term-document incidence matrix for a collection. Compute the co-occurrence matrix . What is the interpretation of the diagonal entries of when is a term-document incidence matrix? Verify that the SVD of the matrix in Equation 235 is (236) by verifying all of the properties in the statement of Theorem 18.2. Suppose that is a binary term-document incidence matrix. What do the entries of represent? Let (237) be a term-document matrix whose entries are term frequencies; thus term 1 occurs 2 times in document 2 and once in document 3. Compute ; observe that its entries are largest where two terms have their most frequent occurrences together in the same document.
iir_18_3	Low-rank approximations We next state a matrix approximation problem that at first seems to have little to do with information retrieval. We describe a solution to this matrix problem using singular-value decompositions, then develop its application to information retrieval. Given an matrix and a positive integer , we wish to find an matrix of rank at most , so as to minimize the Frobenius norm of the matrix difference , defined to be (238)               low-rank approximation The singular value decomposition can be used to solve the low-rank matrix approximation problem. We then derive from it an application to approximating term-document matrices. We invoke the following three-step procedure to this end: Given , construct its SVD in the form shown in (232); thus, . Derive from the matrix formed by replacing by zeros the smallest singular values on the diagonal of . Compute and output as the rank- approximation to .     18.1   Theorem. (239)  End theorem. Recalling that the singular values are in decreasing order , we learn from Theorem 18.3 that is the best rank- approximation to , incurring an error (measured by the Frobenius norm of ) equal to . Thus the larger is, the smaller this error (and in particular, for , the error is zero since ; provided , then and thus ).   To derive further insight into why the process of truncating the smallest singular values in helps generate a rank- approximation of low error, we examine the form of : (240)   (241)   (242)              Exercises. Compute a rank 1 approximation to the matrix in Example 235, using the SVD as in Exercise 236. What is the Frobenius norm of the error of this approximation? Consider now the computation in Exercise 18.3 . Following the schematic in Figure 18.2 , notice that for a rank 1 approximation we have being a scalar. Denote by the first column of and by the first column of . Show that the rank-1 approximation to can then be written as . reduced can be generalized to rank approximations: we let and denote the ``reduced'' matrices formed by retaining only the first columns of and , respectively. Thus is an matrix while is a matrix. Then, we have (243) where is the square submatrix of with the singular values on the diagonal. The primary advantage of using (243) is to eliminate a lot of redundant columns of zeros in and , thereby explicitly eliminating multiplication by columns that do not affect the low-rank approximation; this version of the SVD is sometimes known as the reduced SVD or truncated SVD and is a computationally simpler representation from which to compute the low rank approximation. For the matrix in Example 18.2, write down both and .
iir_18_4	Latent semantic indexing    latent semantic indexing But first, we motivate such an approximation. Recall the vector space representation of documents and queries introduced in Section 6.3 (page ). This vector space representation enjoys a number of advantages including the uniform treatment of queries and documents as vectors, the induced score computation based on cosine similarity, the ability to weight different terms differently, and its extension beyond document retrieval to such applications as clustering and classification. The vector space representation suffers, however, from its inability to cope with two classic problems arising in natural languages: synonymy and polysemy. Synonymy refers to a case where two different words (say car and automobile) have the same meaning. Because the vector space representation fails to capture the relationship between synonymous terms such as car and automobile - according each a separate dimension in the vector space. Consequently the computed similarity between a query (say, car) and a document containing both car and automobile underestimates the true similarity that a user would perceive. Polysemy on the other hand refers to the case where a term such as charge has multiple meanings, so that the computed similarity overestimates the similarity that a user would perceive. Could we use the co-occurrences of terms (whether, for instance, charge occurs in a document containing steed versus in a document containing electron) to capture the latent semantic associations of terms and alleviate these problems? Even for a collection of modest size, the term-document matrix is likely to have several tens of thousand of rows and columns, and a rank in the tens of thousands as well. In latent semantic indexing (sometimes referred to as latent semantic analysis (LSA) ), we use the SVD to construct a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix, for a value of that is far smaller than the original rank of . In the experimental work cited later in this section, is generally chosen to be in the low hundreds. We thus map each row/column (respectively corresponding to a term/document) to a -dimensional space; this space is defined by the principal eigenvectors (corresponding to the largest eigenvalues) of and . Note that the matrix is itself still an matrix, irrespective of . Next, we use the new -dimensional LSI representation as we did the original representation - to compute similarities between vectors. A query vector is mapped into its representation in the LSI space by the transformation (244)  6.3.1  244  244 The fidelity of the approximation of to leads us to hope that the relative values of cosine similarities are preserved: if a query is close to a document in the original space, it remains relatively close in the -dimensional space. But this in itself is not sufficiently interesting, especially given that the sparse query vector turns into a dense query vector in the low-dimensional space. This has a significant computational cost, when compared with the cost of processing in its native form. Worked example. Consider the term-document matrix         ship 1 0 1 0 0 0     boat 0 1 0 0 0 0     ocean 1 1 0 0 0 0     voyage 1 0 0 1 1 0     trip 0 0 0 1 0 1   Its singular value decomposition is the product of three matrices as below. First we have which in this example is:     1 2 3 4 5     ship     boat 0.00 0.73     ocean 0.00     voyage 0.35 0.15 0.16     trip 0.65 0.58   When applying the SVD to a term-document matrix, is known as the SVD term matrix. The singular values are 2.16 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.59 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.28 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.39 Finally we have , which in the context of a term-document matrix is known as the SVD document matrix:         1     2 0.63 0.22 0.41     3 0.28 0.45 0.12     4 0.00 0.00 0.58 0.00 0.58     5 0.29 0.63 0.19 0.41   By ``zeroing out'' all but the two largest singular values of , we obtain 2.16 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.59 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 From this, we compute         1     2 1.00 0.35 0.65     3 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     4 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00     5 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00   Notice that the low-rank approximation, unlike the original matrix , can have negative entries. End worked example. Examination of and in Example 18.4 shows that the last 3 rows of each of these matrices are populated entirely by zeros. This suggests that the SVD product in Equation 241 can be carried out with only two rows in the representations of and ; we may then replace these matrices by their truncated versions and . For instance, the truncated SVD document matrix in this example is:         1     2 1.00 0.35 0.65   Figure 18.3 illustrates the documents in in two dimensions. Note also that is dense relative to .  Figure 18.3: The documents of Example  18.4 reduced to two dimensions in . We may in general view the low-rank approximation of by as a constrained optimization problem: subject to the constraint that have rank at most , we seek a representation of the terms and documents comprising with low Frobenius norm for the error . When forced to squeeze the terms/documents down to a -dimensional space, the SVD should bring together terms with similar co-occurrences. This intuition suggests, then, that not only should retrieval quality not suffer too much from the dimension reduction, but in fact may improve. Dumais (1993) and Dumais (1995) conducted experiments with LSI on TREC documents and tasks, using the commonly-used Lanczos algorithm to compute the SVD. At the time of their work in the early 1990's, the LSI computation on tens of thousands of documents took approximately a day on one machine. On these experiments, they achieved precision at or above that of the median TREC participant. On about 20% of TREC topics their system was the top scorer, and reportedly slightly better on average than standard vector spaces for LSI at about 350 dimensions. Here are some conclusions on LSI first suggested by their work, and subsequently verified by many other experiments.  The computational cost of the SVD is significant; at the time of this writing, we know of no successful experiment with over one million documents. This has been the biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption to LSI. One approach to this obstacle is to build the LSI representation on a randomly sampled subset of the documents in the collection, following which the remaining documents are ``folded in'' as detailed with Equation 244. As we reduce , recall tends to increase, as expected. Most surprisingly, a value of in the low hundreds can actually increase precision on some query benchmarks. This appears to suggest that for a suitable value of , LSI addresses some of the challenges of synonymy. LSI works best in applications where there is little overlap between queries and documents. The experiments also documented some modes where LSI failed to match the effectiveness of more traditional indexes and score computations. Most notably (and perhaps obviously), LSI shares two basic drawbacks of vector space retrieval: there is no good way of expressing negations (find documents that contain german but not shepherd), and no way of enforcing Boolean conditions. LSI can be viewed as soft clustering by interpreting each dimension of the reduced space as a cluster and the value that a document has on that dimension as its fractional membership in that cluster.
iir_18_5	References and further reading Strang (1986) provides an excellent introductory overview of matrix decompositions including the singular value decomposition. Theorem 18.3 is due to Eckart and Young (1936). The connection between information retrieval and low-rank approximations of the term-document matrix was introduced in Deerwester et al. (1990), with a subsequent survey of results in Berry et al. (1995). Dumais (1993) and Dumais (1995) describe experiments on TREC benchmarks giving evidence that at least on some benchmarks, LSI can produce better precision and recall than standard vector-space retrieval. http://www.cs.utk.edu/~berry/lsi++/and http://lsi.argreenhouse.com/lsi/LSIpapers.htmloffer comprehensive pointers to the literature and software of LSI. Schütze and Silverstein (1997) evaluate LSI and truncated representations of centroids for efficient -means clustering (Section 16.4 ). Bast and Majumdar (2005) detail the role of the reduced dimension in LSI and how different pairs of terms get coalesced together at differing values of . Applications of LSI to cross-language information retrieval (where documents in two or more different languages are indexed, and a query posed in one language is expected to retrieve documents in other languages) are developed in Berry and Young (1995) and Littman et al. (1998). LSI (referred to as LSA in more general settings) has been applied to host of other problems in computer science ranging from memory modeling to computer vision. Hofmann (1999a;b) provides an initial probabilistic extension of the basic latent semantic indexing technique. A more satisfactory formal basis for a probabilistic latent variable model for dimensionality reduction is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) model (Blei et al., 2003), which is generative and assigns probabilities to documents outside of the training set. This model is extended to a hierarchical clustering by Rosen-Zvi et al. (2004). Wei and Croft (2006) present the first large scale evaluation of LDA, finding it to significantly outperform the query likelihood model of Section 12.2 (page ), but to not perform quite as well as the relevance model mentioned in Section 12.4 (page ) - but the latter does additional per-query processing unlike LDA. Teh et al. (2006) generalize further by presenting Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes , a probabilistic model which allows a group (for us, a document) to be drawn from an infinite mixture of latent topics, while still allowing these topics to be shared across documents.

iir_19_1	Background and history The invention of hypertext, envisioned by Vannevar Bush in the 1940's and first realized in working systems in the 1970's, significantly precedes the formation of the World Wide Web (which we will simply refer to as the Web), in the 1990's. Web usage has shown tremendous growth to the point where it now claims a good fraction of humanity as participants, by relying on a simple, open client-server design: (1) the server communicates with the client via a protocol (the http or hypertext transfer protocol) that is lightweight and simple, asynchronously carrying a variety of payloads (text, images and - over time - richer media such as audio and video files) encoded in a simple markup language called HTML (for hypertext markup language); (2) the client - generally a browser, an application within a graphical user environment - can ignore what it does not understand. Each of these seemingly innocuous features has contributed enormously to the growth of the Web, so it is worthwhile to examine them further. The basic operation is as follows: a client (such as a browser) sends an http request to a web server. The browser specifies a URL (for Uniform Resource Locator) such as http://www.stanford.edu/home/atoz/contact.html. In this example URL, the string http refers to the protocol to be used for transmitting the data. The string www.stanford.edu is known as the domain and specifies the root of a hierarchy of web pages (typically mirroring a filesystem hierarchy underlying the web server). In this example, /home/atoz/contact.html is a path in this hierarchy with a file contact.html that contains the information to be returned by the web server at www.stanford.edu in response to this request. The HTML-encoded file contact.html holds the hyperlinks and the content (in this instance, contact information for Stanford University), as well as formatting rules for rendering this content in a browser. Such an http request thus allows us to fetch the content of a page, something that will prove to be useful to us for crawling and indexing documents (Chapter 20 ). The designers of the first browsers made it easy to view the HTML markup tags on the content of a URL. This simple convenience allowed new users to create their own HTML content without extensive training or experience; rather, they learned from example content that they liked. As they did so, a second feature of browsers supported the rapid proliferation of web content creation and usage: browsers ignored what they did not understand. This did not, as one might fear, lead to the creation of numerous incompatible dialects of HTML. What it did promote was amateur content creators who could freely experiment with and learn from their newly created web pages without fear that a simple syntax error would ``bring the system down.'' Publishing on the Web became a mass activity that was not limited to a few trained programmers, but rather open to tens and eventually hundreds of millions of individuals. For most users and for most information needs, the Web quickly became the best way to supply and consume information on everything from rare ailments to subway schedules. The mass publishing of information on the Web is essentially useless unless this wealth of information can be discovered and consumed by other users. Early attempts at making web information ``discoverable'' fell into two broad categories: (1) full-text index search engines such as Altavista, Excite and Infoseek and (2) taxonomies populated with web pages in categories, such as Yahoo! The former presented the user with a keyword search interface supported by inverted indexes and ranking mechanisms building on those introduced in earlier chapters. The latter allowed the user to browse through a hierarchical tree of category labels. While this is at first blush a convenient and intuitive metaphor for finding web pages, it has a number of drawbacks: first, accurately classifying web pages into taxonomy tree nodes is for the most part a manual editorial process, which is difficult to scale with the size of the Web. Arguably, we only need to have ``high-quality'' web pages in the taxonomy, with only the best web pages for each category. However, just discovering these and classifying them accurately and consistently into the taxonomy entails significant human effort. Furthermore, in order for a user to effectively discover web pages classified into the nodes of the taxonomy tree, the user's idea of what sub-tree(s) to seek for a particular topic should match that of the editors performing the classification. This quickly becomes challenging as the size of the taxonomy grows; the Yahoo! taxonomy tree surpassed 1000 distinct nodes fairly early on. Given these challenges, the popularity of taxonomies declined over time, even though variants (such as About.com and the Open Directory Project) sprang up with subject-matter experts collecting and annotating web pages for each category. The first generation of web search engines transported classical search techniques such as those in the preceding chapters to the web domain, focusing on the challenge of scale. The earliest web search engines had to contend with indexes containing tens of millions of documents, which was a few orders of magnitude larger than any prior information retrieval system in the public domain. Indexing, query serving and ranking at this scale required the harnessing together of tens of machines to create highly available systems, again at scales not witnessed hitherto in a consumer-facing search application. The first generation of web search engines was largely successful at solving these challenges while continually indexing a significant fraction of the Web, all the while serving queries with sub-second response times. However, the quality and relevance of web search results left much to be desired owing to the idiosyncrasies of content creation on the Web that we discuss in Section 19.2 . This necessitated the invention of new ranking and spam-fighting techniques in order to ensure the quality of the search results. While classical information retrieval techniques (such as those covered earlier in this book) continue to be necessary for web search, they are not by any means sufficient. A key aspect (developed further in Chapter 21 ) is that whereas classical techniques measure the relevance of a document to a query, there remains a need to gauge the authoritativeness of a document based on cues such as which website hosts it.
iir_19_2	Web characteristics What about the substance of the text in web pages? The democratization of content creation on the web meant a new level of granularity in opinion on virtually any subject. This meant that the web contained truth, lies, contradictions and suppositions on a grand scale. This gives rise to the question: which web pages does one trust? In a simplistic approach, one might argue that some publishers are trustworthy and others not - begging the question of how a search engine is to assign such a measure of trust to each website or web page. In Chapter 21 we will examine approaches to understanding this question. More subtly, there may be no universal, user-independent notion of trust; a web page whose contents are trustworthy to one user may not be so to another. In traditional (non-web) publishing this is not an issue: users self-select sources they find trustworthy. Thus one reader may find the reporting of The New York Times to be reliable, while another may prefer The Wall Street Journal. But when a search engine is the only viable means for a user to become aware of (let alone select) most content, this challenge becomes significant. While the question ``how big is the Web?'' has no easy answer (see Section 19.5 ), the question ``how many web pages are in a search engine's index'' is more precise, although, even this question has issues. By the end of 1995, Altavista reported that it had crawled and indexed approximately 30 million static web pages . Static web pages are those whose content does not vary from one request for that page to the next. For this purpose, a professor who manually updates his home page every week is considered to have a static web page, but an airport's flight status page is considered to be dynamic. Dynamic pages are typically mechanically generated by an application server in response to a query to a database, as show in Figure 19.1 . One sign of such a page is that the URL has the character "?" in it. Since the number of static web pages was believed to be doubling every few months in 1995, early web search engines such as Altavista had to constantly add hardware and bandwidth for crawling and indexing web pages. A dynamically generated web page.The browser sends a request for flight information on flight AA129 to the web application, that fetches the information from back-end databases then creates a dynamic web page that it returns to the browser.   Subsections The web graph Spam
iir_19_2_1	The web graph  Figure 19.2: Two nodes of the web graph joined by a link. Figure 19.2 shows two nodes A and B from the web graph, each corresponding to a web page, with a hyperlink from A to B. We refer to the set of all such nodes and directed edges as the web graph. Figure 19.2 also shows that (as is the case with most links on web pages) there is some text surrounding the origin of the hyperlink on page A. This text is generally encapsulated in the href attribute of the  (for anchor) tag that encodes the hyperlink in the HTML code of page A, and is referred to as anchor text . As one might suspect, this directed graph is not strongly connected: there are pairs of pages such that one cannot proceed from one page of the pair to the other by following hyperlinks. We refer to the hyperlinks into a page as in-links and those out of a page as out-links . The number of in-links to a page (also known as its in-degree) has averaged from roughly 8 to 15, in a range of studies. We similarly define the out-degree of a web page to be the number of links out of it. These notions are represented in Figure 19.3 .  A sample small web graph.In this example we have six pages labeled A-F. Page B has in-degree 3 and out-degree 1. This example graph is not strongly connected: there is no path from any of pages B-F to page A. There is ample evidence that these links are not randomly distributed; for one thing, the distribution of the number of links into a web page does not follow the Poisson distribution one would expect if every web page were to pick the destinations of its links uniformly at random. Rather, this distribution is widely reported to be a power law , in which the total number of web pages with in-degree is proportional to ; the value of typically reported by studies is 2.1. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that the directed graph connecting web pages has a bowtie shape: there are three major categories of web pages that are sometimes referred to as IN, OUT and SCC. A web surfer can pass from any page in IN to any page in SCC, by following hyperlinks. Likewise, a surfer can pass from page in SCC to any page in OUT. Finally, the surfer can surf from any page in SCC to any other page in SCC. However, it is not possible to pass from a page in SCC to any page in IN, or from a page in OUT to a page in SCC (or, consequently, IN). Notably, in several studies IN and OUT are roughly equal in size, whereas SCC is somewhat larger; most web pages fall into one of these three sets. The remaining pages form into tubes that are small sets of pages outside SCC that lead directly from IN to OUT, and tendrils that either lead nowhere from IN, or from nowhere to OUT. Figure 19.4 illustrates this structure of the Web. The bowtie structure of the Web.Here we show one tube and three tendrils.
iir_19_2_2	Spam  spam spammers At its root, spam stems from the heterogeneity of motives in content creation on the Web. In particular, many web content creators have commercial motives and therefore stand to gain from manipulating search engine results. You might argue that this is no different from a company that uses large fonts to list its phone numbers in the yellow pages; but this generally costs the company more and is thus a fairer mechanism. A more apt analogy, perhaps, is the use of company names beginning with a long string of A's to be listed early in a yellow pages category. In fact, the yellow pages' model of companies paying for larger/darker fonts has been replicated in web search: in many search engines, it is possible to pay to have one's web page included in the search engine's index - a model known as paid inclusion . Different search engines have different policies on whether to allow paid inclusion, and whether such a payment has any effect on ranking in search results. Search engines soon became sophisticated enough in their spam detection to screen out a large number of repetitions of particular keywords. Spammers responded with a richer set of spam techniques, the best known of which we now describe. The first of these techniques is cloaking, shown in Figure 19.5 . Here, the spammer's web server returns different pages depending on whether the http request comes from a web search engine's crawler (the part of the search engine that gathers web pages, to be described in Chapter 20 ), or from a human user's browser. The former causes the web page to be indexed by the search engine under misleading keywords. When the user searches for these keywords and elects to view the page, he receives a web page that has altogether different content than that indexed by the search engine. Such deception of search indexers is unknown in the traditional world of information retrieval; it stems from the fact that the relationship between page publishers and web search engines is not completely collaborative.  Figure 19.5: Cloaking as used by spammers. A doorway page contains text and metadata carefully chosen to rank highly on selected search keywords. When a browser requests the doorway page, it is redirected to a page containing content of a more commercial nature. More complex spamming techniques involve manipulation of the metadata related to a page including (for reasons we will see in Chapter 21 ) the links into a web page. Given that spamming is inherently an economically motivated activity, there has sprung around it an industry of Search Engine Optimizers , or SEOs to provide consultancy services for clients who seek to have their web pages rank highly on selected keywords. Web search engines frown on this business of attempting to decipher and adapt to their proprietary ranking techniques and indeed announce policies on forms of SEO behavior they do not tolerate (and have been known to shut down search requests from certain SEOs for violation of these). Inevitably, the parrying between such SEOs (who gradually infer features of each web search engine's ranking methods) and the web search engines (who adapt in response) is an unending struggle; indeed, the research sub-area of adversarial information retrieval has sprung up around this battle. To combat spammers who manipulate the text of their web pages is the exploitation of the link structure of the Web - a technique known as link analysis. The first web search engine known to apply link analysis on a large scale (to be detailed in Chapter 21 ) was Google, although all web search engines currently make use of it (and correspondingly, spammers now invest considerable effort in subverting it - this is known as link spam ). Exercises. If the number of pages with in-degree is proportional to , what is the probability that a randomly chosen web page has in-degree ? If the number of pages with in-degree is proportional to , what is the average in-degree of a web page? If the number of pages with in-degree is proportional to , then as the largest in-degree goes to infinity, does the fraction of pages with in-degree grow, stay the same, or diminish? How would your answer change for values of the exponent other than ? The average in-degree of all nodes in a snapshot of the web graph is 9. What can we say about the average out-degree of all nodes in this snapshot?
iir_19_3	Advertising as the economic model branding cost per mil  CPM impressions clicked on cost per click  CPC The pioneer in this direction was a company named Goto, which changed its name to Overture prior to eventual acquisition by Yahoo! Goto was not, in the traditional sense, a search engine; rather, for every query term it accepted bids from companies who wanted their web page shown on the query . In response to the query , Goto would return the pages of all advertisers who bid for , ordered by their bids. Furthermore, when the user clicked on one of the returned results, the corresponding advertiser would make a payment to Goto (in the initial implementation, this payment equaled the advertiser's bid for ). Several aspects of Goto's model are worth highlighting. First, a user typing the query into Goto's search interface was actively expressing an interest and intent related to the query . For instance, a user typing golf clubs is more likely to be imminently purchasing a set than one who is simply browsing news on golf. Second, Goto only got compensated when a user actually expressed interest in an advertisement - as evinced by the user clicking the advertisement. Taken together, these created a powerful mechanism by which to connect advertisers to consumers, quickly raising the annual revenues of Goto/Overture into hundreds of millions of dollars. This style of search engine came to be known variously as sponsored search or search advertising . Given these two kinds of search engines - the ``pure'' search engines such as Google and Altavista, versus the sponsored search engines - the logical next step was to combine them into a single user experience. Current search engines follow precisely this model: they provide pure search results (generally known as algorithmic search results) as the primary response to a user's search, together with sponsored search results displayed separately and distinctively to the right of the algorithmic results. This is shown in Figure 19.6 . Retrieving sponsored search results and ranking them in response to a query has now become considerably more sophisticated than the simple Goto scheme; the process entails a blending of ideas from information retrieval and microeconomics, and is beyond the scope of this book. For advertisers, understanding how search engines do this ranking and how to allocate marketing campaign budgets to different keywords and to different sponsored search engines has become a profession known as search engine marketing (SEM).  Search advertising triggered by query keywords.Here the query A320 returns algorithmic search results about the Airbus aircraft, together with advertisements for various non-aircraft goods numbered A320, that advertisers seek to market to those querying on this query. The lack of advertisements for the aircraft reflects the fact that few marketers attempt to sell A320 aircraft on the web. The inherently economic motives underlying sponsored search give rise to attempts by some participants to subvert the system to their advantage. This can take many forms, one of which is known as click spam . There is currently no universally accepted definition of click spam. It refers (as the name suggests) to clicks on sponsored search results that are not from bona fide search users. For instance, a devious advertiser may attempt to exhaust the advertising budget of a competitor by clicking repeatedly (through the use of a robotic click generator) on that competitor's sponsored search advertisements. Search engines face the challenge of discerning which of the clicks they observe are part of a pattern of click spam, to avoid charging their advertiser clients for such clicks. Exercises. The Goto method ranked advertisements matching a query by bid: the highest-bidding advertiser got the top position, the second-highest the next, and so on. What can go wrong with this when the highest-bidding advertiser places an advertisement that is irrelevant to the query? Why might an advertiser with an irrelevant advertisement bid high in this manner? Suppose that, in addition to bids, we had for each advertiser their click-through rate: the ratio of the historical number of times users click on their advertisement to the number of times the advertisement was shown. Suggest a modification of the Goto scheme that exploits this data to avoid the problem in Exercise 19.3 above.
iir_19_4	The search user experience It is clear that the more user traffic a web search engine can attract, the more revenue it stands to earn from sponsored search. How do search engines differentiate themselves and grow their traffic? Here Google identified two principles that helped it grow at the expense of its competitors: (1) a focus on relevance, specifically precision rather than recall in the first few results; (2) a user experience that is lightweight, meaning that both the search query page and the search results page are uncluttered and almost entirely textual, with very few graphical elements. The effect of the first was simply to save users time in locating the information they sought. The effect of the second is to provide a user experience that is extremely responsive, or at any rate not bottlenecked by the time to load the search query or results page.  Subsections User query needs
iir_19_4_1	User query needs Informational queries seek general information on a broad topic, such as leukemia or Provence. There is typically not a single web page that contains all the information sought; indeed, users with informational queries typically try to assimilate information from multiple web pages. Navigational queries seek the website or home page of a single entity that the user has in mind, say Lufthansa airlines. In such cases, the user's expectation is that the very first search result should be the home page of Lufthansa. The user is not interested in a plethora of documents containing the term Lufthansa; for such a user, the best measure of user satisfaction is precision at 1. A transactional query is one that is a prelude to the user performing a transaction on the Web - such as purchasing a product, downloading a file or making a reservation. In such cases, the search engine should return results listing services that provide form interfaces for such transactions. Discerning which of these categories a query falls into can be challenging. The category not only governs the algorithmic search results, but the suitability of the query for sponsored search results (since the query may reveal an intent to purchase). For navigational queries, some have argued that the search engine should return only a single result or even the target web page directly. Nevertheless, web search engines have historically engaged in a battle of bragging rights over which one indexes more web pages. Does the user really care? Perhaps not, but the media does highlight estimates (often statistically indefensible) of the sizes of various search engines. Users are influenced by these reports and thus, search engines do have to pay attention to how their index sizes compare to competitors'. For informational (and to a lesser extent, transactional) queries, the user does care about the comprehensiveness of the search engine. Figure 19.7 shows a composite picture of a web search engine including the crawler, as well as both the web page and advertisement indexes. The portion of the figure under the curved dashed line is internal to the search engine.  Figure 19.7: The various components of a web search engine.
iir_19_5	Index size and estimation http://www.yahoo.com/any_string  spider traps 20 We could ask the following better-defined question: given two search engines, what are the relative sizes of their indexes? Even this question turns out to be imprecise, because: In response to queries a search engine can return web pages whose contents it has not (fully or even partially) indexed. For one thing, search engines generally index only the first few thousand words in a web page. In some cases, a search engine is aware of a page that is linked to by pages it has indexed, but has not indexed itself. As we will see in Chapter 21 , it is still possible to meaningfully return in search results. Search engines generally organize their indexes in various tiers and partitions, not all of which are examined on every search (recall tiered indexes from Section 7.2.1 ). For instance, a web page deep inside a website may be indexed but not retrieved on general web searches; it is however retrieved as a result on a search that a user has explicitly restricted to that website (such site-specific search is offered by most web search engines).   20  capture-recapture method Suppose that we could pick a random page from the index of and test whether it is in 's index and symmetrically, test whether a random page from is in . These experiments give us fractions and such that our estimate is that a fraction of the pages in are in , while a fraction of the pages in are in . Then, letting denote the size of the index of search engine , we have (245)   (246)    246   from outside the search engine To implement the sampling phase, we might generate a random page from the entire (idealized, finite) Web and test it for presence in each search engine. Unfortunately, picking a web page uniformly at random is a difficult problem. We briefly outline several attempts to achieve such a sample, pointing out the biases inherent to each; following this we describe in some detail one technique that much research has built on. Random searches: Begin with a search log of web searches; send a random search from this log to and a random page from the results. Since such logs are not widely available outside a search engine, one implementation is to trap all search queries going out of a work group (say scientists in a research center) that agrees to have all its searches logged. This approach has a number of issues, including the bias from the types of searches made by the work group. Further, a random document from the results of such a random search to is not the same as a random document from . Random IP addresses: A second approach is to generate random IP addresses and send a request to a web server residing at the random address, collecting all pages at that server. The biases here include the fact that many hosts might share one IP (due to a practice known as virtual hosting) or not accept http requests from the host where the experiment is conducted. Furthermore, this technique is more likely to hit one of the many sites with few pages, skewing the document probabilities; we may be able to correct for this effect if we understand the distribution of the number of pages on websites. Random walks: If the web graph were a strongly connected directed graph, we could run a random walk starting at an arbitrary web page. This walk would converge to a steady state distribution (see Chapter 21 , Section 21.2.1 for more background material on this), from which we could in principle pick a web page with a fixed probability. This method, too has a number of biases. First, the Web is not strongly connected so that, even with various corrective rules, it is difficult to argue that we can reach a steady state distribution starting from any page. Second, the time it takes for the random walk to settle into this steady state is unknown and could exceed the length of the experiment. Clearly each of these approaches is far from perfect. We now describe a fourth sampling approach, random queries. This approach is noteworthy for two reasons: it has been successfully built upon for a series of increasingly refined estimates, and conversely it has turned out to be the approach most likely to be misinterpreted and carelessly implemented, leading to misleading measurements. The idea is to pick a page (almost) uniformly at random from a search engine's index by posing a random query to it. It should be clear that picking a set of random terms from (say) Webster's dictionary is not a good way of implementing this idea. For one thing, not all vocabulary terms occur equally often, so this approach will not result in documents being chosen uniformly at random from the search engine. For another, there are a great many terms in web documents that do not occur in a standard dictionary such as Webster's. To address the problem of vocabulary terms not in a standard dictionary, we begin by amassing a sample web dictionary. This could be done by crawling a limited portion of the Web, or by crawling a manually-assembled representative subset of the Web such as Yahoo! (as was done in the earliest experiments with this method). Consider a conjunctive query with two or more randomly chosen words from this dictionary. Operationally, we proceed as follows: we use a random conjunctive query on and pick from the top 100 returned results a page at random. We then test for presence in by choosing 6-8 low-frequency terms in and using them in a conjunctive query for . We can improve the estimate by repeating the experiment a large number of times. Both the sampling process and the testing process have a number of issues. Our sample is biased towards longer documents. Picking from the top 100 results of induces a bias from the ranking algorithm of . Picking from all the results of makes the experiment slower. This is particularly so because most web search engines put up defenses against excessive robotic querying. During the checking phase, a number of additional biases are introduced: for instance, may not handle 8-word conjunctive queries properly. Either or may refuse to respond to the test queries, treating them as robotic spam rather than as bona fide queries. There could be operational problems like connection time-outs. A sequence of research has built on this basic paradigm to eliminate some of these issues; there is no perfect solution yet, but the level of sophistication in statistics for understanding the biases is increasing. The main idea is to address biases by estimating, for each document, the magnitude of the bias. From this, standard statistical sampling methods can generate unbiased samples. In the checking phase, the newer work moves away from conjunctive queries to phrase and other queries that appear to be better-behaved. Finally, newer experiments use other sampling methods besides random queries. The best known of these is document random walk sampling, in which a document is chosen by a random walk on a virtual graph derived from documents. In this graph, nodes are documents; two documents are connected by an edge if they share two or more words in common. The graph is never instantiated; rather, a random walk on it can be performed by moving from a document to another by picking a pair of keywords in , running a query on a search engine and picking a random document from the results. Details may be found in the references in Section 19.7 . Exercises. Two web search engines A and B each generate a large number of pages uniformly at random from their indexes. 30% of A's pages are present in B's index, while 50% of B's pages are present in A's index. What is the number of pages in A's index relative to B's?
iir_19_6	Near-duplicates and shingling 19.5 duplication The simplest approach to detecting duplicates is to compute, for each web page, a fingerprint that is a succinct (say 64-bit) digest of the characters on that page. Then, whenever the fingerprints of two web pages are equal, we test whether the pages themselves are equal and if so declare one of them to be a duplicate copy of the other. This simplistic approach fails to capture a crucial and widespread phenomenon on the Web: near duplication. In many cases, the contents of one web page are identical to those of another except for a few characters - say, a notation showing the date and time at which the page was last modified. Even in such cases, we want to be able to declare the two pages to be close enough that we only index one copy. Short of exhaustively comparing all pairs of web pages, an infeasible task at the scale of billions of pages, how can we detect and filter out such near duplicates? We now describe a solution to the problem of detecting near-duplicate web pages. The answer lies in a technique known as shingling . Given a positive integer and a sequence of terms in a document , define the -shingles of to be the set of all consecutive sequences of terms in . As an example, consider the following text: a rose is a rose is a rose. The 4-shingles for this text ( is a typical value used in the detection of near-duplicate web pages) are a rose is a, rose is a rose and is a rose is. The first two of these shingles each occur twice in the text. Intuitively, two documents are near duplicates if the sets of shingles generated from them are nearly the same. We now make this intuition precise, then develop a method for efficiently computing and comparing the sets of shingles for all web pages. Let denote the set of shingles of document . Recall the Jaccard coefficient from page 3.3.4 , which measures the degree of overlap between the sets and as ; denote this by . Our test for near duplication between and is to compute this Jaccard coefficient; if it exceeds a preset threshold (say, ), we declare them near duplicates and eliminate one from indexing. However, this does not appear to have simplified matters: we still have to compute Jaccard coefficients pairwise. To avoid this, we use a form of hashing. First, we map every shingle into a hash value over a large space, say 64 bits. For , let be the corresponding set of 64-bit hash values derived from . We now invoke the following trick to detect document pairs whose sets have large Jaccard overlaps. Let be a random permutation from the 64-bit integers to the 64-bit integers. Denote by the set of permuted hash values in ; thus for each , there is a corresponding value .  Let be the smallest integer in . Then Theorem. (247)  End theorem. Proof. We give the proof in a slightly more general setting: consider a family of sets whose elements are drawn from a common universe. View the sets as columns of a matrix , with one row for each element in the universe. The element if element is present in the set that the th column represents. Let be a random permutation of the rows of ; denote by the column that results from applying to the th column. Finally, let be the index of the first row in which the column has a . We then prove that for any two columns , (248)   Figure 19.9: Two sets and ; their Jaccard coefficient is . Consider two columns as shown in Figure 19.9 . The ordered pairs of entries of and partition the rows into four types: those with 0's in both of these columns, those with a 0 in and a 1 in , those with a 1 in and a 0 in , and finally those with 1's in both of these columns. Indeed, the first four rows of Figure 19.9 exemplify all of these four types of rows. Denote by the number of rows with 0's in both columns, the second, the third and the fourth. Then, (249)  249    249 End proof. Thus, our test for the Jaccard coefficient of the shingle sets is probabilistic: we compare the computed values from different documents. If a pair coincides, we have candidate near duplicates. Repeat the process independently for 200 random permutations (a choice suggested in the literature). Call the set of the 200 resulting values of the sketch of . We can then estimate the Jaccard coefficient for any pair of documents to be ; if this exceeds a preset threshold, we declare that and are similar. How can we quickly compute for all pairs ? Indeed, how do we represent all pairs of documents that are similar, without incurring a blowup that is quadratic in the number of documents? First, we use fingerprints to remove all but one copy of identical documents. We may also remove common HTML tags and integers from the shingle computation, to eliminate shingles that occur very commonly in documents without telling us anything about duplication. Next we use a union-find algorithm to create clusters that contain documents that are similar. To do this, we must accomplish a crucial step: going from the set of sketches to the set of pairs such that and are similar. To this end, we compute the number of shingles in common for any pair of documents whose sketches have any members in common. We begin with the list sorted by pairs. For each , we can now generate all pairs for which is present in both their sketches. From these we can compute, for each pair with non-zero sketch overlap, a count of the number of values they have in common. By applying a preset threshold, we know which pairs have heavily overlapping sketches. For instance, if the threshold were 80%, we would need the count to be at least 160 for any . As we identify such pairs, we run the union-find to group documents into near-duplicate ``syntactic clusters''. This is essentially a variant of the single-link clustering algorithm introduced in Section 17.2 (page ). One final trick cuts down the space needed in the computation of for pairs , which in principle could still demand space quadratic in the number of documents. To remove from consideration those pairs whose sketches have few shingles in common, we preprocess the sketch for each document as follows: sort the in the sketch, then shingle this sorted sequence to generate a set of super-shingles for each document. If two documents have a super-shingle in common, we proceed to compute the precise value of . This again is a heuristic but can be highly effective in cutting down the number of pairs for which we accumulate the sketch overlap counts. Exercises. Web search engines A and B each crawl a random subset of the same size of the Web. Some of the pages crawled are duplicates - exact textual copies of each other at different URLs. Assume that duplicates are distributed uniformly amongst the pages crawled by A and B. Further, assume that a duplicate is a page that has exactly two copies - no pages have more than two copies. A indexes pages without duplicate elimination whereas B indexes only one copy of each duplicate page. The two random subsets have the same size before duplicate elimination. If, 45% of A's indexed URLs are present in B's index, while 50% of B's indexed URLs are present in A's index, what fraction of the Web consists of pages that do not have a duplicate? Instead of using the process depicted in Figure 19.8 , consider instead the following process for estimating the Jaccard coefficient of the overlap between two sets and . We pick a random subset of the elements of the universe from which and are drawn; this corresponds to picking a random subset of the rows of the matrix in the proof. We exhaustively compute the Jaccard coefficient of these random subsets. Why is this estimate an unbiased estimator of the Jaccard coefficient for and ? Explain why this estimator would be very difficult to use in practice.

iir_1_1	An example information retrieval problem A fat book which many people own is Shakespeare's Collected Works. Suppose you wanted to determine which plays of Shakespeare contain the words Brutus AND Caesar and NOT Calpurnia. One way to do that is to start at the beginning and to read through all the text, noting for each play whether it contains Brutus and Caesar and excluding it from consideration if it contains Calpurnia. The simplest form of document retrieval is for a computer to do this sort of linear scan through documents. This process is commonly referred to as grepping through text, after the Unix command grep, which performs this process. Grepping through text can be a very effective process, especially given the speed of modern computers, and often allows useful possibilities for wildcard pattern matching through the use of . With modern computers, for simple querying of modest collections (the size of Shakespeare's Collected Works is a bit under one million words of text in total), you really need nothing more. But for many purposes, you do need more: To process large document collections quickly. The amount of online data has grown at least as quickly as the speed of computers, and we would now like to be able to search collections that total in the order of billions to trillions of words. To allow more flexible matching operations. For example, it is impractical to perform the query Romans NEAR countrymen with grep, where NEAR might be defined as ``within 5 words'' or ``within the same sentence''. To allow ranked retrieval: in many cases you want the best answer to an information need among many documents that contain certain words. The way to avoid linearly scanning the texts for each query is to index the documents in advance. Let us stick with Shakespeare's Collected Works, and use it to introduce the basics of the Boolean retrieval model. Suppose we record for each document - here a play of Shakespeare's - whether it contains each word out of all the words Shakespeare used (Shakespeare used about 32,000 different words). The result is a binary term-document incidence matrix , as in Figure 1.1 . Terms are the indexed units (further discussed in Section 2.2 ); they are usually words, and for the moment you can think of them as words, but the information retrieval literature normally speaks of terms because some of them, such as perhaps I-9 or Hong Kong are not usually thought of as words. Now, depending on whether we look at the matrix rows or columns, we can have a vector for each term, which shows the documents it appears in, or a vector for each document, showing the terms that occur in it.   To answer the query Brutus AND Caesar AND NOT Calpurnia, we take the vectors for Brutus, Caesar and Calpurnia, complement the last, and then do a bitwise AND: 110100 AND 110111 AND 101111 = 100100 1.2 The Boolean retrieval model is a model for information retrieval in which we can pose any query which is in the form of a Boolean expression of terms, that is, in which terms are combined with the operators and, or, and not. The model views each document as just a set of words.  Figure: Results from Shakespeare for the query Brutus AND Caesar AND NOT Calpurnia. Let us now consider a more realistic scenario, simultaneously using the opportunity to introduce some terminology and notation. Suppose we have documents. By documents we mean whatever units we have decided to build a retrieval system over. They might be individual memos or chapters of a book (see Section 2.1.2 (page ) for further discussion). We will refer to the group of documents over which we perform retrieval as the (document) collection . It is sometimes also referred to as a corpus (a body of texts). Suppose each document is about 1000 words long (2-3 book pages). If we assume an average of 6 bytes per word including spaces and punctuation, then this is a document collection about 6 GB in size. Typically, there might be about distinct terms in these documents. There is nothing special about the numbers we have chosen, and they might vary by an order of magnitude or more, but they give us some idea of the dimensions of the kinds of problems we need to handle. We will discuss and model these size assumptions in Section 5.1 (page ). Our goal is to develop a system to address the ad hoc retrieval task. This is the most standard IR task. In it, a system aims to provide documents from within the collection that are relevant to an arbitrary user information need, communicated to the system by means of a one-off, user-initiated query. An information need is the topic about which the user desires to know more, and is differentiated from a query , which is what the user conveys to the computer in an attempt to communicate the information need. A document is relevant if it is one that the user perceives as containing information of value with respect to their personal information need. Our example above was rather artificial in that the information need was defined in terms of particular words, whereas usually a user is interested in a topic like ``pipeline leaks'' and would like to find relevant documents regardless of whether they precisely use those words or express the concept with other words such as pipeline rupture. To assess the effectiveness of an IR system (i.e., the quality of its search results), a user will usually want to know two key statistics about the system's returned results for a query: Precision : What fraction of the returned results are relevant to the information need? Recall : What fraction of the relevant documents in the collection were returned by the system? 8 We now cannot build a term-document matrix in a naive way. A matrix has half-a-trillion 0's and 1's - too many to fit in a computer's memory. But the crucial observation is that the matrix is extremely sparse, that is, it has few non-zero entries. Because each document is 1000 words long, the matrix has no more than one billion 1's, so a minimum of 99.8% of the cells are zero. A much better representation is to record only the things that do occur, that is, the 1 positions. This idea is central to the first major concept in information retrieval, the inverted index . The name is actually redundant: an index always maps back from terms to the parts of a document where they occur. Nevertheless, inverted index, or sometimes inverted file , has become the standard term in information retrieval.The basic idea of an inverted index is shown in Figure 1.3 . We keep a dictionary of terms (sometimes also referred to as a vocabulary or lexicon ; in this book, we use dictionary for the data structure and vocabulary for the set of terms). Then for each term, we have a list that records which documents the term occurs in. Each item in the list - which records that a term appeared in a document (and, later, often, the positions in the document) - is conventionally called a posting .The list is then called a postings list (or ), and all the postings lists taken together are referred to as the postings . The dictionary in Figure 1.3 has been sorted alphabetically and each postings list is sorted by document ID. We will see why this is useful in Section 1.3 , below, but later we will also consider alternatives to doing this (Section 7.1.5 ).
iir_1_2	A first take at building an inverted index To gain the speed benefits of indexing at retrieval time, we have to build the index in advance. The major steps in this are: Collect the documents to be indexed: ... Tokenize the text, turning each document into a list of tokens: ... Do linguistic preprocessing, producing a list of normalized tokens, which are the indexing terms: ... Index the documents that each term occurs in by creating an inverted index, consisting of a dictionary and postings. 2.2  tokens normalized tokens words  sort-based indexing   Within a document collection, we assume that each document has a unique serial number, known as the document identifier ( docID ). During index construction, we can simply assign successive integers to each new document when it is first encountered. The input to indexing is a list of normalized tokens for each document, which we can equally think of as a list of pairs of term and docID, as in Figure 1.4 . The core indexing step is sorting this list so that the terms are alphabetical, giving us the representation in the middle column of Figure 1.4 . Multiple occurrences of the same term from the same document are then merged.Instances of the same term are then grouped, and the result is split into a dictionary and postings , as shown in the right column of Figure 1.4 . Since a term generally occurs in a number of documents, this data organization already reduces the storage requirements of the index. The dictionary also records some statistics, such as the number of documents which contain each term (the document frequency , which is here also the length of each postings list). This information is not vital for a basic Boolean search engine, but it allows us to improve the efficiency of the search engine at query time, and it is a statistic later used in many ranked retrieval models. The postings are secondarily sorted by docID. This provides the basis for efficient query processing. This inverted index structure is essentially without rivals as the most efficient structure for supporting ad hoc text search. In the resulting index, we pay for storage of both the dictionary and the postings lists. The latter are much larger, but the dictionary is commonly kept in memory, while postings lists are normally kept on disk, so the size of each is important, and in Chapter 5 we will examine how each can be optimized for storage and access efficiency. What data structure should be used for a postings list? A fixed length array would be wasteful as some words occur in many documents, and others in very few. For an in-memory postings list, two good alternatives are singly linked lists or variable length arrays. Singly linked lists allow cheap insertion of documents into postings lists (following updates, such as when recrawling the web for updated documents), and naturally extend to more advanced indexing strategies such as skip lists (Section 2.3 ), which require additional pointers. Variable length arrays win in space requirements by avoiding the overhead for pointers and in time requirements because their use of contiguous memory increases speed on modern processors with memory caches. Extra pointers can in practice be encoded into the lists as offsets. If updates are relatively infrequent, variable length arrays will be more compact and faster to traverse. We can also use a hybrid scheme with a linked list of fixed length arrays for each term. When postings lists are stored on disk, they are stored (perhaps compressed) as a contiguous run of postings without explicit pointers (as in Figure 1.3 ), so as to minimize the size of the postings list and the number of disk seeks to read a postings list into memory. Exercises. Draw the inverted index that would be built for the following document collection. (See Figure 1.3 for an example.)

Draw the inverted index representation for this collection, as in Figure 1.3 (page ). For the document collection shown in Exercise 1.2 , what are the returned results for these queries: schizophrenia AND drug for AND NOT(drug OR approach)
iir_1_3	Processing Boolean queries How do we process a query using an inverted index and the basic Boolean retrieval model? Consider processing the simple conjunctive query : over the inverted index partially shown in Figure 1.3 (page ). We: Locate Brutus in the Dictionary Retrieve its postings Locate Calpurnia in the Dictionary Retrieve its postings Intersect the two postings lists, as shown in Figure 1.5 .  intersection  merging  merge algorithm  Figure: Intersecting the postings lists for Brutus and Calpurnia from Figure 1.3 .  Figure 1.6: Algorithm for the intersection of two postings lists and . There is a simple and effective method of intersecting postings lists using the merge algorithm (see Figure 1.6 ): we maintain pointers into both lists and walk through the two postings lists simultaneously, in time linear in the total number of postings entries. At each step, we compare the docID pointed to by both pointers. If they are the same, we put that docID in the results list, and advance both pointers. Otherwise we advance the pointer pointing to the smaller docID. If the lengths of the postings lists are and , the intersection takes operations. Formally, the complexity of querying is ,where is the number of documents in the collection.Our indexing methods gain us just a constant, not a difference in time complexity compared to a linear scan, but in practice the constant is huge. To use this algorithm, it is crucial that postings be sorted by a single global ordering. Using a numeric sort by docID is one simple way to achieve this. We can extend the intersection operation to process more complicated queries like: Query optimization is the process of selecting how to organize the work of answering a query so that the least total amount of work needs to be done by the system. A major element of this for Boolean queries is the order in which postings lists are accessed. What is the best order for query processing? Consider a query that is an AND of terms, for instance: For each of the terms, we need to get its postings, then AND them together. The standard heuristic is to process terms in order of increasing document frequency: if we start by intersecting the two smallest postings lists, then all intermediate results must be no bigger than the smallest postings list, and we are therefore likely to do the least amount of total work. So, for the postings lists in Figure 1.3 (page ), we execute the above query as: This is a first justification for keeping the frequency of terms in the dictionary: it allows us to make this ordering decision based on in-memory data before accessing any postings list. Consider now the optimization of more general queries, such as: As before, we will get the frequencies for all terms, and we can then (conservatively) estimate the size of each OR by the sum of the frequencies of its disjuncts. We can then process the query in increasing order of the size of each disjunctive term.  Figure 1.7: Algorithm for conjunctive queries that returns the set of documents containing each term in the input list of terms. For arbitrary Boolean queries, we have to evaluate and temporarily store the answers for intermediate expressions in a complex expression. However, in many circumstances, either because of the nature of the query language, or just because this is the most common type of query that users submit, a query is purely conjunctive. In this case, rather than viewing merging postings lists as a function with two inputs and a distinct output, it is more efficient to intersect each retrieved postings list with the current intermediate result in memory, where we initialize the intermediate result by loading the postings list of the least frequent term. This algorithm is shown in Figure 1.7 . The intersection operation is then asymmetric: the intermediate results list is in memory while the list it is being intersected with is being read from disk. Moreover the intermediate results list is always at least as short as the other list, and in many cases it is orders of magnitude shorter. The postings intersection can still be done by the algorithm in Figure 1.6 , but when the difference between the list lengths is very large, opportunities to use alternative techniques open up. The intersection can be calculated in place by destructively modifying or marking invalid items in the intermediate results list. Or the intersection can be done as a sequence of binary searches in the long postings lists for each posting in the intermediate results list. Another possibility is to store the long postings list as a hashtable, so that membership of an intermediate result item can be calculated in constant rather than linear or log time. However, such alternative techniques are difficult to combine with postings list compression of the sort discussed in Chapter 5 . Moreover, standard postings list intersection operations remain necessary when both terms of a query are very common. Exercises. For the queries below, can we still run through the intersection in time , where and are the lengths of the postings lists for Brutus and Caesar? If not, what can we achieve? Brutus and not Caesar Brutus or not Caesar Extend the postings merge algorithm to arbitrary Boolean query formulas. What is its time complexity? For instance, consider: c. (Brutus OR Caesar) AND NOT (Antony OR Cleopatra) Can we always merge in linear time? Linear in what? Can we do better than this? We can use distributive laws for and and or to rewrite queries. Show how to rewrite the query in Exercise 1.3 into disjunctive normal form using the distributive laws. Would the resulting query be more or less efficiently evaluated than the original form of this query? Is this result true in general or does it depend on the words and the contents of the document collection? Recommend a query processing order for d. (tangerine OR trees) AND (marmalade OR skies) AND (kaleidoscope OR eyes) given the following postings list sizes: Term Postings size eyes 213312 kaleidoscope 87009 marmalade 107913 skies 271658 tangerine 46653 trees 316812 If the query is: e. friends AND romans AND (NOT countrymen) how could we use the frequency of countrymen in evaluating the best query evaluation order? In particular, propose a way of handling negation in determining the order of query processing. For a conjunctive query, is processing postings lists in order of size guaranteed to be optimal? Explain why it is, or give an example where it isn't. Write out a postings merge algorithm, in the style of Figure 1.6 (page ), for an OR query. How should the Boolean query AND NOT be handled? Why is naive evaluation of this query normally very expensive? Write out a postings merge algorithm that evaluates this query efficiently.
iir_1_4	The extended Boolean model versus ranked retrieval The Boolean retrieval model contrasts with ranked retrieval models such as the vector space model (Section 6.3 ), in which users largely use free text queries , that is, just typing one or more words rather than using a precise language with operators for building up query expressions, and the system decides which documents best satisfy the query. Despite decades of academic research on the advantages of ranked retrieval, systems implementing the Boolean retrieval model were the main or only search option provided by large commercial information providers for three decades until the early 1990s (approximately the date of arrival of the World Wide Web). However, these systems did not have just the basic Boolean operations (AND, OR, and NOT) which we have presented so far. A strict Boolean expression over terms with an unordered results set is too limited for many of the information needs that people have, and these systems implemented extended Boolean retrieval models by incorporating additional operators such as term proximity operators. A proximity operator is a way of specifying that two terms in a query must occur close to each other in a document, where closeness may be measured by limiting the allowed number of intervening words or by reference to a structural unit such as a sentence or paragraph.  Worked example. Commercial Boolean searching: Westlaw.westlaw Westlaw (http://www.westlaw.com/) is the largest commercial legal search service (in terms of the number of paying subscribers), with over half a million subscribers performing millions of searches a day over tens of terabytes of text data. The service was started in 1975. In 2005, Boolean search (called ``Terms and Connectors'' by Westlaw) was still the default, and used by a large percentage of users, although ranked free text querying (called ``Natural Language'' by Westlaw) was added in 1992. Here are some example Boolean queries on Westlaw:  Information need: Information on the legal theories involved in preventing the disclosure of trade secrets by employees formerly employed by a competing company. Query: "trade secret" /s disclos! /s prevent /s employe!  Information need: Requirements for disabled people to be able to access a workplace. Query: disab! /p access! /s work-site work-place (employment /3 place)    Information need: Cases about a host's responsibility for drunk guests. Query: host! /p (responsib! liab!) /p (intoxicat! drunk!) /p guest Note the long, precise queries and the use of proximity operators, both uncommon in web search. Submitted queries average about ten words in length. Unlike web search conventions, a space between words represents disjunction (the tightest binding operator),   is AND and /s, /p, and / ask for matches in the same sentence, same paragraph or within words respectively. Double quotes give a phrase search (consecutive words); see Section 2.4 (page ). The exclamation mark (!) gives a trailing wildcard query wildcard; thus liab! matches all words starting with liab. Additionally work-site matches any of worksite, work-site or work site; see Section 2.2.1 (page ). Typical expert queries are usually carefully defined and incrementally developed until they obtain what look to be good results to the user. Many users, particularly professionals, prefer Boolean query models. Boolean queries are precise: a document either matches the query or it does not. This offers the user greater control and transparency over what is retrieved. And some domains, such as legal materials, allow an effective means of document ranking within a Boolean model: Westlaw returns documents in reverse chronological order, which is in practice quite effective. In 2007, the majority of law librarians still seem to recommend terms and connectors for high recall searches, and the majority of legal users think they are getting greater control by using them. However, this does not mean that Boolean queries are more effective for professional searchers. Indeed, experimenting on a Westlaw subcollection, Turtle (1994) found that free text queries produced better results than Boolean queries prepared by Westlaw's own reference librarians for the majority of the information needs in his experiments. A general problem with Boolean search is that using AND operators tends to produce high precision but low recall searches, while using OR operators gives low precision but high recall searches, and it is difficult or impossible to find a satisfactory middle ground. End worked example. In this chapter, we have looked at the structure and construction of a basic inverted index, comprising a dictionary and postings lists. We introduced the Boolean retrieval model, and examined how to do efficient retrieval via linear time merges and simple query optimization. In dictionaryranking-ir-system we will consider in detail richer query models and the sort of augmented index structures that are needed to handle them efficiently. Here we just mention a few of the main additional things we would like to be able to do: We would like to better determine the set of terms in the dictionary and to provide retrieval that is tolerant to spelling mistakes and inconsistent choice of words. It is often useful to search for compounds or phrases that denote a concept such as ``operating system''. As the Westlaw examples show, we might also wish to do proximity queries such as Gates near Microsoft. To answer such queries, the index has to be augmented to capture the proximities of terms in documents. A Boolean model only records term presence or absence, but often we would like to accumulate evidence, giving more weight to documents that have a term several times as opposed to ones that contain it only once. To be able to do this we need term frequency information (the number of times a term occurs in a document) in postings lists. Boolean queries just retrieve a set of matching documents, but commonly we wish to have an effective method to order (or ``rank'') the returned results. This requires having a mechanism for determining a document score which encapsulates how good a match a document is for a query. With these additional ideas, we will have seen most of the basic technology that supports ad hoc searching over unstructured information. Ad hoc searching over documents has recently conquered the world, powering not only web search engines but the kind of unstructured search that lies behind the large eCommerce websites. Although the main web search engines differ by emphasizing free text querying , most of the basic issues and technologies of indexing and querying remain the same, as we will see in later chapters. Moreover, over time, web search engines have added at least partial implementations of some of the most popular operators from extended Boolean models: phrase search is especially popular and most have a very partial implementation of Boolean operators. Nevertheless, while these options are liked by expert searchers, they are little used by most people and are not the main focus in work on trying to improve web search engine performance. Exercises. Write a query using Westlaw syntax which would find any of the words professor, teacher, or lecturer in the same sentence as a form of the verb explain. Try using the Boolean search features on a couple of major web search engines. For instance, choose a word, such as burglar, and submit the queries (i) burglar, (ii) burglar AND burglar, and (iii) burglar OR burglar. Look at the estimated number of results and top hits. Do they make sense in terms of Boolean logic? Often they haven't for major search engines. Can you make sense of what is going on? What about if you try different words? For example, query for (i) knight, (ii) conquer, and then (iii) knight OR conquer. What bound should the number of results from the first two queries place on the third query? Is this bound observed?
iir_1_5	References and further reading The practical pursuit of computerized information retrieval began in the late 1940s (Cleverdon, 1991, Liddy, 2005). A great increase in the production of scientific literature, much in the form of less formal technical reports rather than traditional journal articles, coupled with the availability of computers, led to interest in automatic document retrieval. However, in those days, document retrieval was always based on author, title, and keywords; full-text search came much later. The article of Bush (1945) provided lasting inspiration for the new field: ``Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, `memex' will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.'' Information Retrieval Mooers, 1950 In 1958, much newspaper attention was paid to demonstrations at a conference (see Taube and Wooster, 1958) of IBM ``auto-indexing'' machines, based primarily on the work of H. P. Luhn. Commercial interest quickly gravitated towards Boolean retrieval systems, but the early years saw a heady debate over various disparate technologies for retrieval systems. For example Mooers (1961) dissented: ``It is a common fallacy, underwritten at this date by the investment of several million dollars in a variety of retrieval hardware, that the algebra of George Boole (1847) is the appropriate formalism for retrieval system design. This view is as widely and uncritically accepted as it is wrong.'' Lee and Fox, 1988 The book (Witten et al., 1999) is the standard reference for an in-depth comparison of the space and time efficiency of the inverted index versus other possible data structures; a more succinct and up-to-date presentation appears in Zobel and Moffat (2006). We further discuss several approaches in Chapter 5 . Friedl (2006) covers the practical usage of regular expressions for searching. The underlying computer science appears in (Hopcroft et al., 2000).

iir_20_1	Overview 19 19.7  web crawler  spider The goal of this chapter is not to describe how to build the crawler for a full-scale commercial web search engine. We focus instead on a range of issues that are generic to crawling from the student project scale to substantial research projects. We begin (Section 20.1.1 ) by listing desiderata for web crawlers, and then discuss in Section 20.2 how each of these issues is addressed. The remainder of this chapter describes the architecture and some implementation details for a distributed web crawler that satisfies these features. Section 20.3 discusses distributing indexes across many machines for a web-scale implementation.  Subsections Features a crawler must provide Features a crawler should provide
iir_20_1_1	Features a crawler must provide must should Robustness: The Web contains servers that create spider traps, which are generators of web pages that mislead crawlers into getting stuck fetching an infinite number of pages in a particular domain. Crawlers must be designed to be resilient to such traps. Not all such traps are malicious; some are the inadvertent side-effect of faulty website development. Politeness: Web servers have both implicit and explicit policies regulating the rate at which a crawler can visit them. These politeness policies must be respected.
iir_20_1_2	Features a crawler should provide Distributed: The crawler should have the ability to execute in a distributed fashion across multiple machines. Scalable: The crawler architecture should permit scaling up the crawl rate by adding extra machines and bandwidth. Performance and efficiency: The crawl system should make efficient use of various system resources including processor, storage and network bandwidth. Quality: Given that a significant fraction of all web pages are of poor utility for serving user query needs, the crawler should be biased towards fetching ``useful'' pages first. Freshness: In many applications, the crawler should operate in continuous mode: it should obtain fresh copies of previously fetched pages. A search engine crawler, for instance, can thus ensure that the search engine's index contains a fairly current representation of each indexed web page. For such continuous crawling, a crawler should be able to crawl a page with a frequency that approximates the rate of change of that page. Extensible: Crawlers should be designed to be extensible in many ways - to cope with new data formats, new fetch protocols, and so on. This demands that the crawler architecture be modular.
iir_20_2	Crawling seed set 4 5 URL frontier 19 This seemingly simple recursive traversal of the web graph is complicated by the many demands on a practical web crawling system: the crawler has to be distributed, scalable, efficient, polite, robust and extensible while fetching pages of high quality. We examine the effects of each of these issues. Our treatment follows the design of the Mercator crawler that has formed the basis of a number of research and commercial crawlers. As a reference point, fetching a billion pages (a small fraction of the static Web at present) in a month-long crawl requires fetching several hundred pages each second. We will see how to use a multi-threaded design to address several bottlenecks in the overall crawler system in order to attain this fetch rate. Before proceeding to this detailed description, we reiterate for readers who may attempt to build crawlers of some basic properties any non-professional crawler should satisfy: Only one connection should be open to any given host at a time. A waiting time of a few seconds should occur between successive requests to a host. Politeness restrictions detailed in Section 20.2.1 should be obeyed.   Subsections Crawler architecture Distributing the crawler DNS resolution The URL frontier
iir_20_2_1	Crawler architecture The simple scheme outlined above for crawling demands several modules that fit together as shown in Figure 20.1 . The URL frontier, containing URLs yet to be fetched in the current crawl (in the case of continuous crawling, a URL may have been fetched previously but is back in the frontier for re-fetching). We describe this further in Section 20.2.3 . A DNS resolution module that determines the web server from which to fetch the page specified by a URL. We describe this further in Section 20.2.2 . A fetch module that uses the http protocol to retrieve the web page at a URL. A parsing module that extracts the text and set of links from a fetched web page. A duplicate elimination module that determines whether an extracted link is already in the URL frontier or has recently been fetched.  Figure 20.1: The basic crawler architecture. Crawling is performed by anywhere from one to potentially hundreds of threads, each of which loops through the logical cycle in Figure 20.1 . These threads may be run in a single process, or be partitioned amongst multiple processes running at different nodes of a distributed system. We begin by assuming that the URL frontier is in place and non-empty and defer our description of the implementation of the URL frontier to Section 20.2.3 . We follow the progress of a single URL through the cycle of being fetched, passing through various checks and filters, then finally (for continuous crawling) being returned to the URL frontier. A crawler thread begins by taking a URL from the frontier and fetching the web page at that URL, generally using the http protocol. The fetched page is then written into a temporary store, where a number of operations are performed on it. Next, the page is parsed and the text as well as the links in it are extracted. The text (with any tag information - e.g., terms in boldface) is passed on to the indexer. Link information including anchor text is also passed on to the indexer for use in ranking in ways that are described in Chapter 21 . In addition, each extracted link goes through a series of tests to determine whether the link should be added to the URL frontier. First, the thread tests whether a web page with the same content has already been seen at another URL. The simplest implementation for this would use a simple fingerprint such as a checksum (placed in a store labeled "Doc FP's" in Figure 20.1 ). A more sophisticated test would use shingles instead of fingerprints, as described in Chapter 19 . Next, a URL filter is used to determine whether the extracted URL should be excluded from the frontier based on one of several tests. For instance, the crawl may seek to exclude certain domains (say, all .com URLs) - in this case the test would simply filter out the URL if it were from the .com domain. A similar test could be inclusive rather than exclusive. Many hosts on the Web place certain portions of their websites off-limits to crawling, under a standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol , except for the robot called ``searchengine''.  User-agent: * Disallow: /yoursite/temp/  User-agent: searchengine Disallow: The robots.txt file must be fetched from a website in order to test whether the URL under consideration passes the robot restrictions, and can therefore be added to the URL frontier. Rather than fetch it afresh for testing on each URL to be added to the frontier, a cache can be used to obtain a recently fetched copy of the file for the host. This is especially important since many of the links extracted from a page fall within the host from which the page was fetched and therefore can be tested against the host's robots.txt file. Thus, by performing the filtering during the link extraction process, we would have especially high locality in the stream of hosts that we need to test for robots.txt files, leading to high cache hit rates. Unfortunately, this runs afoul of webmasters' politeness expectations. A URL (particularly one referring to a low-quality or rarely changing document) may be in the frontier for days or even weeks. If we were to perform the robots filtering before adding such a URL to the frontier, its robots.txt file could have changed by the time the URL is dequeued from the frontier and fetched. We must consequently perform robots-filtering immediately before attempting to fetch a web page. As it turns out, maintaining a cache of robots.txt files is still highly effective; there is sufficient locality even in the stream of URLs dequeued from the URL frontier. Next, a URL should be normalized in the following sense: often the HTML encoding of a link from a web page indicates the target of that link relative to the page . Thus, there is a relative link encoded thus in the HTML of the page en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page: Disclaimers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer Finally, the URL is checked for duplicate elimination: if the URL is already in the frontier or (in the case of a non-continuous crawl) already crawled, we do not add it to the frontier. When the URL is added to the frontier, it is assigned a priority based on which it is eventually removed from the frontier for fetching. The details of this priority queuing are in Section 20.2.3 . Certain housekeeping tasks are typically performed by a dedicated thread. This thread is generally quiescent except that it wakes up once every few seconds to log crawl progress statistics (URLs crawled, frontier size, etc.), decide whether to terminate the crawl, or (once every few hours of crawling) checkpoint the crawl. In checkpointing, a snapshot of the crawler's state (say, the URL frontier) is committed to disk. In the event of a catastrophic crawler failure, the crawl is restarted from the most recent checkpoint.   Subsections Distributing the crawler
iir_20_2_2	DNS resolution  IP address  DNS resolution Domain Name Service  DNS server en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System DNS resolution is a well-known bottleneck in web crawling. Due to the distributed nature of the Domain Name Service, DNS resolution may entail multiple requests and round-trips across the internet, requiring seconds and sometimes even longer. Right away, this puts in jeopardy our goal of fetching several hundred documents a second. A standard remedy is to introduce caching: URLs for which we have recently performed DNS lookups are likely to be found in the DNS cache, avoiding the need to go to the DNS servers on the internet. However, obeying politeness constraints (see Section 20.2.3 ) limits the of cache hit rate. There is another important difficulty in DNS resolution; the lookup implementations in standard libraries (likely to be used by anyone developing a crawler) are generally synchronous. This means that once a request is made to the Domain Name Service, other crawler threads at that node are blocked until the first request is completed. To circumvent this, most web crawlers implement their own DNS resolver as a component of the crawler. Thread executing the resolver code sends a message to the DNS server and then performs a timed wait: it resumes either when being signaled by another thread or when a set time quantum expires. A single, separate DNS thread listens on the standard DNS port (port 53) for incoming response packets from the name service. Upon receiving a response, it signals the appropriate crawler thread (in this case, ) and hands it the response packet if has not yet resumed because its time quantum has expired. A crawler thread that resumes because its wait time quantum has expired retries for a fixed number of attempts, sending out a new message to the DNS server and performing a timed wait each time; the designers of Mercator recommend of the order of five attempts. The time quantum of the wait increases exponentially with each of these attempts; Mercator started with one second and ended with roughly 90 seconds, in consideration of the fact that there are host names that take tens of seconds to resolve.
iir_20_2_3	The URL frontier The second consideration is politeness: we must avoid repeated fetch requests to a host within a short time span. The likelihood of this is exacerbated because of a form of locality of reference: many URLs link to other URLs at the same host. As a result, a URL frontier implemented as a simple priority queue might result in a burst of fetch requests to a host. This might occur even if we were to constrain the crawler so that at most one thread could fetch from any single host at any time. A common heuristic is to insert a gap between successive fetch requests to a host that is an order of magnitude larger than the time taken for the most recent fetch from that host.   Figure 20.3 shows a polite and prioritizing implementation of a URL frontier. Its goals are to ensure that (i) only one connection is open at a time to any host; (ii) a waiting time of a few seconds occurs between successive requests to a host and (iii) high-priority pages are crawled preferentially. The two major sub-modules are a set of front queues in the upper portion of the figure, and a set of back queues in the lower part; all of these are FIFO queues. The front queues implement the prioritization, while the back queues implement politeness. In the flow of a URL added to the frontier as it makes its way through the front and back queues, a prioritizer first assigns to the URL an integer priority between 1 and based on its fetch history (taking into account the rate at which the web page at this URL has changed between previous crawls). For instance, a document that has exhibited frequent change would be assigned a higher priority. Other heuristics could be application-dependent and explicit - for instance, URLs from news services may always be assigned the highest priority. Now that it has been assigned priority , the URL is now appended to the th of the front queues. Each of the back queues maintains the following invariants: (i) it is non-empty while the crawl is in progress and (ii) it only contains URLs from a single host. An auxiliary table (Figure 20.4 ) is used to maintain the mapping from hosts to back queues. Whenever a back-queue is empty and is being re-filled from a front-queue, table must be updated accordingly. In addition, we maintain a heap with one entry for each back queue, the entry being the earliest time at which the host corresponding to that queue can be contacted again.  Figure 20.4: Example of an auxiliary hosts-to-back queues table. A crawler thread requesting a URL from the frontier extracts the root of this heap and (if necessary) waits until the corresponding time entry . It then takes the URL at the head of the back queue corresponding to the extracted heap root, and proceeds to fetch the URL . After fetching , the calling thread checks whether is empty. If so, it picks a front queue and extracts from its head a URL . The choice of front queue is biased (usually by a random process) towards queues of higher priority, ensuring that URLs of high priority flow more quickly into the back queues. We examine to check whether there is already a back queue holding URLs from its host. If so, is added to that queue and we reach back to the front queues to find another candidate URL for insertion into the now-empty queue . This process continues until is non-empty again. In any case, the thread inserts a heap entry for with a new earliest time based on the properties of the URL in that was last fetched (such as when its host was last contacted as well as the time taken for the last fetch), then continues with its processing. For instance, the new entry could be the current time plus ten times the last fetch time. The number of front queues, together with the policy of assigning priorities and picking queues, determines the priority properties we wish to build into the system. The number of back queues governs the extent to which we can keep all crawl threads busy while respecting politeness. The designers of Mercator recommend a rough rule of three times as many back queues as crawler threads. On a Web-scale crawl, the URL frontier may grow to the point where it demands more memory at a node than is available. The solution is to let most of the URL frontier reside on disk. A portion of each queue is kept in memory, with more brought in from disk as it is drained in memory. Exercises. Why is it better to partition hosts (rather than individual URLs) between the nodes of a distributed crawl system? Why should the host splitter precede the Duplicate URL Eliminator? In the preceding discussion we encountered two recommended ``hard constants'' - the increment on being ten times the last fetch time, and the number of back queues being three times the number of crawl threads. How are these two constants related?
iir_20_3	Distributing indexes In Section 4.4 we described distributed indexing. We now consider the distribution of the index across a large computer cluster that supports querying. Two obvious alternative index implementations suggest themselves: partitioning by terms , also known as global index organization, and partitioning by documents , also know as local index organization. In the former, the dictionary of index terms is partitioned into subsets, each subset residing at a node. Along with the terms at a node, we keep the postings for those terms. A query is routed to the nodes corresponding to its query terms. In principle, this allows greater concurrency since a stream of queries with different query terms would hit different sets of machines. In practice, partitioning indexes by vocabulary terms turns out to be non-trivial. Multi-word queries require the sending of long postings lists between sets of nodes for merging, and the cost of this can outweigh the greater concurrency. Load balancing the partition is governed not by an a priori analysis of relative term frequencies, but rather by the distribution of query terms and their co-occurrences, which can drift with time or exhibit sudden bursts. Achieving good partitions is a function of the co-occurrences of query terms and entails the clustering of terms to optimize objectives that are not easy to quantify. Finally, this strategy makes implementation of dynamic indexing more difficult. A more common implementation is to partition by documents: each node contains the index for a subset of all documents. Each query is distributed to all nodes, with the results from various nodes being merged before presentation to the user. This strategy trades more local disk seeks for less inter-node communication. One difficulty in this approach is that global statistics used in scoring - such as idf - must be computed across the entire document collection even though the index at any single node only contains a subset of the documents. These are computed by distributed ``background'' processes that periodically refresh the node indexes with fresh global statistics. How do we decide the partition of documents to nodes? Based on our development of the crawler architecture in Section 20.2.1 , one simple approach would be to assign all pages from a host to a single node. This partitioning could follow the partitioning of hosts to crawler nodes. A danger of such partitioning is that on many queries, a preponderance of the results would come from documents at a small number of hosts (and hence a small number of index nodes). A hash of each URL into the space of index nodes results in a more uniform distribution of query-time computation across nodes. At query time, the query is broadcast to each of the nodes, with the top results from each node being merged to find the top documents for the query. A common implementation heuristic is to partition the document collection into indexes of documents that are more likely to score highly on most queries (using, for instance, techniques in Chapter 21 ) and low-scoring indexes with the remaining documents. We only search the low-scoring indexes when there are too few matches in the high-scoring indexes, as described in Section 7.2.1 .
iir_20_4	Connectivity servers 21  connectivity server  connectivity queries which URLs link to a given URL? which URLs does a given URL link to? link analysis 21 Suppose that the Web had four billion pages, each with ten links to other pages. In the simplest form, we would require 32 bits or 4 bytes to specify each end (source and destination) of each link, requiring a total of (250)  5 We assume that each web page is represented by a unique integer; the specific scheme used to assign these integers is described below. We build an adjacency table that resembles an inverted index: it has a row for each web page, with the rows ordered by the corresponding integers. The row for any page contains a sorted list of integers, each corresponding to a web page that links to . This table permits us to respond to queries of the form which pages link to ? In similar fashion we build a table whose entries are the pages linked to by . This table representation cuts the space taken by the naive representation (in which we explicitly represent each link by its two end points, each a 32-bit integer) by 50%. Our description below will focus on the table for the links from each page; it should be clear that the techniques apply just as well to the table of links to each page. To further reduce the storage for the table, we exploit several ideas: Similarity between lists: Many rows of the table have many entries in common. Thus, if we explicitly represent a prototype row for several similar rows, the remainder can be succinctly expressed in terms of the prototypical row. Locality: many links from a page go to ``nearby'' pages - pages on the same host, for instance. This suggests that in encoding the destination of a link, we can often use small integers and thereby save space. We use gap encodings in sorted lists: rather than store the destination of each link, we store the offset from the previous entry in the row. In a lexicographic ordering of all URLs, we treat each URL as an alphanumeric string and sort these strings. Figure 20.5 shows a segment of this sorted order. For a true lexicographic sort of web pages, the domain name part of the URL should be inverted, so that www.stanford.edu becomes edu.stanford.www, but this is not necessary here since we are mainly concerned with links local to a single host.  Figure 20.5: A lexicographically ordered set of URLs. To each URL, we assign its position in this ordering as the unique identifying integer. Figure 20.6 shows an example of such a numbering and the resulting table. In this example sequence, www.stanford.edu/biology is assigned the integer 2 since it is second in the sequence. We next exploit a property that stems from the way most websites are structured to get similarity and locality. Most websites have a template with a set of links from each page in the site to a fixed set of pages on the site (such as its copyright notice, terms of use, and so on). In this case, the rows corresponding to pages in a website will have many table entries in common. Moreover, under the lexicographic ordering of URLs, it is very likely that the pages from a website appear as contiguous rows in the table.  Figure 20.6: A four-row segment of the table of links. We adopt the following strategy: we walk down the table, encoding each table row in terms of the seven preceding rows. In the example of Figure 20.6, we could encode the fourth row as ``the same as the row at offset 2 (meaning, two rows earlier in the table), with 9 replaced by 8''. This requires the specification of the offset, the integer(s) dropped (in this case 9) and the integer(s) added (in this case 8). The use of only the seven preceding rows has two advantages: (i) the offset can be expressed with only 3 bits; this choice is optimized empirically (the reason for seven and not eight preceding rows is the subject of Exercise 20.4) and (ii) fixing the maximum offset to a small value like seven avoids having to perform an expensive search among many candidate prototypes in terms of which to express the current row. What if none of the preceding seven rows is a good prototype for expressing the current row? This would happen, for instance, at each boundary between different websites as we walk down the rows of the table. In this case we simply express the row as starting from the empty set and ``adding in'' each integer in that row. By using gap encodings to store the gaps (rather than the actual integers) in each row, and encoding these gaps tightly based on the distribution of their values, we obtain further space reduction. In experiments mentioned in Section 20.5 , the series of techniques outlined here appears to use as few as 3 bits per link, on average - a dramatic reduction from the 64 required in the naive representation. While these ideas give us a representation of sizable web graphs that comfortably fit in memory, we still need to support connectivity queries. What is entailed in retrieving from this representation the set of links from a page? First, we need an index lookup from (a hash of) the URL to its row number in the table. Next, we need to reconstruct these entries, which may be encoded in terms of entries in other rows. This entails following the offsets to reconstruct these other rows - a process that in principle could lead through many levels of indirection. In practice however, this does not happen very often. A heuristic for controlling this can be introduced into the construction of the table: when examining the preceding seven rows as candidates from which to model the current row, we demand a threshold of similarity between the current row and the candidate prototype. This threshold must be chosen with care. If the threshold is set too high, we seldom use prototypes and express many rows afresh. If the threshold is too low, most rows get expressed in terms of prototypes, so that at query time the reconstruction of a row leads to many levels of indirection through preceding prototypes. Exercises. We noted that expressing a row in terms of one of seven preceding rows allowed us to use no more than three bits to specify which of the preceding rows we are using as prototype. Why seven and not eight preceding rows? (Hint: consider the case when none of the preceding seven rows is a good prototype.) We noted that for the scheme in Section 20.4 , decoding the links incident on a URL could result in many levels of indirection. Construct an example in which the number of levels of indirection grows linearly with the number of URLs.

This result has generally been confirmed in more recent work (MacFarlane et al., 2000). But the outcome depends on the details of the distributed system; at least one thread of work has reached the opposite conclusion (Ribeiro-Neto and Barbosa, 1998, Badue et al., 2001).

iir_21	Link analysis The analysis of hyperlinks and the graph structure of the Web has been instrumental in the development of web search. In this chapter we focus on the use of hyperlinks for ranking web search results. Such link analysis is one of many factors considered by web search engines in computing a composite score for a web page on any given query. We begin by reviewing some basics of the Web as a graph in Section 21.1 , then proceed to the technical development of the elements of link analysis for ranking. Link analysis for web search has intellectual antecedents in the field of citation analysis, aspects of which overlap with an area known as bibliometrics. These disciplines seek to quantify the influence of scholarly articles by analyzing the pattern of citations amongst them. Much as citations represent the conferral of authority from a scholarly article to others, link analysis on the Web treats hyperlinks from a web page to another as a conferral of authority. Clearly, not every citation or hyperlink implies such authority conferral; for this reason, simply measuring the quality of a web page by the number of in-links (citations from other pages) is not robust enough. For instance, one may contrive to set up multiple web pages pointing to a target web page, with the intent of artificially boosting the latter's tally of in-links. This phenomenon is referred to as link spam . Nevertheless, the phenomenon of citation is prevalent and dependable enough that it is feasible for web search engines to derive useful signals for ranking from more sophisticated link analysis. Link analysis also proves to be a useful indicator of what page(s) to crawl next while crawling the web; this is done by using link analysis to guide the priority assignment in the front queues of Chapter 20 . Section 21.1 develops the basic ideas underlying the use of the web graph in link analysis. and 21.3 then develop two distinct methods for link analysis, PageRank and HITS.

iir_21_1	The Web as a graph 19.2.1 19.2 The anchor text pointing to page B is a good description of page B. The hyperlink from A to B represents an endorsement of page B, by the creator of page A. This is not always the case; for instance, many links amongst pages within a single website stem from the user of a common template. For instance, most corporate websites have a pointer from every page to a page containing a copyright notice - this is clearly not an endorsement. Accordingly, implementations of link analysis algorithms will typical discount such ``internal'' links.   Subsections Anchor text and the web graph
iir_21_1_1	Anchor text and the web graph Journal of the ACM. http://www.acm.org/jacm/ Journal of the ACM. http://www.acm.org/jacm/ The Web is full of instances where the page B does not provide an accurate description of itself. In many cases this is a matter of how the publishers of page B choose to present themselves; this is especially common with corporate web pages, where a web presence is a marketing statement. For example, at the time of the writing of this book the home page of the IBM corporation (http://www.ibm.com) did not contain the term computer anywhere in its HTML code, despite the fact that IBM is widely viewed as the world's largest computer maker. Similarly, the HTML code for the home page of Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com) does not at this time contain the word portal. Thus, there is often a gap between the terms in a web page, and how web users would describe that web page. Consequently, web searchers need not use the terms in a page to query for it. In addition, many web pages are rich in graphics and images, and/or embed their text in these images; in such cases, the HTML parsing performed when crawling will not extract text that is useful for indexing these pages. The ``standard IR'' approach to this would be to use the methods outlined in Chapter 9 and Section 12.4 . The insight behind anchor text is that such methods can be supplanted by anchor text, thereby tapping the power of the community of web page authors. The fact that the anchors of many hyperlinks pointing to http://www.ibm.com include the word computer can be exploited by web search engines. For instance, the anchor text terms can be included as terms under which to index the target web page. Thus, the postings for the term computer would include the document http://www.ibm.com and that for the term portal would include the document http://www.yahoo.com, using a special indicator to show that these terms occur as anchor (rather than in-page) text. As with in-page terms, anchor text terms are generally weighted based on frequency, with a penalty for terms that occur very often (the most common terms in anchor text across the Web are Click and here, using methods very similar to idf). The actual weighting of terms is determined by machine-learned scoring, as in Section 15.4.1 ; current web search engines appear to assign a substantial weighting to anchor text terms. The use of anchor text has some interesting side-effects. Searching for big blue on most web search engines returns the home page of the IBM corporation as the top hit; this is consistent with the popular nickname that many people use to refer to IBM. On the other hand, there have been (and continue to be) many instances where derogatory anchor text such as evil empire leads to somewhat unexpected results on querying for these terms on web search engines. This phenomenon has been exploited in orchestrated campaigns against specific sites. Such orchestrated anchor text may be a form of spamming, since a website can create misleading anchor text pointing to itself, to boost its ranking on selected query terms. Detecting and combating such systematic abuse of anchor text is another form of spam detection that web search engines perform. The window of text surrounding anchor text (sometimes referred to as extended anchor text) is often usable in the same manner as anchor text itself; consider for instance the fragment of web text there is good discussion of vedic scripture here. This has been considered in a number of settings and the useful width of this window has been studied; see Section 21.4 for references. Exercises. Is it always possible to follow directed edges (hyperlinks) in the web graph from any node (web page) to any other? Why or why not? Find an instance of misleading anchor-text on the Web. Given the collection of anchor-text phrases for a web page , suggest a heuristic for choosing one term or phrase from this collection that is most descriptive of . Does your heuristic in the previous exercise take into account a single domain repeating anchor text for from multiple pages in ?
iir_21_2	PageRank  PageRank 6.3 7.2.2 15.4.1 Consider a random surfer who begins at a web page (a node of the web graph) and executes a random walk on the Web as follows. At each time step, the surfer proceeds from his current page A to a randomly chosen web page that A hyperlinks to. Figure 21.1 shows the surfer at a node A, out of which there are three hyperlinks to nodes B, C and D; the surfer proceeds at the next time step to one of these three nodes, with equal probabilities 1/3.  Figure 21.1: The random surfer at node A proceeds with probability 1/3 to each of B, C and D. As the surfer proceeds in this random walk from node to node, he visits some nodes more often than others; intuitively, these are nodes with many links coming in from other frequently visited nodes. The idea behind PageRank is that pages visited more often in this walk are more important. What if the current location of the surfer, the node A, has no out-links? To address this we introduce an additional operation for our random surfer: the teleport operation. In the teleport operation the surfer jumps from a node to any other node in the web graph. This could happen because he types an address into the URL bar of his browser. The destination of a teleport operation is modeled as being chosen uniformly at random from all web pages. In other words, if is the total number of nodes in the web graph, the teleport operation takes the surfer to each node with probability . The surfer would also teleport to his present position with probability . In assigning a PageRank score to each node of the web graph, we use the teleport operation in two ways: (1) When at a node with no out-links, the surfer invokes the teleport operation. (2) At any node that has outgoing links, the surfer invokes the teleport operation with probability and the standard random walk (follow an out-link chosen uniformly at random as in Figure 21.1 ) with probability , where is a fixed parameter chosen in advance. Typically, might be 0.1. In Section 21.2.1 , we will use the theory of Markov chains to argue that when the surfer follows this combined process (random walk plus teleport) he visits each node of the web graph a fixed fraction of the time that depends on (1) the structure of the web graph and (2) the value of . We call this value the PageRank of and will show how to compute this value in Section 21.2.2 .   Subsections Markov chains Definition: The PageRank computation Topic-specific PageRank
iir_21_2_1	Markov chains discrete-time stochastic process:  states A Markov chain is characterized by an transition probability matrix each of whose entries is in the interval ; the entries in each row of add up to 1. The Markov chain can be in one of the states at any given time-step; then, the entry tells us the probability that the state at the next time-step is , conditioned on the current state being . Each entry is known as a transition probability and depends only on the current state ; this is known as the Markov property. Thus, by the Markov property, (251)   (252)  252  stochastic matrix  principal left eigenvector In a Markov chain, the probability distribution of next states for a Markov chain depends only on the current state, and not on how the Markov chain arrived at the current state. Figure 21.2 shows a simple Markov chain with three states. From the middle state A, we proceed with (equal) probabilities of 0.5 to either B or C. From either B or C, we proceed with probability 1 to A. The transition probability matrix of this Markov chain is then  (253)   Figure 21.2: A simple Markov chain with three states; the numbers on the links indicate the transition probabilities. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector : a vector all of whose entries are in the interval , and the entries add up to 1. An -dimensional probability vector each of whose components corresponds to one of the states of a Markov chain can be viewed as a probability distribution over its states. For our simple Markov chain of Figure 21.2 , the probability vector would have 3 components that sum to 1. We can view a random surfer on the web graph as a Markov chain, with one state for each web page, and each transition probability representing the probability of moving from one web page to another. The teleport operation contributes to these transition probabilities. The adjacency matrix of the web graph is defined as follows: if there is a hyperlink from page to page , then , otherwise . We can readily derive the transition probability matrix for our Markov chain from the matrix : If a row of has no 1's, then replace each element by 1/N. For all other rows proceed as follows. Divide each 1 in by the number of 1's in its row. Thus, if there is a row with three 1's, then each of them is replaced by . Multiply the resulting matrix by . Add to every entry of the resulting matrix, to obtain . We can depict the probability distribution of the surfer's position at any time by a probability vector . At the surfer may begin at a state whose corresponding entry in is 1 while all others are zero. By definition, the surfer's distribution at is given by the probability vector ; at by , and so on. We will detail this process in Section 21.2.2 . We can thus compute the surfer's distribution over the states at any time, given only the initial distribution and the transition probability matrix . If a Markov chain is allowed to run for many time steps, each state is visited at a (different) frequency that depends on the structure of the Markov chain. In our running analogy, the surfer visits certain web pages (say, popular news home pages) more often than other pages. We now make this intuition precise, establishing conditions under which such the visit frequency converges to fixed, steady-state quantity. Following this, we set the PageRank of each node to this steady-state visit frequency and show how it can be computed.   Subsections Definition:
iir_21_2_2	The PageRank computation 214     (255)  The entries in the principal eigenvector are the steady-state probabilities of the random walk with teleporting, and thus the PageRank values for the corresponding web pages. We may interpret Equation 255 as follows: if is the probability distribution of the surfer across the web pages, he remains in the steady-state distribution . Given that is the steady-state distribution, we have that , so 1 is an eigenvalue of P. Thus if we were to compute the principal left eigenvector of the matrix -- the one with eigenvalue 1 -- we would have computed the PageRank values. There are many algorithms available for computing left eigenvectors; the references at the end of Chapter 18 and the present chapter are a guide to these. We give here a rather elementary method, sometimes known as power iteration. If is the initial distribution over the states, then the distribution at time is . As grows large, we would expect that the distribution is very similar to the distribution , since for large we would expect the Markov chain to attain its steady state. By Theorem 21.2.1 this is independent of the initial distribution . The power iteration method simulates the surfer's walk: begin at a state and run the walk for a large number of steps , keeping track of the visit frequencies for each of the states. After a large number of steps , these frequencies ``settle down'' so that the variation in the computed frequencies is below some predetermined threshold. We declare these tabulated frequencies to be the PageRank values. We consider the web graph in Exercise 21.2.3 with . The transition probability matrix of the surfer's walk with teleportation is then  (256)    (257)   (258)  21.3  Figure 21.3: The sequence of probability vectors. Continuing for several steps, we see that the distribution converges to the steady state of . In this simple example, we may directly calculate this steady-state probability distribution by observing the symmetry of the Markov chain: states 1 and 3 are symmetric, as evident from the fact that the first and third rows of the transition probability matrix in Equation 256 are identical. Postulating, then, that they both have the same steady-state probability and denoting this probability by , we know that the steady-state distribution is of the form . Now, using the identity , we solve a simple linear equation to obtain and consequently, . The PageRank values of pages (and the implicit ordering amongst them) are independent of any query a user might pose; PageRank is thus a query-independent measure of the static quality of each web page (recall such static quality measures from Section 7.1.4 ). On the other hand, the relative ordering of pages should, intuitively, depend on the query being served. For this reason, search engines use static quality measures such as PageRank as just one of many factors in scoring a web page on a query. Indeed, the relative contribution of PageRank to the overall score may again be determined by machine-learned scoring as in Section 15.4.1 .   Worked example. Consider the graph in Figure 21.4 . For a teleportation rate of 0.14 its (stochastic) transition probability matrix is: (259)   (260)  21.4      End worked example.
iir_21_2_3	Topic-specific PageRank non-uniformly Suppose our random surfer, endowed with a teleport operation as before, teleports to a random web page on the topic of sports instead of teleporting to a uniformly chosen random web page. We will not focus on how we collect all web pages on the topic of sports; in fact, we only need a non-zero subset of sports-related web pages, so that the teleport operation is feasible. This may be obtained, for instance, from a manually built directory of sports pages such as the open directory project (http://www.dmoz.org/) or that of Yahoo. Provided the set of sports-related pages is non-empty, it follows that there is a non-empty set of web pages over which the random walk has a steady-state distribution; let us denote this sports PageRank distribution by . For web pages not in , we set the PageRank values to zero. We call the topic-specific PageRank for sports.  Topic-specific PageRank.In this example we consider a user whose interests are 60% sports and 40% politics. If the teleportation probability is 10%, this user is modeled as teleporting 6% to sports pages and 4% to politics pages. We do not demand that teleporting takes the random surfer to a uniformly chosen sports page; the distribution over teleporting targets could in fact be arbitrary. In like manner we can envision topic-specific PageRank distributions for each of several topics such as science, religion, politics and so on. Each of these distributions assigns to each web page a PageRank value in the interval . For a user interested in only a single topic from among these topics, we may invoke the corresponding PageRank distribution when scoring and ranking search results. This gives us the potential of considering settings in which the search engine knows what topic a user is interested in. This may happen because users either explicitly register their interests, or because the system learns by observing each user's behavior over time. But what if a user is known to have a mixture of interests from multiple topics? For instance, a user may have an interest mixture (or profile) that is 60% sports and 40% politics; can we compute a personalized PageRank for this user? At first glance, this appears daunting: how could we possibly compute a different PageRank distribution for each user profile (with, potentially, infinitely many possible profiles)? We can in fact address this provided we assume that an individual's interests can be well-approximated as a linear combination of a small number of topic page distributions. A user with this mixture of interests could teleport as follows: determine first whether to teleport to the set of known sports pages, or to the set of known politics pages. This choice is made at random, choosing sports pages 60% of the time and politics pages 40% of the time. Once we choose that a particular teleport step is to (say) a random sports page, we choose a web page in uniformly at random to teleport to. This in turn leads to an ergodic Markov chain with a steady-state distribution that is personalized to this user's preferences over topics (see Exercise 21.2.3 ). While this idea has intuitive appeal, its implementation appears cumbersome: it seems to demand that for each user, we compute a transition probability matrix and compute its steady-state distribution. We are rescued by the fact that the evolution of the probability distribution over the states of a Markov chain can be viewed as a linear system. In Exercise 21.2.3 we will show that it is not necessary to compute a PageRank vector for every distinct combination of user interests over topics; the personalized PageRank vector for any user can be expressed as a linear combination of the underlying topic-specific PageRanks. For instance, the personalized PageRank vector for the user whose interests are 60% sports and 40% politics can be computed as (261)    Exercises. Write down the transition probability matrix for the example in Figure 21.2 . Consider a web graph with three nodes 1, 2 and 3. The links are as follows: . Write down the transition probability matrices for the surfer's walk with teleporting, for the following three values of the teleport probability: (a) ; (b) and (c) . A user of a browser can, in addition to clicking a hyperlink on the page he is currently browsing, use the back button to go back to the page from which he arrived at . Can such a user of back buttons be modeled as a Markov chain? How would we model repeated invocations of the back button? Consider a Markov chain with three states A, B and C, and transition probabilities as follows. From state A, the next state is B with probability 1. From B, the next state is either A with probability , or state C with probability . From C the next state is A with probability 1. For what values of is this Markov chain ergodic? Show that for any directed graph, the Markov chain induced by a random walk with the teleport operation is ergodic. Show that the PageRank of every page is at least . What does this imply about the difference in PageRank values (over the various pages) as becomes close to 1? For the data in Example 21.2.2, write a small routine or use a scientific calculator to compute the PageRank values stated in Equation 260. Suppose that the web graph is stored on disk as an adjacency list, in such a way that you may only query for the out-neighbors of pages in the order in which they are stored. You cannot load the graph in main memory but you may do multiple reads over the full graph. Write the algorithm for computing the PageRank in this setting. Recall the sets and introduced near the beginning of Section 21.2.3 . How does the set relate to ? Is the set always the set of all web pages? Why or why not? Is the sports PageRank of any page in at least as large as its PageRank? Consider a setting where we have two topic-specific PageRank values for each web page: a sports PageRank , and a politics PageRank . Let be the (common) teleportation probability used in computing both sets of topic-specific PageRanks. For , consider a user whose interest profile is divided between a fraction in sports and a fraction in politics. Show that the user's personalized PageRank is the steady-state distribution of a random walk in which - on a teleport step - the walk teleports to a sports page with probability and to a politics page with probability . Show that the Markov chain corresponding to the walk in Exercise 21.2.3 is ergodic and hence the user's personalized PageRank can be obtained by computing the steady-state distribution of this Markov chain. Show that in the steady-state distribution of Exercise 21.2.3, the steady-state probability for any web page equals .
iir_21_3	Hubs and Authorities two  hub score  authority score This approach stems from a particular insight into the creation of web pages, that there are two primary kinds of web pages useful as results for broad-topic searches. By a broad topic search we mean an informational query such as "I wish to learn about leukemia". There are authoritative sources of information on the topic; in this case, the National Cancer Institute's page on leukemia would be such a page. We will call such pages authorities; in the computation we are about to describe, they are the pages that will emerge with high authority scores. On the other hand, there are many pages on the Web that are hand-compiled lists of links to authoritative web pages on a specific topic. These hub pages are not in themselves authoritative sources of topic-specific information, but rather compilations that someone with an interest in the topic has spent time putting together. The approach we will take, then, is to use these hub pages to discover the authority pages. In the computation we now develop, these hub pages are the pages that will emerge with high hub scores. A good hub page is one that points to many good authorities; a good authority page is one that is pointed to by many good hub pages. We thus appear to have a circular definition of hubs and authorities; we will turn this into an iterative computation. Suppose that we have a subset of the web containing good hub and authority pages, together with the hyperlinks amongst them. We will iteratively compute a hub score and an authority score for every web page in this subset, deferring the discussion of how we pick this subset until Section 21.3.1 . For a web page in our subset of the web, we use to denote its hub score and its authority score. Initially, we set for all nodes . We also denote by the existence of a hyperlink from to . The core of the iterative algorithm is a pair of updates to the hub and authority scores of all pages given by Equation 262, which capture the intuitive notions that good hubs point to good authorities and that good authorities are pointed to by good hubs.  (262) (263)   262    What happens as we perform these updates iteratively, recomputing hub scores, then new authority scores based on the recomputed hub scores, and so on? Let us recast the equations Equation 262 into matrix-vector form. Let and denote the vectors of all hub and all authority scores respectively, for the pages in our subset of the web graph. Let denote the adjacency matrix of the subset of the web graph that we are dealing with: is a square matrix with one row and one column for each page in the subset. The entry is 1 if there is a hyperlink from page to page , and 0 otherwise. Then, we may write Equation 262 (264) (265)     264 264 264  (266) (267)   266 18.1   266    (268) (269)       This leads to some key consequences: The iterative updates in Equation 262 (or equivalently, Equation 264), if scaled by the appropriate eigenvalues, are equivalent to the power iteration method for computing the eigenvectors of and . Provided that the principal eigenvalue of is unique, the iteratively computed entries of and settle into unique steady-state values determined by the entries of and hence the link structure of the graph. In computing these eigenvector entries, we are not restricted to using the power iteration method; indeed, we could use any fast method for computing the principal eigenvector of a stochastic matrix. The resulting computation thus takes the following form: Assemble the target subset of web pages, form the graph induced by their hyperlinks and compute and . Compute the principal eigenvectors of and to form the vector of hub scores and authority scores . Output the top-scoring hubs and the top-scoring authorities.  HITS Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search Worked example. Assuming the query jaguar and double-weighting of links whose anchors contain the query word, the matrix for Figure 21.4 is as follows: (270)  The hub and authority vectors are:  (271)   (272)  Here, is the main authority - two hubs ( and ) are pointing to it via highly weighted jaguar links. End worked example. Since the iterative updates captured the intuition of good hubs and good authorities, the high-scoring pages we output would give us good hubs and authorities from the target subset of web pages. In Section 21.3.1 we describe the remaining detail: how do we gather a target subset of web pages around a topic such as leukemia?   Subsections Choosing the subset of the Web
iir_21_3_1	Choosing the subset of the Web In assembling a subset of web pages around a topic such as leukemia, we must cope with the fact that good authority pages may not contain the specific query term leukemia. This is especially true, as we noted in Section 21.1.1 , when an authority page uses its web presence to project a certain marketing image. For instance, many pages on the IBM website are authoritative sources of information on computer hardware, even though these pages may not contain the term computer or hardware. However, a hub compiling computer hardware resources is likely to use these terms and also link to the relevant pages on the IBM website. Building on these observations, the following procedure has been suggested for compiling the subset of the Web for which to compute hub and authority scores. Given a query (say leukemia), use a text index to get all pages containing leukemia. Call this the root set of pages. Build the base set of pages, to include the root set as well as any page that either links to a page in the root set, or is linked to by a page in the root set. We then use the base set for computing hub and authority scores. The base set is constructed in this manner for three reasons: A good authority page may not contain the query text (such as computer hardware). If the text query manages to capture a good hub page in the root set, then the inclusion of all pages linked to by any page in the root set will capture all the good authorities linked to by in the base set. Conversely, if the text query manages to capture a good authority page in the root set, then the inclusion of pages which point to will bring other good hubs into the base set. In other words, the ``expansion'' of the root set into the base set enriches the common pool of good hubs and authorities. Running HITS across a variety of queries reveals some interesting insights about link analysis. Frequently, the documents that emerge as top hubs and authorities include languages other than the language of the query. These pages were presumably drawn into the base set, following the assembly of the root set. Thus, some elements of cross-language retrieval (where a query in one language retrieves documents in another) are evident here; interestingly, this cross-language effect resulted purely from link analysis, with no linguistic translation taking place. We conclude this section with some notes on implementing this algorithm. The root set consists of all pages matching the text query; in fact, implementations (see the references in Section 21.4 ) suggest that it suffices to use 200 or so web pages for the root set, rather than all pages matching the text query. Any algorithm for computing eigenvectors may be used for computing the hub/authority score vector. In fact, we need not compute the exact values of these scores; it suffices to know the relative values of the scores so that we may identify the top hubs and authorities. To this end, it is possible that a small number of iterations of the power iteration method yields the relative ordering of the top hubs and authorities. Experiments have suggested that in practice, about five iterations of Equation 262 yield fairly good results. Moreover, since the link structure of the web graph is fairly sparse (the average web page links to about ten others), we do not perform these as matrix-vector products but rather as additive updates as in Equation 262.  Figure: A sample run of HITS on the query japan elementary schools. Figure 21.6 shows the results of running HITS on the query japan elementary schools. The figure shows the top hubs and authorities; each row lists the title tag from the corresponding HTML page. Because the resulting string is not necessarily in Latin characters, the resulting print is (in many cases) a string of gibberish. Each of these corresponds to a web page that does not use Latin characters, in this case very likely pages in Japanese. There also appear to be pages in other non-English languages, which seems surprising given that the query string is in English. In fact, this result is emblematic of the functioning of HITS - following the assembly of the root set, the (English) query string is ignored. The base set is likely to contain pages in other languages, for instance if an English-language hub page links to the Japanese-language home pages of Japanese elementary schools. Because the subsequent computation of the top hubs and authorities is entirely link-based, some of these non-English pages will appear among the top hubs and authorities. Exercises. If all the hub and authority scores are initialized to 1, what is the hub/authority score of a node after one iteration? How would you interpret the entries of the matrices and ? What is the connection to the co-occurrence matrix in Chapter 18 ? What are the principal eigenvalues of and ? Figure: Web graph for Exercise 21.3.1 . For the web graph in Figure 21.7 , compute PageRank, hub and authority scores for each of the three pages. Also give the relative ordering of the 3 nodes for each of these scores, indicating any ties. PageRank: Assume that at each step of the PageRank random walk, we teleport to a random page with probability 0.1, with a uniform distribution over which particular page we teleport to. Hubs/Authorities: Normalize the hub (authority) scores so that the maximum hub (authority) score is 1. Hint 1: Using symmetries to simplify and solving with linear equations might be easier than using iterative methods. Hint 2: Provide the relative ordering (indicating any ties) of the three nodes for each of the three scoring measures.
iir_21_4	References and further reading Garfield (1955) is seminal in the science of citation analysis. This was built on by Pinski and Narin (1976) to develop a journal influence weight, whose definition is remarkably similar to that of the PageRank measure. The use of anchor text as an aid to searching and ranking stems from the work of McBryan (1994). Extended anchor-text was implicit in his work, with systematic experiments reported in Chakrabarti et al. (1998). Kemeny and Snell (1976) is a classic text on Markov chains. The PageRank measure was developed in Brin and Page (1998) and in Page et al. (1998). A number of methods for the fast computation of PageRank values are surveyed in Berkhin (2005) and in Langville and Meyer (2006); the former also details how the PageRank eigenvector solution may be viewed as solving a linear system, leading to one way of solving Exercise 21.2.3 . The effect of the teleport probability has been studied by Baeza-Yates et al. (2005) and by Boldi et al. (2005). Topic-specific PageRank and variants were developed in Haveliwala (2002), Haveliwala (2003) and in Jeh and Widom (2003). Berkhin (2006a) develops an alternate view of topic-specific PageRank. Ng et al. (2001b) suggests that the PageRank score assignment is more robust than HITS in the sense that scores are less sensitive to small changes in graph topology. However, it has also been noted that the teleport operation contributes significantly to PageRank's robustness in this sense. Both PageRank and HITS can be ``spammed'' by the orchestrated insertion of links into the web graph; indeed, the Web is known to have such link farms that collude to increase the score assigned to certain pages by various link analysis algorithms. The HITS algorithm is due to Kleinberg (1999). Chakrabarti et al. (1998) developed variants that weighted links in the iterative computation based on the presence of query terms in the pages being linked and compared these to results from several web search engines. Bharat and Henzinger (1998) further developed these and other heuristics, showing that certain combinations outperformed the basic HITS algorithm. Borodin et al. (2001) provides a systematic study of several variants of the HITS algorithm. Ng et al. (2001b) introduces a notion of stability for link analysis, arguing that small changes to link topology should not lead to significant changes in the ranked list of results for a query. Numerous other variants of HITS have been developed by a number of authors, the best know of which is perhaps SALSA (Lempel and Moran, 2000).

iir_2_1_1	Obtaining the character sequence in a document Digital documents that are the input to an indexing process are typically bytes in a file or on a web server. The first step of processing is to convert this byte sequence into a linear sequence of characters. For the case of plain English text in ASCII encoding, this is trivial. But often things get much more complex. The sequence of characters may be encoded by one of various single byte or multibyte encoding schemes, such as Unicode UTF-8, or various national or vendor-specific standards. We need to determine the correct encoding. This can be regarded as a machine learning classification problem, as discussed in Chapter 13 ,but is often handled by heuristic methods, user selection, or by using provided document metadata. Once the encoding is determined, we decode the byte sequence to a character sequence. We might save the choice of encoding because it gives some evidence about what language the document is written in. The characters may have to be decoded out of some binary representation like Microsoft Word DOC files and/or a compressed format such as zip files. Again, we must determine the document format, and then an appropriate decoder has to be used. Even for plain text documents, additional decoding may need to be done. In XML documents xmlbasic, character entities, such as  amp;, need to be decoded to give the correct character, namely   for  amp;. Finally, the textual part of the document may need to be extracted out of other material that will not be processed. This might be the desired handling for XML files, if the markup is going to be ignored; we would almost certainly want to do this with postscript or PDF files. We will not deal further with these issues in this book, and will assume henceforth that our documents are a list of characters. Commercial products usually need to support a broad range of document types and encodings, since users want things to just work with their data as is. Often, they just think of documents as text inside applications and are not even aware of how it is encoded on disk. This problem is usually solved by licensing a software library that handles decoding document formats and character encodings. The idea that text is a linear sequence of characters is also called into question by some writing systems, such as Arabic, where text takes on some two dimensional and mixed order characteristics, as shown in and 2.2 . But, despite some complicated writing system conventions, there is an underlying sequence of sounds being represented and hence an essentially linear structure remains, and this is what is represented in the digital representation of Arabic, as shown in Figure 2.1 .  An example of a vocalized Modern Standard Arabic word.The writing is from right to left and letters undergo complex mutations as they are combined. The representation of short vowels (here, /i/ and /u/) and the final /n/ (nunation) departs from strict linearity by being represented as diacritics above and below letters. Nevertheless, the represented text is still clearly a linear ordering of characters representing sounds. Full vocalization, as here, normally appears only in the Koran and children's books. Day-to-day text is unvocalized (short vowels are not represented but the letter for a would still appear) or partially vocalized, with short vowels inserted in places where the writer perceives ambiguities. These choices add further complexities to indexing.  The conceptual linear order of characters is not necessarily the order that you see on the page. In languages that are written right-to-left, such as Hebrew and Arabic, it is quite common to also have left-to-right text interspersed, such as numbers and dollar amounts. With modern Unicode representation concepts, the order of characters in files matches the conceptual order, and the reversal of displayed characters is handled by the rendering system, but this may not be true for documents in older encodings.
iir_2_1_2	Choosing a document unit The next phase is to determine what the document unit for indexing is. Thus far we have assumed that documents are fixed units for the purposes of indexing. For example, we take each file in a folder as a document. But there are many cases in which you might want to do something different. A traditional Unix (mbox-format) email file stores a sequence of email messages (an email folder) in one file, but you might wish to regard each email message as a separate document. Many email messages now contain attached documents, and you might then want to regard the email message and each contained attachment as separate documents. If an email message has an attached zip file, you might want to decode the zip file and regard each file it contains as a separate document. Going in the opposite direction, various pieces of web software (such as latex2html) take things that you might regard as a single document (e.g., a Powerpoint file or a LATEX document) and split them into separate HTML pages for each slide or subsection, stored as separate files. In these cases, you might want to combine multiple files into a single document. More generally, for very long documents, the issue of indexing granularity arises. For a collection of books, it would usually be a bad idea to index an entire book as a document. A search for Chinese toys might bring up a book that mentions China in the first chapter and toys in the last chapter, but this does not make it relevant to the query. Instead, we may well wish to index each chapter or paragraph as a mini-document. Matches are then more likely to be relevant, and since the documents are smaller it will be much easier for the user to find the relevant passages in the document. But why stop there? We could treat individual sentences as mini-documents. It becomes clear that there is a precisionrecall tradeoff here. If the units get too small, we are likely to miss important passages because terms were distributed over several mini-documents, while if units are too large we tend to get spurious matches and the relevant information is hard for the user to find. The problems with large document units can be alleviated by use of explicit or implicit proximity search ( and 7.2.2 ), and the tradeoffs in resulting system performance that we are hinting at are discussed in Chapter 8 . The issue of index granularity, and in particular a need to simultaneously index documents at multiple levels of granularity, appears prominently in XML retrieval, and is taken up again in Chapter 10 . An IR system should be designed to offer choices of granularity. For this choice to be made well, the person who is deploying the system must have a good understanding of the document collection, the users, and their likely information needs and usage patterns. For now, we will henceforth assume that a suitable size document unit has been chosen, together with an appropriate way of dividing or aggregating files, if needed.
iir_2_2	Determining the vocabulary of terms   Subsections Tokenization Dropping common terms: stop words Normalization (equivalence classing of terms) Accents and diacritics. Capitalization/case-folding. Other issues in English. Other languages. Stemming and lemmatization
iir_2_2_1	Tokenization Given a character sequence and a defined document unit, tokenization is the task of chopping it up into pieces, called tokens , perhaps at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation. Here is an example of tokenization: Input: Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears; Output:   token   type  term 2.2.3  2.2.2  sleep perchance dream The major question of the tokenization phase is what are the correct tokens to use? In this example, it looks fairly trivial: you chop on whitespace and throw away punctuation characters. This is a starting point, but even for English there are a number of tricky cases. For example, what do you do about the various uses of the apostrophe for possession and contractions? Mr. O'Neill thinks that the boys' stories about Chile's capital aren't amusing. O'Neill ? aren't ?      These issues of tokenization are language-specific. It thus requires the language of the document to be known. Language identification based on classifiers that use short character subsequences as features is highly effective; most languages have distinctive signature patterns (see page 2.5 for references). For most languages and particular domains within them there are unusual specific tokens that we wish to recognize as terms, such as the programming languages C++ and C#, aircraft names like B-52, or a T.V. show name such as M*A*S*H - which is sufficiently integrated into popular culture that you find usages such as M*A*S*H-style hospitals. Computer technology has introduced new types of character sequences that a tokenizer should probably tokenize as a single token, including email addresses (jblack@mail.yahoo.com), web URLs (http://stuff.big.com/new/specials.html), numeric IP addresses (142.32.48.231), package tracking numbers (1Z9999W99845399981), and more. One possible solution is to omit from indexing tokens such as monetary amounts, numbers, and URLs, since their presence greatly expands the size of the vocabulary. However, this comes at a large cost in restricting what people can search for. For instance, people might want to search in a bug database for the line number where an error occurs. Items such as the date of an email, which have a clear semantic type, are often indexed separately as document metadata parametricsection. In English, hyphenation is used for various purposes ranging from splitting up vowels in words (co-education) to joining nouns as names (Hewlett-Packard) to a copyediting device to show word grouping (the hold-him-back-and-drag-him-away maneuver). It is easy to feel that the first example should be regarded as one token (and is indeed more commonly written as just coeducation), the last should be separated into words, and that the middle case is unclear. Handling hyphens automatically can thus be complex: it can either be done as a classification problem, or more commonly by some heuristic rules, such as allowing short hyphenated prefixes on words, but not longer hyphenated forms. Conceptually, splitting on white space can also split what should be regarded as a single token. This occurs most commonly with names (San Francisco, Los Angeles) but also with borrowed foreign phrases (au fait) and compounds that are sometimes written as a single word and sometimes space separated (such as white space vs. whitespace). Other cases with internal spaces that we might wish to regard as a single token include phone numbers ((800) 234-2333) and dates (Mar 11, 1983). Splitting tokens on spaces can cause bad retrieval results, for example, if a search for York University mainly returns documents containing New York University. The problems of hyphens and non-separating whitespace can even interact. Advertisements for air fares frequently contain items like San Francisco-Los Angeles, where simply doing whitespace splitting would give unfortunate results. In such cases, issues of tokenization interact with handling phrase queries (which we discuss in Section 2.4 (page )), particularly if we would like queries for all of lowercase, lower-case and lower case to return the same results. The last two can be handled by splitting on hyphens and using a phrase index. Getting the first case right would depend on knowing that it is sometimes written as two words and also indexing it in this way. One effective strategy in practice, which is used by some Boolean retrieval systems such as Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis (westlaw), is to encourage users to enter hyphens wherever they may be possible, and whenever there is a hyphenated form, the system will generalize the query to cover all three of the one word, hyphenated, and two word forms, so that a query for over-eager will search for over-eager OR ``over eager'' OR overeager. However, this strategy depends on user training, since if you query using either of the other two forms, you get no generalization. Each new language presents some new issues. For instance, French has a variant use of the apostrophe for a reduced definite article the before a word beginning with a vowel (e.g., l'ensemble) and has some uses of the hyphen with postposed clitic pronouns in imperatives and questions (e.g., donne-moi give me). Getting the first case correct will affect the correct indexing of a fair percentage of nouns and adjectives: you would want documents mentioning both l'ensemble and un ensemble to be indexed under ensemble. Other languages make the problem harder in new ways. German writes compound nouns without spaces (e.g., Computerlinguistik `computational linguistics'; Lebensversicherungsgesellschaftsangestellter `life insurance company employee'). Retrieval systems for German greatly benefit from the use of a compound-splitter module, which is usually implemented by seeing if a word can be subdivided into multiple words that appear in a vocabulary. This phenomenon reaches its limit case with major East Asian Languages (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai), where text is written without any spaces between words. An example is shown in Figure 2.3 . One approach here is to perform word segmentation as prior linguistic processing. Methods of word segmentation vary from having a large vocabulary and taking the longest vocabulary match with some heuristics for unknown words to the use of machine learning sequence models, such as hidden Markov models or conditional random fields, trained over hand-segmented words (see the references in Section 2.5 ). Since there are multiple possible segmentations of character sequences (see Figure 2.4 ), all such methods make mistakes sometimes, and so you are never guaranteed a consistent unique tokenization. The other approach is to abandon word-based indexing and to do all indexing via just short subsequences of characters (character -grams), regardless of whether particular sequences cross word boundaries or not. Three reasons why this approach is appealing are that an individual Chinese character is more like a syllable than a letter and usually has some semantic content, that most words are short (the commonest length is 2 characters), and that, given the lack of standardization of word breaking in the writing system, it is not always clear where word boundaries should be placed anyway. Even in English, some cases of where to put word boundaries are just orthographic conventions - think of notwithstanding vs. not to mention or into vs. on to - but people are educated to write the words with consistent use of spaces.  The standard unsegmented form of Chinese text using the simplified characters of mainland China.There is no whitespace between words, not even between sentences - the apparent space after the Chinese period ( ) is just a typographical illusion caused by placing the character on the left side of its square box. The first sentence is just words in Chinese characters with no spaces between them. The second and third sentences include Arabic numerals and punctuation breaking up the Chinese characters.  Ambiguities in Chinese word segmentation.The two characters can be treated as one word meaning `monk' or as a sequence of two words meaning `and' and `still'.
iir_2_2_2	Dropping common terms: stop words  Figure 2.5: A stop list of 25 semantically non-selective words which are common in Reuters-RCV1. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words . The general strategy for determining a stop list is to sort the terms by collection frequency (the total number of times each term appears in the document collection), and then to take the most frequent terms, often hand-filtered for their semantic content relative to the domain of the documents being indexed, as a stop list , the members of which are then discarded during indexing. An example of a stop list is shown in Figure 2.5 . Using a stop list significantly reduces the number of postings that a system has to store; we will present some statistics on this in Chapter 5 (see Table 5.1 , page 5.1 ). And a lot of the time not indexing stop words does little harm: keyword searches with terms like the and by don't seem very useful. However, this is not true for phrase searches. The phrase query ``President of the United States'', which contains two stop words, is more precise than President AND ``United States''. The meaning of flights to London is likely to be lost if the word to is stopped out. A search for Vannevar Bush's article As we may think will be difficult if the first three words are stopped out, and the system searches simply for documents containing the word think. Some special query types are disproportionately affected. Some song titles and well known pieces of verse consist entirely of words that are commonly on stop lists (To be or not to be, Let It Be, I don't want to be, ...). The general trend in IR systems over time has been from standard use of quite large stop lists (200-300 terms) to very small stop lists (7-12 terms) to no stop list whatsoever. Web search engines generally do not use stop lists. Some of the design of modern IR systems has focused precisely on how we can exploit the statistics of language so as to be able to cope with common words in better ways. We will show in Section 5.3 (page ) how good compression techniques greatly reduce the cost of storing the postings for common words. idf then discusses how standard term weighting leads to very common words having little impact on document rankings. Finally, Section 7.1.5 (page ) shows how an IR system with impact-sorted indexes can terminate scanning a postings list early when weights get small, and hence common words do not cause a large additional processing cost for the average query, even though postings lists for stop words are very long. So for most modern IR systems, the additional cost of including stop words is not that big - neither in terms of index size nor in terms of query processing time.
iir_2_2_3	Normalization (equivalence classing of terms) Having broken up our documents (and also our query) into tokens, the easy case is if tokens in the query just match tokens in the token list of the document. However, there are many cases when two character sequences are not quite the same but you would like a match to occur. For instance, if you search for USA, you might hope to also match documents containing U.S.A. Token normalization is the process of canonicalizing tokens so that matches occur despite superficial differences in the character sequences of the tokens. The most standard way to normalize is to implicitly create equivalence classes , which are normally named after one member of the set. For instance, if the tokens anti-discriminatory and antidiscriminatory are both mapped onto the term antidiscriminatory, in both the document text and queries, then searches for one term will retrieve documents that contain either. The advantage of just using mapping rules that remove characters like hyphens is that the equivalence classing to be done is implicit, rather than being fully calculated in advance: the terms that happen to become identical as the result of these rules are the equivalence classes. It is only easy to write rules of this sort that remove characters. Since the equivalence classes are implicit, it is not obvious when you might want to add characters. For instance, it would be hard to know to turn antidiscriminatory into anti-discriminatory.  Figure 2.6: An example of how asymmetric expansion of query terms can usefully model users' expectations. An alternative to creating equivalence classes is to maintain relations between unnormalized tokens. This method can be extended to hand-constructed lists of synonyms such as car and automobile, a topic we discuss further in Chapter 9 . These term relationships can be achieved in two ways. The usual way is to index unnormalized tokens and to maintain a query expansion list of multiple vocabulary entries to consider for a certain query term. A query term is then effectively a disjunction of several postings lists. The alternative is to perform the expansion during index construction. When the document contains automobile, we index it under car as well (and, usually, also vice-versa). Use of either of these methods is considerably less efficient than equivalence classing, as there are more postings to store and merge. The first method adds a query expansion dictionary and requires more processing at query time, while the second method requires more space for storing postings. Traditionally, expanding the space required for the postings lists was seen as more disadvantageous, but with modern storage costs, the increased flexibility that comes from distinct postings lists is appealing. These approaches are more flexible than equivalence classes because the expansion lists can overlap while not being identical. This means there can be an asymmetry in expansion. An example of how such an asymmetry can be exploited is shown in Figure 2.6 : if the user enters windows, we wish to allow matches with the capitalized Windows operating system, but this is not plausible if the user enters window, even though it is plausible for this query to also match lowercase windows. The best amount of equivalence classing or query expansion to do is a fairly open question. Doing some definitely seems a good idea. But doing a lot can easily have unexpected consequences of broadening queries in unintended ways. For instance, equivalence-classing U.S.A. and USA to the latter by deleting periods from tokens might at first seem very reasonable, given the prevalent pattern of optional use of periods in acronyms. However, if I put in as my query term C.A.T., I might be rather upset if it matches every appearance of the word cat in documents. Below we present some of the forms of normalization that are commonly employed and how they are implemented. In many cases they seem helpful, but they can also do harm. In fact, you can worry about many details of equivalence classing, but it often turns out that providing processing is done consistently to the query and to documents, the fine details may not have much aggregate effect on performance.

iir_2_2_4	Stemming and lemmatization For grammatical reasons, documents are going to use different forms of a word, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization. In many situations, it seems as if it would be useful for a search for one of these words to return documents that contain another word in the set. The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. For instance: am, are, is be car, cars, car's, cars' car the boy's cars are different colors the boy car be differ color  Stemming  Lemmatization  lemma saw s see saw The most common algorithm for stemming English, and one that has repeatedly been shown to be empirically very effective, is Porter's algorithm (Porter, 1980). The entire algorithm is too long and intricate to present here, but we will indicate its general nature. Porter's algorithm consists of 5 phases of word reductions, applied sequentially. Within each phase there are various conventions to select rules, such as selecting the rule from each rule group that applies to the longest suffix. In the first phase, this convention is used with the following rule group: Many of the later rules use a concept of the measure of a word, which loosely checks the number of syllables to see whether a word is long enough that it is reasonable to regard the matching portion of a rule as a suffix rather than as part of the stem of a word. For example, the rule: ( )    EMENT     replacement replac cement c http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/  Figure 2.8: A comparison of three stemming algorithms on a sample text. Other stemmers exist, including the older, one-pass Lovins stemmer (Lovins, 1968), and newer entrants like the Paice/Husk stemmer (Paice, 1990); see: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/stemmers/ http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/ 2.8 Rather than using a stemmer, you can use a lemmatizer , a tool from Natural Language Processing which does full morphological analysis to accurately identify the lemma for each word. Doing full morphological analysis produces at most very modest benefits for retrieval. It is hard to say more, because either form of normalization tends not to improve English information retrieval performance in aggregate - at least not by very much. While it helps a lot for some queries, it equally hurts performance a lot for others. Stemming increases recall while harming precision. As an example of what can go wrong, note that the Porter stemmer stems all of the following words: operate operating operates operation operative operatives operational operate operational and research operating and system operative and dentistry operate system The situation is different for languages with much more morphology (such as Spanish, German, and Finnish). Results in the European CLEF evaluations have repeatedly shown quite large gains from the use of stemmers (and compound splitting for languages like German); see the references in Section 2.5 . Exercises. Are the following statements true or false? In a Boolean retrieval system, stemming never lowers precision. In a Boolean retrieval system, stemming never lowers recall. Stemming increases the size of the vocabulary. Stemming should be invoked at indexing time but not while processing a query. Suggest what normalized form should be used for these words (including the word itself as a possibility): 'Cos Shi'ite cont'd Hawai'i O'Rourke The following pairs of words are stemmed to the same form by the Porter stemmer.

Does it have a deleterious effect on retrieval? Why or why not?
iir_2_3	Faster postings list intersection via skip pointers In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss extensions to postings list data structures and ways to increase the efficiency of using postings lists. Recall the basic postings list intersection operation from Section 1.3 (page ): we walk through the two postings lists simultaneously, in time linear in the total number of postings entries. If the list lengths are and , the intersection takes operations. Can we do better than this? That is, empirically, can we usually process postings list intersection in sublinear time? We can, if the index isn't changing too fast. One way to do this is to use a skip list by augmenting postings lists with skip pointers (at indexing time), as shown in Figure 2.9 . Skip pointers are effectively shortcuts that allow us to avoid processing parts of the postings list that will not figure in the search results. The two questions are then where to place skip pointers and how to do efficient merging using skip pointers.  Postings lists with skip pointers.The postings intersection can use a skip pointer when the end point is still less than the item on the other list.  Figure 2.10: Postings lists intersection with skip pointers. Consider first efficient merging, with Figure 2.9 as an example. Suppose we've stepped through the lists in the figure until we have matched on each list and moved it to the results list. We advance both pointers, giving us on the upper list and on the lower list. The smallest item is then the element on the top list. Rather than simply advancing the upper pointer, we first check the skip list pointer and note that 28 is also less than 41. Hence we can follow the skip list pointer, and then we advance the upper pointer to . We thus avoid stepping to and on the upper list. A number of variant versions of postings list intersection with skip pointers is possible depending on when exactly you check the skip pointer. One version is shown in Figure 2.10 . Skip pointers will only be available for the original postings lists. For an intermediate result in a complex query, the call will always return false. Finally, note that the presence of skip pointers only helps for AND queries, not for OR queries. Where do we place skips? There is a tradeoff. More skips means shorter skip spans, and that we are more likely to skip. But it also means lots of comparisons to skip pointers, and lots of space storing skip pointers. Fewer skips means few pointer comparisons, but then long skip spans which means that there will be fewer opportunities to skip. A simple heuristic for placing skips, which has been found to work well in practice, is that for a postings list of length , use evenly-spaced skip pointers. This heuristic can be improved upon; it ignores any details of the distribution of query terms. Building effective skip pointers is easy if an index is relatively static; it is harder if a postings list keeps changing because of updates. A malicious deletion strategy can render skip lists ineffective. Choosing the optimal encoding for an inverted index is an ever-changing game for the system builder, because it is strongly dependent on underlying computer technologies and their relative speeds and sizes. Traditionally, CPUs were slow, and so highly compressed techniques were not optimal. Now CPUs are fast and disk is slow, so reducing disk postings list size dominates. However, if you're running a search engine with everything in memory then the equation changes again. We discuss the impact of hardware parameters on index construction time in Section 4.1 (page ) and the impact of index size on system speed in Chapter 5 . Exercises. Why are skip pointers not useful for queries of the form OR ? We have a two-word query. For one term the postings list consists of the following 16 entries: [4,6,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,32,47,81,120,122,157,180] and for the other it is the one entry postings list: [47]. Work out how many comparisons would be done to intersect the two postings lists with the following two strategies. Briefly justify your answers: Using standard postings lists Using postings lists stored with skip pointers, with a skip length of , as suggested in Section 2.3 . Consider a postings intersection between this postings list, with skip pointers: xunit=0.6cm,arcangle=30 and the following intermediate result postings list (which hence has no skip pointers): 3    5    89    95    97    99    100    101 Trace through the postings intersection algorithm in Figure 2.10 (page ). How often is a skip pointer followed (i.e., is advanced to )? How many postings comparisons will be made by this algorithm while intersecting the two lists? How many postings comparisons would be made if the postings lists are intersected without the use of skip pointers?
iir_2_4	Positional postings and phrase queries Many complex or technical concepts and many organization and product names are multiword compounds or phrases. We would like to be able to pose a query such as Stanford University by treating it as a phrase so that a sentence in a document like The inventor Stanford Ovshinsky never went to university. is not a match. Most recent search engines support a double quotes syntax (``stanford university'') for phrase queries , which has proven to be very easily understood and successfully used by users. As many as 10% of web queries are phrase queries, and many more are implicit phrase queries (such as person names), entered without use of double quotes. To be able to support such queries, it is no longer sufficient for postings lists to be simply lists of documents that contain individual terms. In this section we consider two approaches to supporting phrase queries and their combination. A search engine should not only support phrase queries, but implement them efficiently. A related but distinct concept is term proximity weighting, where a document is preferred to the extent that the query terms appear close to each other in the text. This technique is covered in Section 7.2.2 (page ) in the context of ranked retrieval.   Subsections Biword indexes Positional indexes Positional index size. Combination schemes
iir_2_4_1	Biword indexes One approach to handling phrases is to consider every pair of consecutive terms in a document as a phrase. For example, the text Friends, Romans, Countrymen would generate the biwords : friends romans romans countrymen ``stanford university'' AND ``university palo'' AND ``palo alto'' Among possible queries, nouns and noun phrases have a special status in describing the concepts people are interested in searching for. But related nouns can often be divided from each other by various function words, in phrases such as the abolition of slavery or renegotiation of the constitution. These needs can be incorporated into the biword indexing model in the following way. First, we tokenize the text and perform part-of-speech-tagging.We can then group terms into nouns, including proper nouns, (N) and function words, including articles and prepositions, (X), among other classes. Now deem any string of terms of the form NX*N to be an extended biword. Each such extended biword is made a term in the vocabulary. For example: renegotiation of the constitution N X X N This algorithm does not always work in an intuitively optimal manner when parsing longer queries into Boolean queries. Using the above algorithm, the query cost overruns on a power plant ``cost overruns'' AND ``overruns power'' AND ``power plant'' The concept of a biword index can be extended to longer sequences of words, and if the index includes variable length word sequences, it is generally referred to as a phrase index . Indeed, searches for a single term are not naturally handled in a biword index (you would need to scan the dictionary for all biwords containing the term), and so we also need to have an index of single-word terms. While there is always a chance of false positive matches, the chance of a false positive match on indexed phrases of length 3 or more becomes very small indeed. But on the other hand, storing longer phrases has the potential to greatly expand the vocabulary size. Maintaining exhaustive phrase indexes for phrases of length greater than two is a daunting prospect, and even use of an exhaustive biword dictionary greatly expands the size of the vocabulary. However, towards the end of this section we discuss the utility of the strategy of using a partial phrase index in a compound indexing scheme.
iir_2_4_2	Positional indexes For the reasons given, a biword index is not the standard solution. Rather, a positional index is most commonly employed. Here, for each term in the vocabulary, we store postings of the form docID: position1, position2, ..., as shown in Figure 2.11 , where each position is a token index in the document. Each posting will also usually record the term frequency, for reasons discussed in Chapter 6 .   To process a phrase query, you still need to access the inverted index entries for each distinct term. As before, you would start with the least frequent term and then work to further restrict the list of possible candidates. In the merge operation, the same general technique is used as before, but rather than simply checking that both terms are in a document, you also need to check that their positions of appearance in the document are compatible with the phrase query being evaluated. This requires working out offsets between the words. Worked example. Satisfying phrase queries.phrasequery Suppose the postings lists for to and be are as in Figure 2.11 , and the query is ``to be or not to be''. The postings lists to access are: to, be, or, not. We will examine intersecting the postings lists for to and be. We first look for documents that contain both terms. Then, we look for places in the lists where there is an occurrence of be with a token index one higher than a position of to, and then we look for another occurrence of each word with token index 4 higher than the first occurrence. In the above lists, the pattern of occurrences that is a possible match is: to: ...; 4: ...,429,433 ; ... be: ...; 4: ...,430,434 ; ... End worked example.   The same general method is applied for within word proximity searches, of the sort we saw in westlaw: employment /3 place   2.12  2.4.3   Subsections Positional index size.
iir_2_4_3	Combination schemes The strategies of biword indexes and positional indexes can be fruitfully combined. If users commonly query on particular phrases, such as Michael Jackson, it is quite inefficient to keep merging positional postings lists. A combination strategy uses a phrase index, or just a biword index , for certain queries and uses a positional index for other phrase queries. Good queries to include in the phrase index are ones known to be common based on recent querying behavior. But this is not the only criterion: the most expensive phrase queries to evaluate are ones where the individual words are common but the desired phrase is comparatively rare. Adding Britney Spears as a phrase index entry may only give a speedup factor to that query of about 3, since most documents that mention either word are valid results, whereas adding The Who as a phrase index entry may speed up that query by a factor of 1000. Hence, having the latter is more desirable, even if it is a relatively less common query. Williams et al. (2004) evaluate an even more sophisticated scheme which employs indexes of both these sorts and additionally a partial next word index as a halfway house between the first two strategies. For each term, a next word index records terms that follow it in a document. They conclude that such a strategy allows a typical mixture of web phrase queries to be completed in one quarter of the time taken by use of a positional index alone, while taking up 26% more space than use of a positional index alone. Exercises. Assume a biword index. Give an example of a document which will be returned for a query of New York University but is actually a false positive which should not be returned. Shown below is a portion of a positional index in the format: term: doc1: position1, position2, ...; doc2: position1, position2, ...; etc. angels: 2: 36,174,252,651 ; 4: 12,22,102,432 ; 7: 17 ; fools: 2: 1,17,74,222 ; 4: 8,78,108,458 ; 7: 3,13,23,193 ; fear: 2: 87,704,722,901 ; 4: 13,43,113,433 ; 7: 18,328,528 ; in: 2: 3,37,76,444,851 ; 4: 10,20,110,470,500 ; 7: 5,15,25,195 ; rush: 2: 2,66,194,321,702 ; 4: 9,69,149,429,569 ; 7: 4,14,404 ; to: 2: 47,86,234,999 ; 4: 14,24,774,944 ; 7: 199,319,599,709 ; tread: 2: 57,94,333 ; 4: 15,35,155 ; 7: 20,320 ; where: 2: 67,124,393,1001 ; 4: 11,41,101,421,431 ; 7: 16,36,736 ; Which document(s) if any match each of the following queries, where each expression within quotes is a phrase query? ``fools rush in'' ``fools rush in'' AND ``angels fear to tread'' Consider the following fragment of a positional index with the format: word: document: position, position, ; document: position, ... Gates: 1: 3 ; 2: 6 ; 3: 2,17 ; 4: 1 ; IBM: 4: 3 ; 7: 14 ; Microsoft: 1: 1 ; 2: 1,21 ; 3: 3 ; 5: 16,22,51 ; The / operator, word1 / word2 finds occurrences of word1 within words of word2 (on either side), where is a positive integer argument. Thus demands that word1 be adjacent to word2. Describe the set of documents that satisfy the query Gates /2 Microsoft. Describe each set of values for for which the query Gates / Microsoft returns a different set of documents as the answer. Consider the general procedure for merging two positional postings lists for a given document, to determine the document positions where a document satisfies a / clause (in general there can be multiple positions at which each term occurs in a single document). We begin with a pointer to the position of occurrence of each term and move each pointer along the list of occurrences in the document, checking as we do so whether we have a hit for /. Each move of either pointer counts as a step. Let denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document. What is the big-O complexity of the merge procedure, if we wish to have postings including positions in the result? Consider the adaptation of the basic algorithm for intersection of two postings lists postings-merge-algorithm to the one in Figure 2.12 (page ), which handles proximity queries. A naive algorithm for this operation could be , where is the sum of the lengths of the postings lists (i.e., the sum of document frequencies) and is the maximum length of a document (in tokens). Go through this algorithm carefully and explain how it works. What is the complexity of this algorithm? Justify your answer carefully. For certain queries and data distributions, would another algorithm be more efficient? What complexity does it have? Suppose we wish to use a postings intersection procedure to determine simply the list of documents that satisfy a / clause, rather than returning the list of positions, as in Figure 2.12 (page ). For simplicity, assume . Let denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document collection (i.e., the sum of their collection frequencies). Which of the following is true? Justify your answer. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in and independent of , and we can ensure that each pointer moves only to the right. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in and independent of , but a pointer may be forced to move non-monotonically (i.e., to sometimes back up) The merge can require steps in some cases. How could an IR system combine use of a positional index and use of stop words? What is the potential problem, and how could it be handled?
iir_2_5	References and further reading Exhaustive discussion of the character-level processing of can be found in Lunde (1998). Character bigram indexes are perhaps the most standard approach to indexing Chinese, although some systems use word segmentation. Due to differences in the language and writing system, word segmentation is most usual for Japanese (Luk and Kwok, 2002, Kishida et al., 2005). The structure of a character -gram index over unsegmented text differs from that in Section 3.2.2 (page ): there the -gram dictionary points to postings lists of entries in the regular dictionary, whereas here it points directly to document postings lists. For further discussion of Chinese word segmentation, see Tseng et al. (2005), Sproat and Emerson (2003), Sproat et al. (1996), and Gao et al. (2005). Lita et al. (2003) present a method for truecasing . Natural language processing work on computational morphology is presented in (Sproat, 1992, Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). Language identification was perhaps first explored in cryptography; for example, Konheim (1981) presents a character-level -gram language identification algorithm. While other methods such as looking for particular distinctive function words and letter combinations have been used, with the advent of widespread digital text, many people have explored the character -gram technique, and found it to be highly successful (Beesley, 1998, Dunning, 1994, Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994). Written language identification is regarded as a fairly easy problem, while spoken language identification remains more difficult; see Hughes et al. (2006) for a recent survey. Experiments on and discussion of the positive and negative impact of stemming in English can be found in the following works: Salton (1989), Krovetz (1995), Hull (1996), Harman (1991). Hollink et al. (2004) provide detailed results for the effectiveness of language-specific methods on 8 European languages. In terms of percent change in mean average precision (see page 8.4 ) over a baseline system, diacritic removal gains up to 23% (being especially helpful for Finnish, French, and Swedish). Stemming helped markedly for Finnish (30% improvement) and Spanish (10% improvement), but for most languages, including English, the gain from stemming was in the range 0-5%, and results from a lemmatizer were poorer still. Compound splitting gained 25% for Swedish and 15% for German, but only 4% for Dutch. Rather than language-particular methods, indexing character -grams (as we suggested for Chinese) could often give as good or better results: using within-word character 4-grams rather than words gave gains of 37% in Finnish, 27% in Swedish, and 20% in German, while even being slightly positive for other languages, such as Dutch, Spanish, and English. Tomlinson (2003) presents broadly similar results. Bar-Ilan and Gutman (2005) suggest that, at the time of their study (2003), the major commercial web search engines suffered from lacking decent language-particular processing; for example, a query on www.google.fr for l'électricité did not separate off the article l' but only matched pages with precisely this string of article+noun. The classic presentation of for IR can be found in Moffat and Zobel (1996). Extended techniques are discussed in Boldi and Vigna (2005). The main paper in the algorithms literature is Pugh (1990), which uses multilevel skip pointers to give expected list access (the same expected efficiency as using a tree data structure) with less implementational complexity. In practice, the effectiveness of using skip pointers depends on various system parameters. Moffat and Zobel (1996) report conjunctive queries running about five times faster with the use of skip pointers, but Bahle et al. (2002, p. 217) report that, with modern CPUs, using skip lists instead slows down search because it expands the size of the postings list (i.e., disk I/O dominates performance). In contrast, Strohman and Croft (2007) again show good performance gains from skipping, in a system architecture designed to optimize for the large memory spaces and multiple cores of recent CPUs. Johnson et al. (2006) report that 11.7% of all queries in two 2002 web query logs contained phrase queries , though Kammenhuber et al. (2006) report only 3% phrase queries for a different data set. Silverstein et al. (1999) note that many queries without explicit phrase operators are actually implicit phrase searches.
iir_3	Dictionaries and tolerant retrieval In Chapters 1 2 we developed the ideas underlying inverted indexes for handling Boolean and proximity queries. Here, we develop techniques that are robust to typographical errors in the query, as well as alternative spellings. In Section 3.1 we develop data structures that help the search for terms in the vocabulary in an inverted index. In Section 3.2 we study the idea of a wildcard query : a query such as *a*e*i*o*u*, which seeks documents containing any term that includes all the five vowels in sequence. The * symbol indicates any (possibly empty) string of characters. Users pose such queries to a search engine when they are uncertain about how to spell a query term, or seek documents containing variants of a query term; for instance, the query automat* would seek documents containing any of the terms automatic, automation and automated. We then turn to other forms of imprecisely posed queries, focusing on spelling errors in Section 3.3 . Users make spelling errors either by accident, or because the term they are searching for (e.g., Herman) has no unambiguous spelling in the collection. We detail a number of techniques for correcting spelling errors in queries, one term at a time as well as for an entire string of query terms. Finally, in Section 3.4 we study a method for seeking vocabulary terms that are phonetically close to the query term(s). This can be especially useful in cases like the Herman example, where the user may not know how a proper name is spelled in documents in the collection. Because we will develop many variants of inverted indexes in this chapter, we will use sometimes the phrase standard inverted index to mean the inverted index developed in Chapters 1 2 , in which each vocabulary term has a postings list with the documents in the collection.

iir_3_1	Search structures for dictionaries Given an inverted index and a query, our first task is to determine whether each query term exists in the vocabulary and if so, identify the pointer to the corresponding postings. This vocabulary lookup operation uses a classical data structure called the dictionary and has two broad classes of solutions: hashing, and search trees. In the literature of data structures, the entries in the vocabulary (in our case, terms) are often referred to as keys. The choice of solution (hashing, or search trees) is governed by a number of questions: (1) How many keys are we likely to have? (2) Is the number likely to remain static, or change a lot - and in the case of changes, are we likely to only have new keys inserted, or to also have some keys in the dictionary be deleted? (3) What are the relative frequencies with which various keys will be accessed? Hashing has been used for dictionary lookup in some search engines. Each vocabulary term (key) is hashed into an integer over a large enough space that hash collisions are unlikely; collisions if any are resolved by auxiliary structures that can demand care to maintain. At query time, we hash each query term separately and following a pointer to the corresponding postings, taking into account any logic for resolving hash collisions. There is no easy way to find minor variants of a query term (such as the accented and non-accented versions of a word like resume), since these could be hashed to very different integers. In particular, we cannot seek (for instance) all terms beginning with the prefix automat, an operation that we will require below in Section 3.2 . Finally, in a setting (such as the Web) where the size of the vocabulary keeps growing, a hash function designed for current needs may not suffice in a few years' time.  A binary search tree.In this example the branch at the root partitions vocabulary terms into two subtrees, those whose first letter is between a and m, and the rest. Search trees overcome many of these issues - for instance, they permit us to enumerate all vocabulary terms beginning with automat. The best-known search tree is the binary tree , in which each internal node has two children. The search for a term begins at the root of the tree. Each internal node (including the root) represents a binary test, based on whose outcome the search proceeds to one of the two sub-trees below that node. Figure 3.1 gives an example of a binary search tree used for a dictionary. Efficient search (with a number of comparisons that is ) hinges on the tree being balanced: the numbers of terms under the two sub-trees of any node are either equal or differ by one. The principal issue here is that of rebalancing: as terms are inserted into or deleted from the binary search tree, it needs to be rebalanced so that the balance property is maintained. To mitigate rebalancing, one approach is to allow the number of sub-trees under an internal node to vary in a fixed interval. A search tree commonly used for a dictionary is the B-tree - a search tree in which every internal node has a number of children in the interval , where and are appropriate positive integers; Figure 3.2 shows an example with and . Each branch under an internal node again represents a test for a range of character sequences, as in the binary tree example of Figure 3.1 . A B-tree may be viewed as ``collapsing'' multiple levels of the binary tree into one; this is especially advantageous when some of the dictionary is disk-resident, in which case this collapsing serves the function of pre-fetching imminent binary tests. In such cases, the integers and are determined by the sizes of disk blocks. Section 3.5 contains pointers to further background on search trees and B-trees.  A B-tree.In this example every internal node has between 2 and 4 children. It should be noted that unlike hashing, search trees demand that the characters used in the document collection have a prescribed ordering; for instance, the 26 letters of the English alphabet are always listed in the specific order A through Z. Some Asian languages such as Chinese do not always have a unique ordering, although by now all languages (including Chinese and Japanese) have adopted a standard ordering system for their character sets.
iir_3_2	Wildcard queries Wildcard queries are used in any of the following situations: (1) the user is uncertain of the spelling of a query term (e.g., Sydney vs. Sidney, which leads to the wildcard query S*dney); (2) the user is aware of multiple variants of spelling a term and (consciously) seeks documents containing any of the variants (e.g., color vs. colour); (3) the user seeks documents containing variants of a term that would be caught by stemming, but is unsure whether the search engine performs stemming (e.g., judicial vs. judiciary, leading to the wildcard query judicia*); (4) the user is uncertain of the correct rendition of a foreign word or phrase (e.g., the query Universit* Stuttgart). A query such as mon* is known as a trailing wildcard query , because the * symbol occurs only once, at the end of the search string. A search tree on the dictionary is a convenient way of handling trailing wildcard queries: we walk down the tree following the symbols m, o and n in turn, at which point we can enumerate the set of terms in the dictionary with the prefix mon. Finally, we use lookups on the standard inverted index to retrieve all documents containing any term in . But what about wildcard queries in which the * symbol is not constrained to be at the end of the search string? Before handling this general case, we mention a slight generalization of trailing wildcard queries. First, consider leading wildcard queries, or queries of the form *mon. Consider a reverse B-tree on the dictionary - one in which each root-to-leaf path of the B-tree corresponds to a term in the dictionary written backwards: thus, the term lemon would, in the B-tree, be represented by the path root-n-o-m-e-l. A walk down the reverse B-tree then enumerates all terms in the vocabulary with a given prefix. In fact, using a regular B-tree together with a reverse B-tree, we can handle an even more general case: wildcard queries in which there is a single * symbol, such as se*mon. To do this, we use the regular B-tree to enumerate the set of dictionary terms beginning with the prefix se, then the reverse B-tree to enumerate the set of terms ending with the suffix mon. Next, we take the intersection of these two sets, to arrive at the set of terms that begin with the prefix se and end with the suffix mon. Finally, we use the standard inverted index to retrieve all documents containing any terms in this intersection. We can thus handle wildcard queries that contain a single * symbol using two B-trees, the normal B-tree and a reverse B-tree.   Subsections General wildcard queries Permuterm indexes k-gram indexes for wildcard queries
iir_3_2_2	k-gram indexes for wildcard queries Whereas the permuterm index is simple, it can lead to a considerable blowup from the number of rotations per term; for a dictionary of English terms, this can represent an almost ten-fold space increase. We now present a second technique, known as the -gram index, for processing wildcard queries. We will also use -gram indexes in Section 3.3.4 . A -gram is a sequence of characters. Thus cas, ast and stl are all 3-grams occurring in the term castle. We use a special character $ to denote the beginning or end of a term, so the full set of 3-grams generated for castle is: $ca, cas, ast, stl, tle, le$. In a -gram index , the dictionary contains all -grams that occur in any term in the vocabulary. Each postings list points from a -gram to all vocabulary terms containing that -gram. For instance, the 3-gram etr would point to vocabulary terms such as metric and retrieval. An example is given in Figure 3.4 .   How does such an index help us with wildcard queries? Consider the wildcard query re*ve. We are seeking documents containing any term that begins with re and ends with ve. Accordingly, we run the Boolean query $re AND ve$. This is looked up in the 3-gram index and yields a list of matching terms such as relive, remove and retrieve. Each of these matching terms is then looked up in the standard inverted index to yield documents matching the query. There is however a difficulty with the use of -gram indexes, that demands one further step of processing. Consider using the 3-gram index described above for the query red*. Following the process described above, we first issue the Boolean query $re AND red to the 3-gram index. This leads to a match on terms such as retired, which contain the conjunction of the two 3-grams $re and red, yet do not match the original wildcard query red*. To cope with this, we introduce a post-filtering step, in which the terms enumerated by the Boolean query on the 3-gram index are checked individually against the original query red*. This is a simple string-matching operation and weeds out terms such as retired that do not match the original query. Terms that survive are then searched in the standard inverted index as usual. We have seen that a wildcard query can result in multiple terms being enumerated, each of which becomes a single-term query on the standard inverted index. Search engines do allow the combination of wildcard queries using Boolean operators, for example, re*d AND fe*ri. What is the appropriate semantics for such a query? Since each wildcard query turns into a disjunction of single-term queries, the appropriate interpretation of this example is that we have a conjunction of disjunctions: we seek all documents that contain any term matching re*d and any term matching fe*ri. Even without Boolean combinations of wildcard queries, the processing of a wildcard query can be quite expensive, because of the added lookup in the special index, filtering and finally the standard inverted index. A search engine may support such rich functionality, but most commonly, the capability is hidden behind an interface (say an ``Advanced Query'' interface) that most users never use. Exposing such functionality in the search interface often encourages users to invoke it even when they do not require it (say, by typing a prefix of their query followed by a *), increasing the processing load on the search engine. Exercises. In the permuterm index, each permuterm vocabulary term points to the original vocabulary term(s) from which it was derived. How many original vocabulary terms can there be in the postings list of a permuterm vocabulary term? Write down the entries in the permuterm index dictionary that are generated by the term mama. If you wanted to search for s*ng in a permuterm wildcard index, what key(s) would one do the lookup on? Refer to Figure 3.4 ; it is pointed out in the caption that the vocabulary terms in the postings are lexicographically ordered. Why is this ordering useful? Consider again the query fi*mo*er from Section 3.2.1 . What Boolean query on a bigram index would be generated for this query? Can you think of a term that matches the permuterm query in Section 3.2.1 , but does not satisfy this Boolean query? Give an example of a sentence that falsely matches the wildcard query mon*h if the search were to simply use a conjunction of bigrams.
iir_3_3	Spelling correction We next look at the problem of correcting spelling errors in queries. For instance, we may wish to retrieve documents containing the term carrot when the user types the query carot. Google reports (http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html) that the following are all treated as misspellings of the query britney spears: britian spears, britney's spears, brandy spears and prittany spears. We look at two steps to solving this problem: the first based on edit distance and the second based on -gram overlap. Before getting into the algorithmic details of these methods, we first review how search engines provide spell-correction as part of a user experience.   Subsections Implementing spelling correction Forms of spelling correction Edit distance k-gram indexes for spelling correction Context sensitive spelling correction
iir_3_3_1	Implementing spelling correction Of various alternative correct spellings for a mis-spelled query, choose the ``nearest'' one. This demands that we have a notion of nearness or proximity between a pair of queries. We will develop these proximity measures in Section 3.3.3 . When two correctly spelled queries are tied (or nearly tied), select the one that is more common. For instance, grunt and grant both seem equally plausible as corrections for grnt. Then, the algorithm should choose the more common of grunt and grant as the correction. The simplest notion of more common is to consider the number of occurrences of the term in the collection; thus if grunt occurs more often than grant, it would be the chosen correction. A different notion of more common is employed in many search engines, especially on the web. The idea is to use the correction that is most common among queries typed in by other users. The idea here is that if grunt is typed as a query more often than grant, then it is more likely that the user who typed grnt intended to type the query grunt. Beginning in Section 3.3.3 we describe notions of proximity between queries, as well as their efficient computation. Spelling correction algorithms build on these computations of proximity; their functionality is then exposed to users in one of several ways: On the query carot always retrieve documents containing carot as well as any ``spell-corrected'' version of carot, including carrot and tarot. As in (1) above, but only when the query term carot is not in the dictionary. As in (1) above, but only when the original query returned fewer than a preset number of documents (say fewer than five documents). When the original query returns fewer than a preset number of documents, the search interface presents a spelling suggestion to the end user: this suggestion consists of the spell-corrected query term(s). Thus, the search engine might respond to the user: ``Did you mean carrot?''
iir_3_3_2	Forms of spelling correction isolated-term context-sensitive We begin by examining two techniques for addressing isolated-term correction: edit distance, and -gram overlap. We then proceed to context-sensitive correction.
iir_3_3_3	Edit distance    edit distance edit operations    Levenshtein distance 3.4 It is well-known how to compute the (weighted) edit distance between two strings in time , where denotes the length of a string . The idea is to use the dynamic programming algorithm in Figure 3.5 , where the characters in and are given in array form. The algorithm fills the (integer) entries in a matrix whose two dimensions equal the lengths of the two strings whose edit distances is being computed; the entry of the matrix will hold (after the algorithm is executed) the edit distance between the strings consisting of the first characters of and the first characters of . The central dynamic programming step is depicted in Lines 8-10 of Figure 3.5 , where the three quantities whose minimum is taken correspond to substituting a character in , inserting a character in and inserting a character in .  Figure 3.5: Dynamic programming algorithm for computing the edit distance between strings and . Figure 3.6 shows an example Levenshtein distance computation of Figure 3.5 . The typical cell has four entries formatted as a cell. The lower right entry in each cell is the of the other three, corresponding to the main dynamic programming step in Figure 3.5 . The other three entries are the three entries or 1 depending on whether and . The cells with numbers in italics depict the path by which we determine the Levenshtein distance.   The spelling correction problem however demands more than computing edit distance: given a set of strings (corresponding to terms in the vocabulary) and a query string , we seek the string(s) in of least edit distance from . We may view this as a decoding problem, in which the codewords (the strings in ) are prescribed in advance. The obvious way of doing this is to compute the edit distance from to each string in , before selecting the string(s) of minimum edit distance. This exhaustive search is inordinately expensive. Accordingly, a number of heuristics are used in practice to efficiently retrieve vocabulary terms likely to have low edit distance to the query term(s). The simplest such heuristic is to restrict the search to dictionary terms beginning with the same letter as the query string; the hope would be that spelling errors do not occur in the first character of the query. A more sophisticated variant of this heuristic is to use a version of the permuterm index, in which we omit the end-of-word symbol $. Consider the set of all rotations of the query string . For each rotation from this set, we traverse the B-tree into the permuterm index, thereby retrieving all dictionary terms that have a rotation beginning with . For instance, if is mase and we consider the rotation , we would retrieve dictionary terms such as semantic and semaphore that do not have a small edit distance to . Unfortunately, we would miss more pertinent dictionary terms such as mare and mane. To address this, we refine this rotation scheme: for each rotation, we omit a suffix of characters before performing the B-tree traversal. This ensures that each term in the set of terms retrieved from the dictionary includes a ``long'' substring in common with . The value of could depend on the length of . Alternatively, we may set it to a fixed constant such as .
iir_3_3_4	k-gram indexes for spelling correction To further limit the set of vocabulary terms for which we compute edit distances to the query term, we now show how to invoke the -gram index of Section 3.2.2 (page ) to assist with retrieving vocabulary terms with low edit distance to the query . Once we retrieve such terms, we can then find the ones of least edit distance from . In fact, we will use the -gram index to retrieve vocabulary terms that have many -grams in common with the query. We will argue that for reasonable definitions of ``many -grams in common,'' the retrieval process is essentially that of a single scan through the postings for the -grams in the query string .  Figure: Matching at least two of the three 2-grams in the query bord. The 2-gram (or bigram) index in Figure 3.7 shows (a portion of) the postings for the three bigrams in the query bord. Suppose we wanted to retrieve vocabulary terms that contained at least two of these three bigrams. A single scan of the postings (much as in Chapter 1 ) would let us enumerate all such terms; in the example of Figure 3.7 we would enumerate aboard, boardroom and border. This straightforward application of the linear scan intersection of postings immediately reveals the shortcoming of simply requiring matched vocabulary terms to contain a fixed number of -grams from the query : terms like boardroom, an implausible ``correction'' of bord, get enumerated. Consequently, we require more nuanced measures of the overlap in -grams between a vocabulary term and . The linear scan intersection can be adapted when the measure of overlap is the Jaccard coefficient for measuring the overlap between two sets and , defined to be . The two sets we consider are the set of -grams in the query , and the set of -grams in a vocabulary term. As the scan proceeds, we proceed from one vocabulary term to the next, computing on the fly the Jaccard coefficient between and . If the coefficient exceeds a preset threshold, we add to the output; if not, we move on to the next term in the postings. To compute the Jaccard coefficient, we need the set of -grams in and . Since we are scanning the postings for all -grams in , we immediately have these -grams on hand. What about the -grams of ? In principle, we could enumerate these on the fly from ; in practice this is not only slow but potentially infeasible since, in all likelihood, the postings entries themselves do not contain the complete string but rather some encoding of . The crucial observation is that to compute the Jaccard coefficient, we only need the length of the string . To see this, recall the example of Figure 3.7 and consider the point when the postings scan for query bord reaches term boardroom. We know that two bigrams match. If the postings stored the (pre-computed) number of bigrams in boardroom (namely, 8), we have all the information we require to compute the Jaccard coefficient to be ; the numerator is obtained from the number of postings hits (2, from bo and rd) while the denominator is the sum of the number of bigrams in bord and boardroom, less the number of postings hits. We could replace the Jaccard coefficient by other measures that allow efficient on the fly computation during postings scans. How do we use these for spelling correction? One method that has some empirical support is to first use the -gram index to enumerate a set of candidate vocabulary terms that are potential corrections of . We then compute the edit distance from to each term in this set, selecting terms from the set with small edit distance to .
iir_3_3_5	Context sensitive spelling correction 3.3.4 This enumeration can be expensive if we find many corrections of the individual terms, since we could encounter a large number of combinations of alternatives. Several heuristics are used to trim this space. In the example above, as we expand the alternatives for flew and form, we retain only the most frequent combinations in the collection or in the query logs, which contain previous queries by users. For instance, we would retain flew from as an alternative to try and extend to a three-term corrected query, but perhaps not fled fore or flea form. In this example, the biword fled fore is likely to be rare compared to the biword flew from. Then, we only attempt to extend the list of top biwords (such as flew from), to corrections of Heathrow. As an alternative to using the biword statistics in the collection, we may use the logs of queries issued by users; these could of course include queries with spelling errors. Exercises. If denotes the length of string , show that the edit distance between and is never more than Compute the edit distance between paris and alice. Write down the array of distances between all prefixes as computed by the algorithm in Figure 3.5 . Write pseudocode showing the details of computing on the fly the Jaccard coefficient while scanning the postings of the -gram index, as mentioned on page 3.3.4 . Compute the Jaccard coefficients between the query bord and each of the terms in Figure 3.7 that contain the bigram or. Consider the four-term query catched in the rye and suppose that each of the query terms has five alternative terms suggested by isolated-term correction. How many possible corrected phrases must we consider if we do not trim the space of corrected phrases, but instead try all six variants for each of the terms? For each of the prefixes of the query -- catched, catched in and catched in the -- we have a number of substitute prefixes arising from each term and its alternatives. Suppose that we were to retain only the top 10 of these substitute prefixes, as measured by its number of occurrences in the collection. We eliminate the rest from consideration for extension to longer prefixes: thus, if batched in is not one of the 10 most common 2-term queries in the collection, we do not consider any extension of batched in as possibly leading to a correction of catched in the rye. How many of the possible substitute prefixes are we eliminating at each phase? Are we guaranteed that retaining and extending only the 10 commonest substitute prefixes of catched in will lead to one of the 10 commonest substitute prefixes of catched in the?
iir_3_4	Phonetic correction phonetic Algorithms for such phonetic hashing are commonly collectively known as soundex algorithms. However, there is an original soundex algorithm, with various variants, built on the following scheme: Turn every term to be indexed into a 4-character reduced form. Build an inverted index from these reduced forms to the original terms; call this the soundex index. Do the same with query terms. When the query calls for a soundex match, search this soundex index. Retain the first letter of the term. Change all occurrences of the following letters to '0' (zero): 'A', E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'H', 'W', 'Y'. Change letters to digits as follows: B, F, P, V to 1. C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z to 2. D,T to 3. L to 4. M, N to 5. R to 6. Repeatedly remove one out of each pair of consecutive identical digits. Remove all zeros from the resulting string. Pad the resulting string with trailing zeros and return the first four positions, which will consist of a letter followed by three digits. For an example of a soundex map, Hermann maps to H655. Given a query (say herman), we compute its soundex code and then retrieve all vocabulary terms matching this soundex code from the soundex index, before running the resulting query on the standard inverted index. This algorithm rests on a few observations: (1) vowels are viewed as interchangeable, in transcribing names; (2) consonants with similar sounds (e.g., D and T) are put in equivalence classes. This leads to related names often having the same soundex codes. While these rules work for many cases, especially European languages, such rules tend to be writing system dependent. For example, Chinese names can be written in Wade-Giles or Pinyin transcription. While soundex works for some of the differences in the two transcriptions, for instance mapping both Wade-Giles hs and Pinyin x to 2, it fails in other cases, for example Wade-Giles j and Pinyin r are mapped differently. Exercises. Find two differently spelled proper nouns whose soundex codes are the same. Find two phonetically similar proper nouns whose soundex codes are different.
iir_3_5	References and further reading Knuth (1997) is a comprehensive source for information on search trees, including B-trees and their use in searching through dictionaries. Garfield (1976) gives one of the first complete descriptions of the permuterm index. Ferragina and Venturini (2007) give an approach to addressing the space blowup in permuterm indexes. One of the earliest formal treatments of spelling correction was due to Damerau (1964). The notion of edit distance that we have used is due to Levenshtein (1965) and the algorithm in Figure 3.5 is due to Wagner and Fischer (1974). Peterson (1980) and Kukich (1992) developed variants of methods based on edit distances, culminating in a detailed empirical study of several methods by Zobel and Dart (1995), which shows that -gram indexing is very effective for finding candidate mismatches, but should be combined with a more fine-grained technique such as edit distance to determine the most likely misspellings. Gusfield (1997) is a standard reference on string algorithms such as edit distance. Probabilistic models (``noisy channel'' models) for spelling correction were pioneered by Kernighan et al. (1990) and further developed by Brill and Moore (2000) and Toutanova and Moore (2002). In these models, the mis-spelled query is viewed as a probabilistic corruption of a correct query. They have a similar mathematical basis to the language model methods presented in Chapter 12 , and also provide ways of incorporating phonetic similarity, closeness on the keyboard, and data from the actual spelling mistakes of users. Many would regard them as the state-of-the-art approach. Cucerzan and Brill (2004) show how this work can be extended to learning spelling correction models based on query reformulations in search engine logs. The soundex algorithm is attributed to Margaret K. Odell and Robert C. Russelli (from U.S. patents granted in 1918 and 1922); the version described here draws on Bourne and Ford (1961). Zobel and Dart (1996) evaluate various phonetic matching algorithms, finding that a variant of the soundex algorithm performs poorly for general spelling correction, but that other algorithms based on the phonetic similarity of term pronunciations perform well.
iir_4	Index construction In this chapter, we look at how to construct an inverted index. We call this process index construction or indexing ; the process or machine that performs it the indexer . The design of indexing algorithms is governed by hardware constraints. We therefore begin this chapter with a review of the basics of computer hardware that are relevant for indexing. We then introduce blocked sort-based indexing (Section 4.2 ), an efficient single-machine algorithm designed for static collections that can be viewed as a more scalable version of the basic sort-based indexing algorithm we introduced in Chapter 1 . Section 4.3 describes single-pass in-memory indexing, an algorithm that has even better scaling properties because it does not hold the vocabulary in memory. For very large collections like the web, indexing has to be distributed over computer clusters with hundreds or thousands of machines. We discuss this in Section 4.4 . Collections with frequent changes require dynamic indexing introduced in Section 4.5 so that changes in the collection are immediately reflected in the index. Finally, we cover some complicating issues that can arise in indexing - such as security and indexes for ranked retrieval - in Section 4.6 . Index construction interacts with several topics covered in other chapters. The indexer needs raw text, but documents are encoded in many ways (see Chapter 2 ). Indexers compress and decompress intermediate files and the final index (see Chapter 5 ). In web search, documents are not on a local file system, but have to be spidered or crawled (see Chapter 20 ). In enterprise search , most documents are encapsulated in varied content management systems, email applications, and databases. We give some examples in Section 4.7 . Although most of these applications can be accessed via http, native Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are usually more efficient. The reader should be aware that building the subsystem that feeds raw text to the indexing process can in itself be a challenging problem.

iir_4_1	Hardware basics   Table 4.1: Typical system parameters in 2007. The seek time is the time needed to position the disk head in a new position. The transfer time per byte is the rate of transfer from disk to memory when the head is in the right position.   Symbol Statistic Value     average seek time 5 ms s     transfer time per byte 0.02 s s       processor's clock rate     lowlevel operation             (e.g., compare   swap a word) 0.01 s s       size of main memory several GB       size of disk space 1 TB or more    When building an information retrieval (IR) system, many decisions are based on the characteristics of the computer hardware on which the system runs. We therefore begin this chapter with a brief review of computer hardware. Performance characteristics typical of systems in 2007 are shown in Table 4.1 . A list of hardware basics that we need in this book to motivate IR system design follows. Access to data in memory is much faster than access to data on disk. It takes a few clock cycles (perhaps seconds) to access a byte in memory, but much longer to transfer it from disk (about seconds). Consequently, we want to keep as much data as possible in memory, especially those data that we need to access frequently. We call the technique of keeping frequently used disk data in main memory caching . When doing a disk read or write, it takes a while for the disk head to move to the part of the disk where the data are located. This time is called the seek time and it averages 5 ms for typical disks. No data are being transferred during the seek. To maximize data transfer rates, chunks of data that will be read together should therefore be stored contiguously on disk. For example, using the numbers in Table 4.1 it may take as little as 0.2 seconds to transfer 10 megabytes (MB) from disk to memory if it is stored as one chunk, but up to seconds if it is stored in 100 noncontiguous chunks because we need to move the disk head up to 100 times. Operating systems generally read and write entire blocks. Thus, reading a single byte from disk can take as much time as reading the entire block. Block sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64 kilobytes (KB) are common. We call the part of main memory where a block being read or written is stored a buffer . Data transfers from disk to memory are handled by the system bus, not by the processor. This means that the processor is available to process data during disk I/O. We can exploit this fact to speed up data transfers by storing compressed data on disk. Assuming an efficient decompression algorithm, the total time of reading and then decompressing compressed data is usually less than reading uncompressed data. Servers used in IR systems typically have several gigabytes (GB) of main memory, sometimes tens of GB. Available disk space is several orders of magnitude larger.
iir_4_2	Blocked sort-based indexing The basic steps in constructing a nonpositional index are depicted in Figure 1.4 (page ). We first make a pass through the collection assembling all term-docID pairs. We then sort the pairs with the term as the dominant key and docID as the secondary key. Finally, we organize the docIDs for each term into a postings list and compute statistics like term and document frequency. For small collections, all this can be done in memory. In this chapter, we describe methods for large collections that require the use of secondary storage. To make index construction more efficient, we represent terms as termIDs (instead of strings as we did in Figure 1.4 ), where each termID is a unique serial number. We can build the mapping from terms to termIDs on the fly while we are processing the collection; or, in a two-pass approach, we compile the vocabulary in the first pass and construct the inverted index in the second pass. The index construction algorithms described in this chapter all do a single pass through the data. Section 4.7 gives references to multipass algorithms that are preferable in certain applications, for example, when disk space is scarce. We work with the Reuters-RCV1 collection as our model collection in this chapter, a collection with roughly 1 GB of text. It consists of about 800,000 documents that were sent over the Reuters newswire during a 1-year period between August 20, 1996, and August 19, 1997. A typical document is shown in Figure 4.1 , but note that we ignore multimedia information like images in this book and are only concerned with text. Reuters-RCV1 covers a wide range of international topics, including politics, business, sports, and (as in this example) science. Some key statistics of the collection are shown in Table 4.2 . Reuters-RCV1 has 100 million tokens. Collecting all termID-docID pairs of the collection using 4 bytes each for termID and docID therefore requires 0.8 GB of storage. Typical collections today are often one or two orders of magnitude larger than Reuters-RCV1. You can easily see how such collections overwhelm even large computers if we try to sort their termID-docID pairs in memory. If the size of the intermediate files during index construction is within a small factor of available memory, then the compression techniques introduced in Chapter 5 can help; however, the postings file of many large collections cannot fit into memory even after compression.   Table: Collection statistics for Reuters-RCV1. Values are rounded for the computations in this book. The unrounded values are: 806,791 documents, 222 tokens per document, 391,523 (distinct) terms, 6.04 bytes per token with spaces and punctuation, 4.5 bytes per token without spaces and punctuation, 7.5 bytes per term, and 96,969,056 tokens. The numbers in this table correspond to the third line (``case folding'') in icompresstb5.   Symbol Statistic Value     documents 800,000     avg. # tokens per document 200     terms 400,000       avg. # bytes per token (incl. spaces/punct.) 6       avg. # bytes per token (without spaces/punct.) 4.5       avg. # bytes per term 7.5     tokens 100,000,000     Figure 4.1: Document from the Reuters newswire. With main memory insufficient, we need to use an external sorting algorithm , that is, one that uses disk. For acceptable speed, the central requirement of such an algorithm is that it minimize the number of random disk seeks during sorting - sequential disk reads are far faster than seeks as we explained in Section 4.1 . One solution is the blocked sort-based indexing algorithm or BSBI in Figure 4.2 . BSBI (i) segments the collection into parts of equal size, (ii) sorts the termID-docID pairs of each part in memory, (iii) stores intermediate sorted results on disk, and (iv) merges all intermediate results into the final index. The algorithm parses documents into termID-docID pairs and accumulates the pairs in memory until a block of a fixed size is full (PARSENEXTBLOCK in Figure 4.2 ). We choose the block size to fit comfortably into memory to permit a fast in-memory sort. The block is then inverted and written to disk. Inversion involves two steps. First, we sort the termID-docID pairs. Next, we collect all termID-docID pairs with the same termID into a postings list, where a posting is simply a docID. The result, an inverted index for the block we have just read, is then written to disk. Applying this to Reuters-RCV1 and assuming we can fit 10 million termID-docID pairs into memory, we end up with ten blocks, each an inverted index of one part of the collection.    Merging in blocked sort-based indexing.Two blocks (``postings lists to be merged'') are loaded from disk into memory, merged in memory (``merged postings lists'') and written back to disk. We show terms instead of termIDs for better readability. In the final step, the algorithm simultaneously merges the ten blocks into one large merged index. An example with two blocks is shown in Figure 4.3 , where we use to denote the document of the collection. To do the merging, we open all block files simultaneously, and maintain small read buffers for the ten blocks we are reading and a write buffer for the final merged index we are writing. In each iteration, we select the lowest termID that has not been processed yet using a priority queue or a similar data structure. All postings lists for this termID are read and merged, and the merged list is written back to disk. Each read buffer is refilled from its file when necessary. How expensive is BSBI? Its time complexity is because the step with the highest time complexity is sorting and is an upper bound for the number of items we must sort (i.e., the number of termID-docID pairs). But the actual indexing time is usually dominated by the time it takes to parse the documents (PARSENEXTBLOCK) and to do the final merge (MERGEBLOCKS). Exercise 4.6 asks you to compute the total index construction time for RCV1 that includes these steps as well as inverting the blocks and writing them to disk. Notice that Reuters-RCV1 is not particularly large in an age when one or more GB of memory are standard on personal computers. With appropriate compression (Chapter 5 ), we could have created an inverted index for RCV1 in memory on a not overly beefy server. The techniques we have described are needed, however, for collections that are several orders of magnitude larger. Exercises. If we need comparisons (where is the number of termID-docID pairs) and two disk seeks for each comparison, how much time would index construction for Reuters-RCV1 take if we used disk instead of memory for storage and an unoptimized sorting algorithm (i.e., not an external sorting algorithm)? Use the system parameters in Table 4.1 . How would you create the dictionary in blocked sort-based indexing on the fly to avoid an extra pass through the data?
iir_4_3	Single-pass in-memory indexing  single-pass in-memory indexing  SPIMI  Figure 4.4: Inversion of a block in single-pass in-memory indexing The SPIMI algorithm is shown in Figure 4.4 . The part of the algorithm that parses documents and turns them into a stream of term-docID pairs, which we call tokens here, has been omitted. SPIMI-INVERT is called repeatedly on the token stream until the entire collection has been processed. Tokens are processed one by one (line 4) during each successive call of SPIMI-INVERT. When a term occurs for the first time, it is added to the dictionary (best implemented as a hash), and a new postings list is created (line 6). The call in line 7 returns this postings list for subsequent occurrences of the term. A difference between BSBI and SPIMI is that SPIMI adds a posting directly to its postings list (line 10). Instead of first collecting all termID-docID pairs and then sorting them (as we did in BSBI), each postings list is dynamic (i.e., its size is adjusted as it grows) and it is immediately available to collect postings. This has two advantages: It is faster because there is no sorting required, and it saves memory because we keep track of the term a postings list belongs to, so the termIDs of postings need not be stored. As a result, the blocks that individual calls of SPIMI-INVERT can process are much larger and the index construction process as a whole is more efficient. Because we do not know how large the postings list of a term will be when we first encounter it, we allocate space for a short postings list initially and double the space each time it is full (lines 8-9). This means that some memory is wasted, which counteracts the memory savings from the omission of termIDs in intermediate data structures. However, the overall memory requirements for the dynamically constructed index of a block in SPIMI are still lower than in BSBI. When memory has been exhausted, we write the index of the block (which consists of the dictionary and the postings lists) to disk (line 12). We have to sort the terms (line 11) before doing this because we want to write postings lists in lexicographic order to facilitate the final merging step. If each block's postings lists were written in unsorted order, merging blocks could not be accomplished by a simple linear scan through each block. Each call of SPIMI-INVERT writes a block to disk, just as in BSBI. The last step of SPIMI (corresponding to line 7 in Figure 4.2 ; not shown in Figure 4.4 ) is then to merge the blocks into the final inverted index. In addition to constructing a new dictionary structure for each block and eliminating the expensive sorting step, SPIMI has a third important component: compression. Both the postings and the dictionary terms can be stored compactly on disk if we employ compression. Compression increases the efficiency of the algorithm further because we can process even larger blocks, and because the individual blocks require less space on disk. We refer readers to the literature for this aspect of the algorithm (Section 4.7 ). The time complexity of SPIMI is because no sorting of tokens is required and all operations are at most linear in the size of the collection.
iir_4_4	Distributed indexing  clusters   distributed indexing  distributed index term-partitioned index . Most large search engines prefer a document-partitioned index (which can be easily generated from a term-partitioned index). We discuss this topic further in Section 20.3 (page ). The distributed index construction method we describe in this section is an application of MapReduce , a general architecture for distributed computing. MapReduce is designed for large computer clusters. The point of a cluster is to solve large computing problems on cheap commodity machines or nodes that are built from standard parts (processor, memory, disk) as opposed to on a supercomputer with specialized hardware. Although hundreds or thousands of machines are available in such clusters, individual machines can fail at any time. One requirement for robust distributed indexing is, therefore, that we divide the work up into chunks that we can easily assign and - in case of failure - reassign. A master node directs the process of assigning and reassigning tasks to individual worker nodes. The map and reduce phases of MapReduce split up the computing job into chunks that standard machines can process in a short time. The various steps of MapReduce are shown in Figure 4.5 and an example on a collection consisting of two documents is shown in Figure 4.6 . First, the input data, in our case a collection of web pages, are split into splits where the size of the split is chosen to ensure that the work can be distributed evenly (chunks should not be too large) and efficiently (the total number of chunks we need to manage should not be too large); 16 or 64 MB are good sizes in distributed indexing. Splits are not preassigned to machines, but are instead assigned by the master node on an ongoing basis: As a machine finishes processing one split, it is assigned the next one. If a machine dies or becomes a laggard due to hardware problems, the split it is working on is simply reassigned to another machine.  Figure 4.5: An example of distributed indexing with MapReduce. Adapted from Dean and Ghemawat (2004). In general, MapReduce breaks a large computing problem into smaller parts by recasting it in terms of manipulation of key-value pairs . For indexing, a key-value pair has the form (termID,docID). In distributed indexing, the mapping from terms to termIDs is also distributed and therefore more complex than in single-machine indexing. A simple solution is to maintain a (perhaps precomputed) mapping for frequent terms that is copied to all nodes and to use terms directly (instead of termIDs) for infrequent terms. We do not address this problem here and assume that all nodes share a consistent term termID mapping. The map phase of MapReduce consists of mapping splits of the input data to key-value pairs. This is the same parsing task we also encountered in BSBI and SPIMI, and we therefore call the machines that execute the map phase parsers . Each parser writes its output to local intermediate files, the segment files (shown as in Figure 4.5 ). For the reduce phase , we want all values for a given key to be stored close together, so that they can be read and processed quickly. This is achieved by partitioning the keys into term partitions and having the parsers write key-value pairs for each term partition into a separate segment file. In Figure 4.5 , the term partitions are according to first letter: a-f, g-p, q-z, and . (We chose these key ranges for ease of exposition. In general, key ranges need not correspond to contiguous terms or termIDs.) The term partitions are defined by the person who operates the indexing system (Exercise 4.6 ). The parsers then write corresponding segment files, one for each term partition. Each term partition thus corresponds to segments files, where is the number of parsers. For instance, Figure 4.5 shows three a-f segment files of the a-f partition, corresponding to the three parsers shown in the figure. Collecting all values (here: docIDs) for a given key (here: termID) into one list is the task of the inverters in the reduce phase. The master assigns each term partition to a different inverter - and, as in the case of parsers, reassigns term partitions in case of failing or slow inverters. Each term partition (corresponding to segment files, one on each parser) is processed by one inverter. We assume here that segment files are of a size that a single machine can handle (Exercise 4.6 ). Finally, the list of values is sorted for each key and written to the final sorted postings list (``postings'' in the figure). (Note that postings in Figure 4.6 include term frequencies, whereas each posting in the other sections of this chapter is simply a docID without term frequency information.) The data flow is shown for a-f in Figure 4.5 . This completes the construction of the inverted index. Parsers and inverters are not separate sets of machines. The master identifies idle machines and assigns tasks to them. The same machine can be a parser in the map phase and an inverter in the reduce phase. And there are often other jobs that run in parallel with index construction, so in between being a parser and an inverter a machine might do some crawling or another unrelated task. To minimize write times before inverters reduce the data, each parser writes its segment files to its local disk. In the reduce phase, the master communicates to an inverter the locations of the relevant segment files (e.g., of the segment files of the a-f partition). Each segment file only requires one sequential read because all data relevant to a particular inverter were written to a single segment file by the parser. This setup minimizes the amount of network traffic needed during indexing.  Map and reduce functions in MapReduce. In general, the map function produces a list of key-value pairs. All values for a key are collected into one list in the reduce phase. This list is then processed further. The instantiations of the two functions and an example are shown for index construction. Because the map phase processes documents in a distributed fashion, termID-docID pairs need not be ordered correctly initially as in this example. The example shows terms instead of termIDs for better readability. We abbreviate Caesar as C and conquered as c'ed. Figure 4.6 shows the general schema of the MapReduce functions. Input and output are often lists of key-value pairs themselves, so that several MapReduce jobs can run in sequence. In fact, this was the design of the Google indexing system in 2004. What we describe in this section corresponds to only one of five to ten MapReduce operations in that indexing system. Another MapReduce operation transforms the term-partitioned index we just created into a document-partitioned one. MapReduce offers a robust and conceptually simple framework for implementing index construction in a distributed environment. By providing a semiautomatic method for splitting index construction into smaller tasks, it can scale to almost arbitrarily large collections, given computer clusters of sufficient size. Exercises. For splits, segments, and term partitions, how long would distributed index creation take for Reuters-RCV1 in a MapReduce architecture? Base your assumptions about cluster machines on Table 4.1 .
iir_4_5	Dynamic indexing Thus far, we have assumed that the document collection is static. This is fine for collections that change infrequently or never (e.g., the Bible or Shakespeare). But most collections are modified frequently with documents being added, deleted, and updated. This means that new terms need to be added to the dictionary, and postings lists need to be updated for existing terms. The simplest way to achieve this is to periodically reconstruct the index from scratch. This is a good solution if the number of changes over time is small and a delay in making new documents searchable is acceptable - and if enough resources are available to construct a new index while the old one is still available for querying. If there is a requirement that new documents be included quickly, one solution is to maintain two indexes: a large main index and a small auxiliary index that stores new documents. The auxiliary index is kept in memory. Searches are run across both indexes and results merged. Deletions are stored in an invalidation bit vector. We can then filter out deleted documents before returning the search result. Documents are updated by deleting and reinserting them. Each time the auxiliary index becomes too large, we merge it into the main index. The cost of this merging operation depends on how we store the index in the file system. If we store each postings list as a separate file, then the merge simply consists of extending each postings list of the main index by the corresponding postings list of the auxiliary index. In this scheme, the reason for keeping the auxiliary index is to reduce the number of disk seeks required over time. Updating each document separately requires up to disk seeks, where is the average size of the vocabulary of documents in the collection. With an auxiliary index, we only put additional load on the disk when we merge auxiliary and main indexes. Unfortunately, the one-file-per-postings-list scheme is infeasible because most file systems cannot efficiently handle very large numbers of files. The simplest alternative is to store the index as one large file, that is, as a concatenation of all postings lists. In reality, we often choose a compromise between the two extremes (Section 4.7 ). To simplify the discussion, we choose the simple option of storing the index as one large file here. In this scheme, we process each posting times because we touch it during each of merges where is the size of the auxiliary index and the total number of postings. Thus, the overall time complexity is . (We neglect the representation of terms here and consider only the docIDs. For the purpose of time complexity, a postings list is simply a list of docIDs.)  Figure: Logarithmic merging. Each token (termID,docID) is initially added to in-memory index by LM ERGEA DDT OKEN. L OGARITHMICM ERGE initializes and . We can do better than by introducing indexes , , , ...of size , , .... Postings percolate up this sequence of indexes and are processed only once on each level. This scheme is called logarithmic merging (Figure 4.7 ). As before, up to postings are accumulated in an in-memory auxiliary index, which we call . When the limit is reached, the postings in are transferred to a new index that is created on disk. The next time is full, it is merged with to create an index of size . Then is either stored as (if there isn't already an ) or merged with into (if exists); and so on. We service search requests by querying in-memory and all currently valid indexes on disk and merging the results. Readers familiar with the binomial heap data structure will recognize its similarity with the structure of the inverted indexes in logarithmic merging. Overall index construction time is because each posting is processed only once on each of the levels. We trade this efficiency gain for a slow down of query processing; we now need to merge results from indexes as opposed to just two (the main and auxiliary indexes). As in the auxiliary index scheme, we still need to merge very large indexes occasionally (which slows down the search system during the merge), but this happens less frequently and the indexes involved in a merge on average are smaller. Having multiple indexes complicates the maintenance of collection-wide statistics. For example, it affects the spelling correction algorithm in Section 3.3 (page ) that selects the corrected alternative with the most hits. With multiple indexes and an invalidation bit vector, the correct number of hits for a term is no longer a simple lookup. In fact, all aspects of an IR system - index maintenance, query processing, distribution, and so on - are more complex in logarithmic merging. Because of this complexity of dynamic indexing, some large search engines adopt a reconstruction-from-scratch strategy. They do not construct indexes dynamically. Instead, a new index is built from scratch periodically. Query processing is then switched from the new index and the old index is deleted. Exercises. For and , perform a step-by-step simulation of the algorithm in Figure 4.7 . Create a table that shows, for each point in time at which tokens have been processed ( ), which of the three indexes are in use. The first three lines of the table are given below.         2 0 0 0 0     4 0 0 0 1     6 0 0 1 0  
iir_4_6	Other types of indexes In the indexes we have considered so far, postings lists are ordered with respect to docID. As we see in Chapter 5, this is advantageous for compression - instead of docIDs we can compress smaller gaps between IDs, thus reducing space requirements for the index. However, this structure for the index is not optimal when we build ranked (Chapters 6 7 ) - as opposed to Boolean - retrieval systems . In ranked retrieval, postings are often ordered according to weight or impact , with the highest-weighted postings occurring first. With this organization, scanning of long postings lists during query processing can usually be terminated early when weights have become so small that any further documents can be predicted to be of low similarity to the query (see Chapter 6 ). In a docID-sorted index, new documents are always inserted at the end of postings lists. In an impact-sorted index impactordered, the insertion can occur anywhere, thus complicating the update of the inverted index. Security is an important consideration for retrieval systems in corporations. A low-level employee should not be able to find the salary roster of the corporation, but authorized managers need to be able to search for it. Users' results lists must not contain documents they are barred from opening; the very existence of a document can be sensitive information.  Figure: A user-document matrix for access control lists. Element is 1 if user has access to document and 0 otherwise. During query processing, a user's access postings list is intersected with the results list returned by the text part of the index. User authorization is often mediated through access control lists or ACLs. ACLs can be dealt with in an information retrieval system by representing each document as the set of users that can access them (Figure 4.8 ) and then inverting the resulting user-document matrix. The inverted ACL index has, for each user, a ``postings list'' of documents they can access - the user's access list. Search results are then intersected with this list. However, such an index is difficult to maintain when access permissions change - we discussed these difficulties in the context of incremental indexing for regular postings lists in Section 4.5. It also requires the processing of very long postings lists for users with access to large document subsets. User membership is therefore often verified by retrieving access information directly from the file system at query time - even though this slows down retrieval. We discussed indexes for storing and retrieving terms (as opposed to documents) in Chapter 3 . Exercises. Can spelling correction compromise document-level security? Consider the case where a spelling correction is based on documents to which the user does not have access. Exercises. Total index construction time in blocked sort-based indexing is broken down in Table 4.3.

Choose a block size that is realistic for current technology (remember that a block should easily fit into main memory). How many blocks do you need? Assume that we have a collection of modest size whose index can be constructed with the simple in-memory indexing algorithm in Figure 1.4 (page ). For this collection, compare memory, disk and time requirements of the simple algorithm in Figure 1.4 and blocked sort-based indexing. Assume that machines in MapReduce have 100 GB of disk space each. Assume further that the postings list of the term the has a size of 200 GB. Then the MapReduce algorithm as described cannot be run to construct the index. How would you modify MapReduce so that it can handle this case? For optimal load balancing, the inverters in MapReduce must get segmented postings files of similar sizes. For a new collection, the distribution of key-value pairs may not be known in advance. How would you solve this problem? Apply MapReduce to the problem of counting how often each term occurs in a set of files. Specify map and reduce operations for this task. Write down an example along the lines of Figure 4.6 . We claimed (on page 4.5 ) that an auxiliary index can impair the quality of collection statistics. An example is the term weighting method idf , which is defined as where is the total number of documents and is the number of documents that term occurs in idf. Show that even a small auxiliary index can cause significant error in idf when it is computed on the main index only. Consider a rare term that suddenly occurs frequently (e.g., Flossie as in Tropical Storm Flossie).
iir_4_7	References and further reading Witten et al. (1999, Chapter 5) present an extensive treatment of the subject of index construction and additional indexing algorithms with different tradeoffs of memory, disk space, and time. In general, blocked sort-based indexing does well on all three counts. However, if conserving memory or disk space is the main criterion, then other algorithms may be a better choice. See Witten et al. (1999), Tables 5.4 and 5.5; BSBI is closest to ``sort-based multiway merge,'' but the two algorithms differ in dictionary structure and use of compression. Moffat and Bell (1995) show how to construct an index ``in situ,'' that is, with disk space usage close to what is needed for the final index and with a minimum of additional temporary files (cf. also Harman and Candela (1990)). They give Lesk (1988) and Somogyi (1990) credit for being among the first to employ sorting for index construction. The SPIMI method in Section 4.3 is from (Heinz and Zobel, 2003). We have simplified several aspects of the algorithm, including compression and the fact that each term's data structure also contains, in addition to the postings list, its document frequency and house keeping information. We recommend Heinz and Zobel (2003) and Zobel and Moffat (2006) as up-do-date, in-depth treatments of index construction. Other algorithms with good scaling properties with respect to vocabulary size require several passes through the data, e.g., FAST-INV (Harman et al., 1992, Fox and Lee, 1991). The MapReduce architecture was introduced by Dean and Ghemawat (2004). An open source implementation of MapReduce is available at http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/. Ribeiro-Neto et al. (1999) and Melnik et al. (2001) describe other approaches to distributed indexing. Introductory chapters on distributed IR are (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, Chapter 9) and (Grossman and Frieder, 2004, Chapter 8). See also Callan (2000). Lester et al. (2005) and Büttcher and Clarke (2005a) analyze the properties of logarithmic merging and compare it with other construction methods. One of the first uses of this method was in Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org). Other dynamic indexing methods are discussed by Büttcher et al. (2006) and Lester et al. (2006). The latter paper also discusses the strategy of replacing the old index by one built from scratch. Heinz et al. (2002) compare data structures for accumulating the vocabulary in memory. Büttcher and Clarke (2005b) discuss security models for a common inverted index for multiple users. A detailed characterization of the Reuters-RCV1 collection can be found in (Lewis et al., 2004).

iir_5	Index compression Chapter 1 introduced the dictionary and the inverted index as the central data structures in information retrieval (IR). In this chapter, we employ a number of compression techniques for dictionary and inverted index that are essential for efficient IR systems. One benefit of compression is immediately clear. We need less disk space. As we will see, compression ratios of 1:4 are easy to achieve, potentially cutting the cost of storing the index by 75%. There are two more subtle benefits of compression. The first is increased use of caching. Search systems use some parts of the dictionary and the index much more than others. For example, if we cache the postings list of a frequently used query term , then the computations necessary for responding to the one-term query can be entirely done in memory. With compression, we can fit a lot more information into main memory. Instead of having to expend a disk seek when processing a query with , we instead access its postings list in memory and decompress it. As we will see below, there are simple and efficient decompression methods, so that the penalty of having to decompress the postings list is small. As a result, we are able to decrease the response time of the IR system substantially. Because memory is a more expensive resource than disk space, increased speed owing to caching - rather than decreased space requirements - is often the prime motivator for compression. The second more subtle advantage of compression is faster transfer of data from disk to memory. Efficient decompression algorithms run so fast on modern hardware that the total time of transferring a compressed chunk of data from disk and then decompressing it is usually less than transferring the same chunk of data in uncompressed form. For instance, we can reduce input/output (I/O) time by loading a much smaller compressed postings list, even when you add on the cost of decompression. So, in most cases, the retrieval system runs faster on compressed postings lists than on uncompressed postings lists. If the main goal of compression is to conserve disk space, then the speed of compression algorithms is of no concern. But for improved cache utilization and faster disk-to-memory transfer, decompression speeds must be high. The compression algorithms we discuss in this chapter are highly efficient and can therefore serve all three purposes of index compression. In this chapter, we define a posting as a docID in a postings list. For example, the postings list (6; 20, 45, 100), where 6 is the termID of the list's term, contains three postings. As discussed in Section 2.4.2 (page ), postings in most search systems also contain frequency and position information; but we will only consider simple docID postings here. See Section 5.4 for references on compressing frequencies and positions. This chapter first gives a statistical characterization of the distribution of the entities we want to compress - terms and postings in large collections (Section 5.1 ). We then look at compression of the dictionary, using the dictionary-as-a-string method and blocked storage (Section 5.2 ). Section 5.3 describes two techniques for compressing the postings file, variable byte encoding and encoding.   Subsections Statistical properties of terms in information retrieval Heaps' law: Estimating the number of terms Zipf's law: Modeling the distribution of terms Dictionary compression Dictionary as a string Blocked storage Postings file compression Variable byte codes Gamma codes References and further reading
iir_5_1	Statistical properties of terms in information retrieval As in the last chapter, we use Reuters-RCV1 as our model collection (see Table 4.2 , page 4.2 ). We give some term and postings statistics for the collection in Table 5.1 . ``'' indicates the reduction in size from the previous line. ``T%'' is the cumulative reduction from unfiltered. The table shows the number of terms for different levels of preprocessing (column 2). The number of terms is the main factor in determining the size of the dictionary. The number of nonpositional postings (column 3) is an indicator of the expected size of the nonpositional index of the collection. The expected size of a positional index is related to the number of positions it must encode (column 4). In general, the statistics in Table 5.1 show that preprocessing affects the size of the dictionary and the number of nonpositional postings greatly. Stemming and case folding reduce the number of (distinct) terms by 17% each and the number of nonpositional postings by 4% and 3%, respectively. The treatment of the most frequent words is also important. The rule of 30 states that the 30 most common words account for 30% of the tokens in written text (31% in the table). Eliminating the 150 most common words from indexing (as stop words; cf. Section 2.2.2 , page 2.2.2 ) cuts 25% to 30% of the nonpositional postings. But, although a stop list of 150 words reduces the number of postings by a quarter or more, this size reduction does not carry over to the size of the compressed index. As we will see later in this chapter, the postings lists of frequent words require only a few bits per posting after compression.   Table 5.1: The effect of preprocessing on the number of terms, nonpositional postings, and tokens for Reuters-RCV1. `` '' indicates the reduction in size from the previous line, except that ``30 stop words'' and ``150 stop words'' both use ``case folding'' as their reference line. ``T%'' is the cumulative (``total'') reduction from unfiltered. We performed stemming with the Porter stemmer (Chapter 2 , page 2.2.4 ).                 tokens (number of position       (distinct) terms nonpositional postings entries in postings)                   number T% number T% number T%     unfiltered 484,494     109,971,179     197,879,290         no numbers 473,723 2 2 100,680,242 8 8 179,158,204 9 9     case folding 391,523 17 19 96,969,056 3 12 179,158,204 0 9     30 stop words 391,493 0 19 83,390,443 14 24 121,857,825 31 38     150 stop words 391,373 0 19 67,001,847 30 39 94,516,599 47 52     stemming 322,383 17 33 63,812,300 4 42 94,516,599 0 52    The deltas in the table are in a range typical of large collections. Note, however, that the percentage reductions can be very different for some text collections. For example, for a collection of web pages with a high proportion of French text, a lemmatizer for French reduces vocabulary size much more than the Porter stemmer does for an English-only collection because French is a morphologically richer language than English. The compression techniques we describe in the remainder of this chapter are lossless , that is, all information is preserved. Better compression ratios can be achieved with lossy compression , which discards some information. Case folding, stemming, and stop word elimination are forms of lossy compression. Similarly, the vector space model (Chapter 6 ) and dimensionality reduction techniques like latent semantic indexing (Chapter 18 ) create compact representations from which we cannot fully restore the original collection. Lossy compression makes sense when the ``lost'' information is unlikely ever to be used by the search system. For example, web search is characterized by a large number of documents, short queries, and users who only look at the first few pages of results. As a consequence, we can discard postings of documents that would only be used for hits far down the list. Thus, there are retrieval scenarios where lossy methods can be used for compression without any reduction in effectiveness. Before introducing techniques for compressing the dictionary, we want to estimate the number of distinct terms in a collection. It is sometimes said that languages have a vocabulary of a certain size. The second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines more than 600,000 words. But the vocabulary of most large collections is much larger than the OED. The OED does not include most names of people, locations, products, or scientific entities like genes. These names need to be included in the inverted index, so our users can search for them.   Subsections Heaps' law: Estimating the number of terms Zipf's law: Modeling the distribution of terms
iir_5_1_1	Heaps' law: Estimating the number of terms  Heaps' law.Vocabulary size as a function of collection size (number of tokens) for Reuters-RCV1. For these data, the dashed line is the best least-squares fit. Thus, and . A better way of getting a handle on is Heaps' law , which estimates vocabulary size as a function of collection size: (1)       5.1     (2)  The parameter is quite variable because vocabulary growth depends a lot on the nature of the collection and how it is processed. Case-folding and stemming reduce the growth rate of the vocabulary, whereas including numbers and spelling errors increase it. Regardless of the values of the parameters for a particular collection, Heaps' law suggests that (i) the dictionary size continues to increase with more documents in the collection, rather than a maximum vocabulary size being reached, and (ii) the size of the dictionary is quite large for large collections. These two hypotheses have been empirically shown to be true of large text collections (Section 5.4 ). So dictionary compression is important for an effective information retrieval system.
iir_5_1_2	Zipf's law: Modeling the distribution of terms 5.3 A commonly used model of the distribution of terms in a collection is Zipf's law . It states that, if is the most common term in the collection, is the next most common, and so on, then the collection frequency of the th most common term is proportional to :     (3)    3 Equivalently, we can write Zipf's law as or as where and is a constant to be defined in Section 5.3.2 . It is therefore a power law with exponent . See Chapter 19 , page 19.2.1 , for another power law, a law characterizing the distribution of links on web pages.  Zipf's law for Reuters-RCV1. Frequency is plotted as a function of frequency rank for the terms in the collection. The line is the distribution predicted by Zipf's law (weighted least-squares fit; intercept is 6.95). The log-log graph in Figure 5.2 plots the collection frequency of a term as a function of its rank for Reuters-RCV1. A line with slope -1, corresponding to the Zipf function , is also shown. The fit of the data to the law is not particularly good, but good enough to serve as a model for term distributions in our calculations in Section 5.3 . Exercises. Assuming one machine word per posting, what is the size of the uncompressed (nonpositional) index for different tokenizations based on Table 5.1 ? How do these numbers compare with Table 5.6 ?
iir_5_2	Dictionary compression This section presents a series of dictionary data structures that achieve increasingly higher compression ratios. The dictionary is small compared with the postings file as suggested by Table 5.1 . So why compress it if it is responsible for only a small percentage of the overall space requirements of the IR system? One of the primary factors in determining the response time of an IR system is the number of disk seeks necessary to process a query. If parts of the dictionary are on disk, then many more disk seeks are necessary in query evaluation. Thus, the main goal of compressing the dictionary is to fit it in main memory, or at least a large portion of it, to support high query throughput. Although dictionaries of very large collections fit into the memory of a standard desktop machine, this is not true of many other application scenarios. For example, an enterprise search server for a large corporation may have to index a multiterabyte collection with a comparatively large vocabulary because of the presence of documents in many different languages. We also want to be able to design search systems for limited hardware such as mobile phones and onboard computers. Other reasons for wanting to conserve memory are fast startup time and having to share resources with other applications. The search system on your PC must get along with the memory-hogging word processing suite you are using at the same time.  Figure 5.3: Storing the dictionary as an array of fixed-width entries.   Subsections Dictionary as a string Blocked storage
iir_5_2_1	Dictionary as a string 5.3  For Reuters-RCV1, we need for storing the dictionary in this scheme.  Dictionary-as-a-string storage.Pointers mark the end of the preceding term and the beginning of the next. For example, the first three terms in this example are systile, syzygetic, and syzygial. Using fixed-width entries for terms is clearly wasteful. The average length of a term in English is about eight characters icompresstb1, so on average we are wasting twelve characters (or 24 bytes) in the fixed-width scheme. Also, we have no way of storing terms with more than twenty characters like hydrochlorofluorocarbons and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. We can overcome these shortcomings by storing the dictionary terms as one long string of characters, as shown in Figure 5.4 . The pointer to the next term is also used to demarcate the end of the current term. As before, we locate terms in the data structure by way of binary search in the (now smaller) table. This scheme saves us 60% compared to fixed-width storage - 24 bytes on average of the 40 bytes 12 bytes on average of the 20 bytes we allocated for terms before. However, we now also need to store term pointers. The term pointers resolve positions, so they need to be bits or 3 bytes long. In this new scheme, we need for the Reuters-RCV1 dictionary: 4 bytes each for frequency and postings pointer, 3 bytes for the term pointer, and bytes on average for the term. So we have reduced the space requirements by one third from 19.211.2 to 10.87.6 MB.  Blocked storage with four terms per block.The first block consists of systile, syzygetic, syzygial, and syzygy with lengths of seven, nine, eight, and six characters, respectively. Each term is preceded by a byte encoding its length that indicates how many bytes to skip to reach subsequent terms.
iir_5_2_2	Blocked storage   5.5        Figure 5.6: Search of the uncompressed dictionary (a) and a dictionary compressed by blocking with (b). By increasing the block size , we get better compression. However, there is a tradeoff between compression and the speed of term lookup. For the eight-term dictionary in Figure 5.6 , steps in binary search are shown as double lines and steps in list search as simple lines. We search for terms in the uncompressed dictionary by binary search (a). In the compressed dictionary, we first locate the term's block by binary search and then its position within the list by linear search through the block (b). Searching the uncompressed dictionary in (a) takes on average steps, assuming each term is equally likely to come up in a query. For example, finding the two terms, aid and box, takes three and two steps, respectively. With blocks of size in (b), we need steps on average, more. For example, finding den takes one binary search step and two steps through the block. By increasing , we can get the size of the compressed dictionary arbitrarily close to the minimum of , but term lookup becomes prohibitively slow for large values of .   One source of redundancy in the dictionary we have not exploited yet is the fact that consecutive entries in an alphabetically sorted list share common prefixes. This observation leads to front coding (Figure 5.7 ). A common prefix is identified for a subsequence of the term list and then referred to with a special character. In the case of Reuters, front coding saves another 2.41.2 MB, as we found in an experiment. Other schemes with even greater compression rely on minimal perfect hashing, that is, a hash function that maps terms onto without collisions. However, we cannot adapt perfect hashes incrementally because each new term causes a collision and therefore requires the creation of a new perfect hash function. Therefore, they cannot be used in a dynamic environment. Even with the best compression scheme, it may not be feasible to store the entire dictionary in main memory for very large text collections and for hardware with limited memory. If we have to partition the dictionary onto pages that are stored on disk, then we can index the first term of each page using a B-tree. For processing most queries, the search system has to go to disk anyway to fetch the postings. One additional seek for retrieving the term's dictionary page from disk is a significant, but tolerable increase in the time it takes to process a query.

These numbers correspond to line 3 (``case folding'') in Table 5.1 . Document identifiers are bits long. Thus, the size of the collection is about and the size of the uncompressed postings file is . To devise a more efficient representation of the postings file, one that uses fewer than 20 bits per document, we observe that the postings for frequent terms are close together. Imagine going through the documents of a collection one by one and looking for a frequent term like computer. We will find a document containing computer, then we skip a few documents that do not contain it, then there is again a document with the term and so on (see Table 5.3 ). The key idea is that the gaps between postings are short, requiring a lot less space than 20 bits to store. In fact, gaps for the most frequent terms such as the and for are mostly equal to 1. But the gaps for a rare term that occurs only once or twice in a collection (e.g., arachnocentric in Table 5.3 ) have the same order of magnitude as the docIDs and need 20 bits. For an economical representation of this distribution of gaps, we need a variable encoding method that uses fewer bits for short gaps. To encode small numbers in less space than large numbers, we look at two types of methods: bytewise compression and bitwise compression. As the names suggest, these methods attempt to encode gaps with the minimum number of bytes and bits, respectively.   Subsections Variable byte codes Gamma codes

The first bit, the continuation bit, of each byte indicates whether the code ends with this byte (1) or not (0).   docIDs 824 829 215406       gaps   5 214577       VB code 00000110 10111000 10000101 00001101 00001100 10110001      Variable byte (VB) encoding uses an integral number of bytes to encode a gap. The last 7 bits of a byte are ``payload'' and encode part of the gap. The first bit of the byte is a continuation bit . It is set to 1 for the last byte of the encoded gap and to 0 otherwise. To decode a variable byte code, we read a sequence of bytes with continuation bit 0 terminated by a byte with continuation bit 1. We then extract and concatenate the 7-bit parts. Figure 5.8 gives pseudocode for VB encoding and decoding and Table 5.4 an example of a VB-encoded postings list. With VB compression, the size of the compressed index for Reuters-RCV1 is 116 MB as we verified in an experiment. This is a more than 50% reduction of the size of the uncompressed index (see Table 5.6 ). The idea of VB encoding can also be applied to larger or smaller units than bytes: 32-bit words, 16-bit words, and 4-bit words or nibbles . Larger words further decrease the amount of bit manipulation necessary at the cost of less effective (or no) compression. Word sizes smaller than bytes get even better compression ratios at the cost of more bit manipulation. In general, bytes offer a good compromise between compression ratio and speed of decompression. For most IR systems variable byte codes offer an excellent tradeoff between time and space. They are also simple to implement - most of the alternatives referred to in Section 5.4 are more complex. But if disk space is a scarce resource, we can achieve better compression ratios by using bit-level encodings, in particular two closely related encodings: codes, which we will turn to next, and codes (Exercise 5.3.2 ).

Bit-level codes adapt the length of the code on the finer grained bit level. The simplest bit-level code is unary code . The unary code of is a string of 1s followed by a 0 (see the first two columns of Table 5.5 ). Obviously, this is not a very efficient code, but it will come in handy in a moment. How efficient can a code be in principle? Assuming the gaps with are all equally likely, the optimal encoding uses bits for each . So some gaps ( in this case) cannot be encoded with fewer than bits. Our goal is to get as close to this lower bound as possible. A method that is within a factor of optimal is encoding . codes implement variable-length encoding by splitting the representation of a gap into a pair of length and offset. Offset is in binary, but with the leading 1 removed. For example, for 13 (binary 1101) offset is 101. Length encodes the length of offset in unary code. For 13, the length of offset is 3 bits, which is 1110 in unary. The code of 13 is therefore 1110101, the concatenation of length 1110 and offset 101. The right hand column of Table 5.5 gives additional examples of codes. A code is decoded by first reading the unary code up to the 0 that terminates it, for example, the four bits 1110 when decoding 1110101. Now we know how long the offset is: 3 bits. The offset 101 can then be read correctly and the 1 that was chopped off in encoding is prepended: 101 1101 = 13. The length of offset is bits and the length of length is bits, so the length of the entire code is bits. codes are always of odd length and they are within a factor of 2 of what we claimed to be the optimal encoding length . We derived this optimum from the assumption that the gaps between and are equiprobable. But this need not be the case. In general, we do not know the probability distribution over gaps a priori.  Figure 5.9: Entropy as a function of for a sample space with two outcomes and .      entropy   (4)    5.9         It can be shown that the lower bound for the expected length of a code is if certain conditions hold (see the references). It can further be shown that for , encoding is within a factor of 3 of this optimal encoding, approaching 2 for large : (5)        universal In addition to universality, codes have two other properties that are useful for index compression. First, they are prefix free , namely, no code is the prefix of another. This means that there is always a unique decoding of a sequence of codes - and we do not need delimiters between them, which would decrease the efficiency of the code. The second property is that codes are parameter free . For many other efficient codes, we have to fit the parameters of a model (e.g., the binomial distribution) to the distribution of gaps in the index. This complicates the implementation of compression and decompression. For instance, the parameters need to be stored and retrieved. And in dynamic indexing, the distribution of gaps can change, so that the original parameters are no longer appropriate. These problems are avoided with a parameter-free code. How much compression of the inverted index do codes achieve? To answer this question we use Zipf's law, the term distribution model introduced in Section 5.1.2 . According to Zipf's law, the collection frequency is proportional to the inverse of the rank , that is, there is a constant such that:     (6)       (7)     (8)         harmonic number     (9)       (10)  4.2  Figure 5.10: Stratification of terms for estimating the size of a encoded inverted index.            5.10 Encoding the gaps of size with codes, the number of bits needed for the postings list of a term in the th block (corresponding to one row in the figure) is:            (11)   For Reuters-RCV1, 400,000 and (12)  When we run compression on Reuters-RCV1, the actual size of the compressed index is even lower: 101 MB, a bit more than one tenth of the size of the collection. The reason for the discrepancy between predicted and actual value is that (i) Zipf's law is not a very good approximation of the actual distribution of term frequencies for Reuters-RCV1 and (ii) gaps are not uniform. The Zipf model predicts an index size of 251 MB for the unrounded numbers from Table 4.2 . If term frequencies are generated from the Zipf model and a compressed index is created for these artificial terms, then the compressed size is 254 MB. So to the extent that the assumptions about the distribution of term frequencies are accurate, the predictions of the model are correct.   Table: Index and dictionary compression for Reuters-RCV1. The compression ratio depends on the proportion of actual text in the collection. Reuters-RCV1 contains a large amount of XML markup. Using the two best compression schemes, encoding and blocking with front coding, the ratio compressed index to collection size is therefore especially small for Reuters-RCV1: . .   data structure size in MB   dictionary, fixed-width 19.211.2   dictionary, term pointers into string 10.8 7.6   , with blocking, 10.3 7.1   , with blocking   front coding 7.9 5.9   collection (text, xml markup etc) 3600.0   collection (text) 960.0   term incidence matrix 40,000.0   postings, uncompressed (32-bit words) 400.0   postings, uncompressed (20 bits) 250.0   postings, variable byte encoded 116.0   postings, encoded 101.0  Table 5.6 summarizes the compression techniques covered in this chapter. The term incidence matrix (Figure 1.1 , page 1.1 ) for Reuters-RCV1 has size bits or 40 GB. The numbers were the collection (3600 MB and 960 MB) are for the encoding of RCV1 of CD, which uses one byte per character, not Unicode. codes achieve great compression ratios - about 15% better than variable byte codes for Reuters-RCV1. But they are expensive to decode. This is because many bit-level operations - shifts and masks - are necessary to decode a sequence of codes as the boundaries between codes will usually be somewhere in the middle of a machine word. As a result, query processing is more expensive for codes than for variable byte codes. Whether we choose variable byte or encoding depends on the characteristics of an application, for example, on the relative weights we give to conserving disk space versus maximizing query response time. The compression ratio for the index in Table 5.6 is about 25%: 400 MB (uncompressed, each posting stored as a 32-bit word) versus 101 MB () and 116 MB (VB). This shows that both and VB codes meet the objectives we stated in the beginning of the chapter. Index compression substantially improves time and space efficiency of indexes by reducing the amount of disk space needed, increasing the amount of information that can be kept in the cache, and speeding up data transfers from disk to memory. Exercises. Compute variable byte codes for the numbers in Tables 5.3 5.5 . Compute variable byte and codes for the postings list 777, 17743, 294068, 31251336. Use gaps instead of docIDs where possible. Write binary codes in 8-bit blocks. Consider the postings list with a corresponding list of gaps . Assume that the length of the postings list is stored separately, so the system knows when a postings list is complete. Using variable byte encoding: (i) What is the largest gap you can encode in 1 byte? (ii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 2 bytes? (iii) How many bytes will the above postings list require under this encoding? (Count only space for encoding the sequence of numbers.) A little trick is to notice that a gap cannot be of length 0 and that the stuff left to encode after shifting cannot be 0. Based on these observations: (i) Suggest a modification to variable byte encoding that allows you to encode slightly larger gaps in the same amount of space. (ii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 1 byte? (iii) What is the largest gap you can encode in 2 bytes? (iv) How many bytes will the postings list in Exercise 5.3.2 require under this encoding? (Count only space for encoding the sequence of numbers.) From the following sequence of -coded gaps, reconstruct first the gap sequence and then the postings sequence: 1110001110101011111101101111011. codes are relatively inefficient for large numbers (e.g., 1025 in Table 5.5 ) as they encode the length of the offset in inefficient unary code. codes differ from codes in that they encode the first part of the code (length) in code instead of unary code. The encoding of offset is the same. For example, the code of 7 is 10,0,11 (again, we add commas for readability). 10,0 is the code for length (2 in this case) and the encoding of offset (11) is unchanged. (i) Compute the codes for the other numbers in Table 5.5 . For what range of numbers is the code shorter than the code? (ii) code beats variable byte code in Table 5.6 because the index contains stop words and thus many small gaps. Show that variable byte code is more compact if larger gaps dominate. (iii) Compare the compression ratios of code and variable byte code for a distribution of gaps dominated by large gaps. Go through the above calculation of index size and explicitly state all the approximations that were made to arrive at Equation 11. For a collection of your choosing, determine the number of documents and terms and the average length of a document. (i) How large is the inverted index predicted to be by Equation 11? (ii) Implement an indexer that creates a -compressed inverted index for the collection. How large is the actual index? (iii) Implement an indexer that uses variable byte encoding. How large is the variable byte encoded index?

(ii) Index construction is more space efficient when using compression. Would you also expect it to be faster? (i) Show that the size of the vocabulary is finite according to Zipf's law and infinite according to Heaps' law. (ii) Can we derive Heaps' law from Zipf's law?
iir_5_4	References and further reading Heaps' law was discovered by Heaps (1978). See also Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto (1999). A detailed study of vocabulary growth in large collections is (Williams and Zobel, 2005). Zipf's law is due to Zipf (1949). Witten and Bell (1990) investigate the quality of the fit obtained by the law. Other term distribution models, including K mixture and two-poisson model, are discussed by Manning and Schütze (1999, Chapter 15). Carmel et al. (2001), Büttcher and Clarke (2006), Blanco and Barreiro (2007), and Ntoulas and Cho (2007) show that lossy compression can achieve good compression with no or no significant decrease in retrieval effectiveness. Dictionary compression is covered in detail by Witten et al. (1999, Chapter 4), which is recommended as additional reading. Subsection 5.3.1 is based on (Scholer et al., 2002). The authors find that variable byte codes process queries two times faster than either bit-level compressed indexes or uncompressed indexes with a 30% penalty in compression ratio compared with the best bit-level compression method. They also show that compressed indexes can be superior to uncompressed indexes not only in disk usage, but also in query processing speed. Compared with VB codes, ``variable nibble'' codes showed 5% to 10% better compression and up to one third worse effectiveness in one experiment (Anh and Moffat, 2005). Trotman (2003) also recommends using VB codes unless disk space is at a premium. In recent work, Anh and Moffat (2006a;2005) and Zukowski et al. (2006) have constructed word-aligned binary codes that are both faster in decompression and at least as efficient as VB codes. Zhang et al. (2007) investigate the increased effectiveness of caching when a number of different compression techniques for postings lists are used on modern hardware. codes (Exercise 5.3.2 ) and codes were introduced by Elias (1975), who proved that both codes are universal. In addition, codes are asymptotically optimal for . codes perform better than codes if large numbers (greater than 15) dominate. A good introduction to information theory, including the concept of entropy , is (Cover and Thomas, 1991). While Elias codes are only asymptotically optimal, arithmetic codes (Witten et al., 1999, Section 2.4) can be constructed to be arbitrarily close to the optimum for any . Several additional index compression techniques are covered by Witten et al. (1999; Sections 3.3 and 3.4 and Chapter 5). They recommend using parameterized codes for index compression, codes that explicitly model the probability distribution of gaps for each term. For example, they show that Golomb codes achieve better compression ratios than codes for large collections. Moffat and Zobel (1992) compare several parameterized methods, including LLRUN (Fraenkel and Klein, 1985). The distribution of gaps in a postings list depends on the assignment of docIDs to documents. A number of researchers have looked into assigning docIDs in a way that is conducive to the efficient compression of gap sequences (Moffat and Stuiver, 1996; Blandford and Blelloch, 2002; Silvestri et al., 2004; Blanco and Barreiro, 2006; Silvestri, 2007). These techniques assign docIDs in a small range to documents in a cluster where a cluster can consist of all documents in a given time period, on a particular web site, or sharing another property. As a result, when a sequence of documents from a cluster occurs in a postings list, their gaps are small and can be more effectively compressed. Different considerations apply to the compression of term frequencies and word positions than to the compression of docIDs in postings lists. See Scholer et al. (2002) and Zobel and Moffat (2006). Zobel and Moffat (2006) is recommended in general as an in-depth and up-to-date tutorial on inverted indexes, including index compression. This chapter only looks at index compression for Boolean retrieval. For ranked retrieval (Chapter 6 ), it is advantageous to order postings according to term frequency instead of docID. During query processing, the scanning of many postings lists can then be terminated early because smaller weights do not change the ranking of the highest ranked documents found so far. It is not a good idea to precompute and store weights in the index (as opposed to frequencies) because they cannot be compressed as well as integers (see impactordered). Document compression can also be important in an efficient information retrieval system. de Moura et al. (2000) and Brisaboa et al. (2007) describe compression schemes that allow direct searching of terms and phrases in the compressed text, which is infeasible with standard text compression utilities like gzip and compress. Exercises. We have defined unary codes as being ``10'': sequences of 1s terminated by a 0. Interchanging the roles of 0s and 1s yields an equivalent ``01'' unary code. When this 01 unary code is used, the construction of a code can be stated as follows: (1) Write down in binary using bits. (2) Prepend 0s. (i) Encode the numbers in Table 5.5 in this alternative code. (ii) Show that this method produces a well-defined alternative code in the sense that it has the same length and can be uniquely decoded. Unary code is not a universal code in the sense defined above. However, there exists a distribution over gaps for which unary code is optimal. Which distribution is this? Give some examples of terms that violate the assumption that gaps all have the same size (which we made when estimating the space requirements of a -encoded index). What are general characteristics of these terms? Consider a term whose postings list has size , say, . Compare the size of the -compressed gap-encoded postings list if the distribution of the term is uniform (i.e., all gaps have the same size) versus its size when the distribution is not uniform. Which compressed postings list is smaller? Work out the sum in Equation 12 and show it adds up to about 251 MB. Use the numbers in Table 4.2 , but do not round , , and the number of vocabulary blocks.
iir_6	Scoring, term weighting and the vector space model Thus far we have dealt with indexes that support Boolean queries: a document either matches or does not match a query. In the case of large document collections, the resulting number of matching documents can far exceed the number a human user could possibly sift through. Accordingly, it is essential for a search engine to rank-order the documents matching a query. To do this, the search engine computes, for each matching document, a score with respect to the query at hand. In this chapter we initiate the study of assigning a score to a (query, document) pair. This chapter consists of three main ideas. We introduce parametric and zone indexes in Section 6.1 , which serve two purposes. First, they allow us to index and retrieve documents by metadata such as the language in which a document is written. Second, they give us a simple means for scoring (and thereby ranking) documents in response to a query. Next, in Section 6.2 we develop the idea of weighting the importance of a term in a document, based on the statistics of occurrence of the term. In Section 6.3 we show that by viewing each document as a vector of such weights, we can compute a score between a query and each document. This view is known as vector space scoring. 6.4 7 As we develop these ideas, the notion of a query will assume multiple nuances. In Section 6.1 we consider queries in which specific query terms occur in specified regions of a matching document. Beginning Section 6.2 we will in fact relax the requirement of matching specific regions of a document; instead, we will look at so-called free text queries that simply consist of query terms with no specification on their relative order, importance or where in a document they should be found. The bulk of our study of scoring will be in this latter notion of a query being such a set of terms.

iir_6_1	Parametric and zone indexes We have thus far viewed a document as a sequence of terms. In fact, most documents have additional structure. Digital documents generally encode, in machine-recognizable form, certain metadata associated with each document. By metadata, we mean specific forms of data about a document, such as its author(s), title and date of publication. This metadata would generally include fields such as the date of creation and the format of the document, as well the author and possibly the title of the document. The possible values of a field should be thought of as finite - for instance, the set of all dates of authorship. Consider queries of the form ``find documents authored by William Shakespeare in 1601, containing the phrase alas poor Yorick''. Query processing then consists as usual of postings intersections, except that we may merge postings from standard inverted as well as parametric indexes . There is one parametric index for each field (say, date of creation); it allows us to select only the documents matching a date specified in the query. Figure 6.1 illustrates the user's view of such a parametric search. Some of the fields may assume ordered values, such as dates; in the example query above, the year 1601 is one such field value. The search engine may support querying ranges on such ordered values; to this end, a structure like a B-tree may be used for the field's dictionary.  Parametric search.In this example we have a collection with fields allowing us to select publications by zones such as Author and fields such as Language. Zones are similar to fields, except the contents of a zone can be arbitrary free text. Whereas a field may take on a relatively small set of values, a zone can be thought of as an arbitrary, unbounded amount of text. For instance, document titles and abstracts are generally treated as zones. We may build a separate inverted index for each zone of a document, to support queries such as ``find documents with merchant in the title and william in the author list and the phrase gentle rain in the body''. This has the effect of building an index that looks like Figure 6.2. Whereas the dictionary for a parametric index comes from a fixed vocabulary (the set of languages, or the set of dates), the dictionary for a zone index must structure whatever vocabulary stems from the text of that zone.   In fact, we can reduce the size of the dictionary by encoding the zone in which a term occurs in the postings. In Figure 6.3 for instance, we show how occurrences of william in the title and author zones of various documents are encoded. Such an encoding is useful when the size of the dictionary is a concern (because we require the dictionary to fit in main memory). But there is another important reason why the encoding of Figure 6.3 is useful: the efficient computation of scores using a technique we will call weighted zone scoring .  Figure 6.3: Zone index in which the zone is encoded in the postings rather than the dictionary.   Subsections Weighted zone scoring Learning weights The optimal weight g
iir_6_1_1	Weighted zone scoring 6.1 Given a Boolean query and a document , weighted zone scoring assigns to the pair a score in the interval , by computing a linear combination of zone scores, where each zone of the document contributes a Boolean value. More specifically, consider a set of documents each of which has zones. Let such that . For , let be the Boolean score denoting a match (or absence thereof) between and the th zone. For instance, the Boolean score from a zone could be 1 if all the query term(s) occur in that zone, and zero otherwise; indeed, it could be any Boolean function that maps the presence of query terms in a zone to . Then, the weighted zone score is defined to be (13)   ranked Boolean retrieval Worked example. Consider the query shakespeare in a collection in which each document has three zones: author, title and body. The Boolean score function for a zone takes on the value 1 if the query term shakespeare is present in the zone, and zero otherwise. Weighted zone scoring in such a collection would require three weights and , respectively corresponding to the author, title and body zones. Suppose we set and (so that the three weights add up to 1); this corresponds to an application in which a match in the author zone is least important to the overall score, the title zone somewhat more, and the body contributes even more. Thus if the term shakespeare were to appear in the title and body zones but not the author zone of a document, the score of this document would be 0.8. End worked example. How do we implement the computation of weighted zone scores? A simple approach would be to compute the score for each document in turn, adding in all the contributions from the various zones. However, we now show how we may compute weighted zone scores directly from inverted indexes. The algorithm of Figure 6.4 treats the case when the query is a two-term query consisting of query terms and , and the Boolean function is AND: 1 if both query terms are present in a zone and 0 otherwise. Following the description of the algorithm, we describe the extension to more complex queries and Boolean functions.   The reader may have noticed the close similarity between this algorithm and that in Figure 1.6 . Indeed, they represent the same postings traversal, except that instead of merely adding a document to the set of results for a Boolean AND query, we now compute a score for each such document. Some literature refers to the array scores[] above as a set of accumulators . The reason for this will be clear as we consider more complex Boolean functions than the AND; thus we may assign a non-zero score to a document even if it does not contain all query terms.
iir_6_1_2	Learning weights   machine-learned relevance 15  We are provided with a set of training examples, each of which is a tuple consisting of a query and a document , together with a relevance judgment for on . In the simplest form, each relevance judgments is either Relevant or Non-relevant. More sophisticated implementations of the methodology make use of more nuanced judgments. The weights are then ``learned'' from these examples, in order that the learned scores approximate the relevance judgments in the training examples. For weighted zone scoring, the process may be viewed as learning a linear function of the Boolean match scores contributed by the various zones. The expensive component of this methodology is the labor-intensive assembly of user-generated relevance judgments from which to learn the weights, especially in a collection that changes frequently (such as the Web). We now detail a simple example that illustrates how we can reduce the problem of learning the weights to a simple optimization problem. We now consider a simple case of weighted zone scoring, where each document has a title zone and a body zone. Given a query and a document , we use the given Boolean match function to compute Boolean variables and , depending on whether the title (respectively, body) zone of matches query . For instance, the algorithm in Figure 6.4 uses an AND of the query terms for this Boolean function. We will compute a score between 0 and 1 for each (document, query) pair using and by using a constant , as follows:  (14)   training examples      Relevant Non-relevant 6.5 Figure 6.5: An illustration of training examples. For each training example we have Boolean values and that we use to compute a score from (14)  (15)   Relevant Non-relevant   (16)      (17)    17 Picking the best value of in (17) in the formulation of Section 6.1.3 reduces to the problem of minimizing a quadratic function of over the interval . This reduction is detailed in Section 6.1.3 .
iir_6_1_3	The optimal weight g We begin by noting that for any training example for which and , the score computed by Equation 14 is . In similar fashion, we may write down the score computed by Equation 14 for the three other possible combinations of and ; this is summarized in Figure 6.6 .  Figure 6.6: The four possible combinations of and . Let (respectively, ) denote the number of training examples for which and and the editorial judgment is Relevant (respectively, Non-relevant). Then the contribution to the total error in Equation 17 from training examples for which and is (18)    17  (19)  By differentiating Equation 19 with respect to and setting the result to zero, it follows that the optimal value of is (20)  Exercises. When using weighted zone scoring, is it necessary for all zones to use the same Boolean match function? In Example 6.1.1 above with weights and , what are all the distinct score values a document may get? Rewrite the algorithm in Figure 6.4 to the case of more than two query terms. Write pseudocode for the function WeightedZone for the case of two postings lists in Figure 6.4 . Apply Equation 20 to the sample training set in Figure 6.5 to estimate the best value of for this sample. For the value of estimated in Exercise 6.1.3, compute the weighted zone score for each (query, document) example. How do these scores relate to the relevance judgments in Figure 6.5 (quantized to 0/1)? Why does the expression for in (20) not involve training examples in which and have the same value?
iir_6_2	Term frequency and weighting  free text query 1.4 Towards this end, we assign to each term in a document a weight for that term, that depends on the number of occurrences of the term in the document. We would like to compute a score between a query term  and a document , based on the weight of in . The simplest approach is to assign the weight to be equal to the number of occurrences of term  in document . This weighting scheme is referred to as term frequency and is denoted , with the subscripts denoting the term and the document in order. For a document , the set of weights determined by the weights above (or indeed any weighting function that maps the number of occurrences of in to a positive real value) may be viewed as a quantitative digest of that document. In this view of a document, known in the literature as the bag of words model , the exact ordering of the terms in a document is ignored but the number of occurrences of each term is material (in contrast to Boolean retrieval). We only retain information on the number of occurrences of each term. Thus, the document ``Mary is quicker than John'' is, in this view, identical to the document ``John is quicker than Mary''. Nevertheless, it seems intuitive that two documents with similar bag of words representations are similar in content. We will develop this intuition further in Section 6.3 . Before doing so we first study the question: are all words in a document equally important? Clearly not; in Section 2.2.2 (page ) we looked at the idea of stop words - words that we decide not to index at all, and therefore do not contribute in any way to retrieval and scoring.   Subsections Inverse document frequency Tf-idf weighting
iir_6_2_1	Inverse document frequency collection frequency,  Instead, it is more commonplace to use for this purpose the document frequency , defined to be the number of documents in the collection that contain a term . This is because in trying to discriminate between documents for the purpose of scoring it is better to use a document-level statistic (such as the number of documents containing a term) than to use a collection-wide statistic for the term. Figure 6.7: Collection frequency (cf) and document frequency (df) behave differently, as in this example from the Reuters collection. 6.7 How is the document frequency df of a term used to scale its weight? Denoting as usual the total number of documents in a collection by , we define the inverse document frequency of a term as follows:  (21)  Thus the idf of a rare term is high, whereas the idf of a frequent term is likely to be low. Figure 6.8 gives an example of idf's in the Reuters collection of 806,791 documents; in this example logarithms are to the base 10. In fact, as we will see in Exercise 6.2.2 , the precise base of the logarithm is not material to ranking. We will give on page 11.3.3 a justification of the particular form in Equation 21.
iir_6_2_2	Tf-idf weighting We now combine the definitions of term frequency and inverse document frequency, to produce a composite weight for each term in each document. The tf-idf weighting scheme assigns to term a weight in document given by  (22)  In other words, assigns to term a weight in document that is  highest when occurs many times within a small number of documents (thus lending high discriminating power to those documents); lower when the term occurs fewer times in a document, or occurs in many documents (thus offering a less pronounced relevance signal); lowest when the term occurs in virtually all documents. At this point, we may view each document as a vector with one component corresponding to each term in the dictionary, together with a weight for each component that is given by (22). For dictionary terms that do not occur in a document, this weight is zero. This vector form will prove to be crucial to scoring and ranking; we will develop these ideas in Section 6.3 . As a first step, we introduce the overlap score measure: the score of a document is the sum, over all query terms, of the number of times each of the query terms occurs in . We can refine this idea so that we add up not the number of occurrences of each query term in , but instead the tf-idf weight of each term in . (23)  6.3 23 Exercises. Why is the idf of a term always finite? What is the idf of a term that occurs in every document? Compare this with the use of stop word lists. Consider the table of term frequencies for 3 documents denoted Doc1, Doc2, Doc3 in Figure 6.9 . Figure 6.9: Table of tf values for Exercise  6.2.2. Compute the tf-idf weights for the terms car, auto, insurance, best, for each document, using the idf values from Figure 6.8 . Can the tf-idf weight of a term in a document exceed 1? How does the base of the logarithm in (21) affect the score calculation in (23)? How does the base of the logarithm affect the relative scores of two documents on a given query? If the logarithm in (21) is computed base 2, suggest a simple approximation to the idf of a term.
iir_6_3	The vector space model for scoring In Section 6.2 (page ) we developed the notion of a document vector that captures the relative importance of the terms in a document. The representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector space is known as the vector space model and is fundamental to a host of information retrieval operations ranging from scoring documents on a query, document classification and document clustering. We first develop the basic ideas underlying vector space scoring; a pivotal step in this development is the view (Section 6.3.2 ) of queries as vectors in the same vector space as the document collection.   Subsections Dot products Queries as vectors Computing vector scores
iir_6_3_1	Dot products    6.2  bag of words How do we quantify the similarity between two documents in this vector space? A first attempt might consider the magnitude of the vector difference between two document vectors. This measure suffers from a drawback: two documents with very similar content can have a significant vector difference simply because one is much longer than the other. Thus the relative distributions of terms may be identical in the two documents, but the absolute term frequencies of one may be far larger.        cosine similarity      (24)   dot product  inner product     Euclidean lengths         The effect of the denominator of Equation 24 is thus to length-normalize the vectors and to unit vectors and . We can then rewrite (24) as (25)  Worked example. Consider the documents in Figure 6.9 . We now apply Euclidean normalization to the tf values from the table, for each of the three documents in the table. The quantity has the values 30.56, 46.84 and 41.30 respectively for Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3. The resulting Euclidean normalized tf values for these documents are shown in Figure 6.11 .  Figure 6.11: Euclidean normalized tf values for documents in Figure 6.9 . End worked example. Thus, (25) can be viewed as the dot product of the normalized versions of the two document vectors. This measure is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, shown in Figure 6.10 . What use is the similarity measure ? Given a document (potentially one of the in the collection), consider searching for the documents in the collection most similar to . Such a search is useful in a system where a user may identify a document and seek others like it - a feature available in the results lists of search engines as a more like this feature. We reduce the problem of finding the document(s) most similar to to that of finding the with the highest dot products ( values) . We could do this by computing the dot products between and each of , then picking off the highest resulting values.   Worked example. Figure 6.12 shows the number of occurrences of three terms (affection, jealous and gossip) in each of the following three novels: Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility (SaS) and Pride and Prejudice (PaP) and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (WH). Of course, there are many other terms occurring in each of these novels. In this example we represent each of these novels as a unit vector in three dimensions, corresponding to these three terms (only); we use raw term frequencies here, with no idf multiplier. The resulting weights are as shown in Figure 6.13.   Now consider the cosine similarities between pairs of the resulting three-dimensional vectors. A simple computation shows that sim((SAS), (PAP)) is 0.999, whereas sim((SAS), (WH)) is 0.888; thus, the two books authored by Austen (SaS and PaP) are considerably closer to each other than to Brontë's Wuthering Heights. In fact, the similarity between the first two is almost perfect (when restricted to the three terms we consider). Here we have considered tf weights, but we could of course use other term weight functions. End worked example. Viewing a collection of documents as a collection of vectors leads to a natural view of a collection as a term-document matrix and jealousy would under stemming be considered as a single dimension. This matrix view will prove to be useful in Chapter 18 .
iir_6_3_2	Queries as vectors There is a far more compelling reason to represent documents as vectors: we can also view a query as a vector. Consider the query jealous gossip. This query turns into the unit vector on the three coordinates of Figures 6.12 and 6.13. The key idea now: to assign to each document a score equal to the dot product (26)  In the example of Figure 6.13, Wuthering Heights is the top-scoring document for this query with a score of 0.509, with Pride and Prejudice a distant second with a score of 0.085, and Sense and Sensibility last with a score of 0.074. This simple example is somewhat misleading: the number of dimensions in practice will be far larger than three: it will equal the vocabulary size . To summarize, by viewing a query as a ``bag of words'', we are able to treat it as a very short document. As a consequence, we can use the cosine similarity between the query vector and a document vector as a measure of the score of the document for that query. The resulting scores can then be used to select the top-scoring documents for a query. Thus we have (27)  6.3.2 6.4 Computing the cosine similarities between the query vector and each document vector in the collection, sorting the resulting scores and selecting the top documents can be expensive -- a single similarity computation can entail a dot product in tens of thousands of dimensions, demanding tens of thousands of arithmetic operations. In Section 7.1 we study how to use an inverted index for this purpose, followed by a series of heuristics for improving on this. Worked example. We now consider the query best car insurance on a fictitious collection with documents where the document frequencies of auto, best, car and insurance are respectively 5000, 50000, 10000 and 1000.  term query document product   tf df idf tf wf   auto 0 5000 2.3 0 1 1 0.41 0 best 1 50000 1.3 1.3 0 0 0 0 car 1 10000 2.0 2.0 1 1 0.41 0.82 insurance 1 1000 3.0 3.0 2 2 0.82 2.46 In this example the weight of a term in the query is simply the idf (and zero for a term not in the query, such as auto); this is reflected in the column header (the entry for auto is zero because the query does not contain the termauto). For documents, we use tf weighting with no use of idf but with Euclidean normalization. The former is shown under the column headed wf, while the latter is shown under the column headed . Invoking (23) now gives a net score of . End worked example.
iir_6_3_3	Computing vector scores  free text query      7  Figure 6.14: The basic algorithm for computing vector space scores. Figure 6.14 gives the basic algorithm for computing vector space scores. The array Length holds the lengths (normalization factors) for each of the documents, whereas the array Scores holds the scores for each of the documents. When the scores are finally computed in Step 9, all that remains in Step 10 is to pick off the documents with the highest scores. The outermost loop beginning Step 3 repeats the updating of Scores, iterating over each query term in turn. In Step 5 we calculate the weight in the query vector for term . Steps 6-8 update the score of each document by adding in the contribution from term . This process of adding in contributions one query term at a time is sometimes known as term-at-a-time scoring or accumulation, and the elements of the array are therefore known as accumulators . For this purpose, it would appear necessary to store, with each postings entry, the weight of term in document (we have thus far used either tf or tf-idf for this weight, but leave open the possibility of other functions to be developed in Section 6.4 ). In fact this is wasteful, since storing this weight may require a floating point number. Two ideas help alleviate this space problem. First, if we are using inverse document frequency , we need not precompute ; it suffices to store at the head of the postings for . Second, we store the term frequency for each postings entry. Finally, Step 12 extracts the top scores - this requires a priority queue data structure, often implemented using a heap. Such a heap takes no more than comparisons to construct, following which each of the top scores can be extracted from the heap at a cost of comparisons. Note that the general algorithm of Figure 6.14 does not prescribe a specific implementation of how we traverse the postings lists of the various query terms; we may traverse them one term at a time as in the loop beginning at Step 3, or we could in fact traverse them concurrently as in Figure 1.6 . In such a concurrent postings traversal we compute the scores of one document at a time, so that it is sometimes called document-at-a-time scoring. We will say more about this in Section 7.1.5 . Exercises. If we were to stem jealous and jealousy to a common stem before setting up the vector space, detail how the definitions of tf and idf should be modified. Recall the tf-idf weights computed in Exercise 6.2.2. Compute the Euclidean normalized document vectors for each of the documents, where each vector has four components, one for each of the four terms. Verify that the sum of the squares of the components of each of the document vectors in Exercise 6.3.3 is 1 (to within rounding error). Why is this the case? With term weights as computed in Exercise 6.3.3, rank the three documents by computed score for the query car insurance, for each of the following cases of term weighting in the query: The weight of a term is 1 if present in the query, 0 otherwise. Euclidean normalized idf.
iir_6_4_2	Maximum tf normalization        (30)        30  smoothing  13        23   23  The method is unstable in the following sense: a change in the stop word list can dramatically alter term weightings (and therefore ranking). Thus, it is hard to tune. A document may contain an outlier term with an unusually large number of occurrences of that term, not representative of the content of that document. More generally, a document in which the most frequent term appears roughly as often as many other terms should be treated differently from one with a more skewed distribution.
iir_6_4_3	Document and query weighting schemes Equation 27 is fundamental to information retrieval systems that use any form of vector space scoring. Variations from one vector space scoring method to another hinge on the specific choices of weights in the vectors and . Figure 6.15 lists some of the principal weighting schemes in use for each of and , together with a mnemonic for representing a specific combination of weights; this system of mnemonics is sometimes called SMART notation, following the authors of an early text retrieval system. The mnemonic for representing a combination of weights takes the form ddd.qqq where the first triplet gives the term weighting of the document vector, while the second triplet gives the weighting in the query vector. The first letter in each triplet specifies the term frequency component of the weighting, the second the document frequency component, and the third the form of normalization used. It is quite common to apply different normalization functions to and . For example, a very standard weighting scheme is lnc.ltc, where the document vector has log-weighted term frequency, no idf (for both effectiveness and efficiency reasons), and cosine normalization, while the query vector uses log-weighted term frequency, idf weighting, and cosine normalization.
iir_6_4_4	Pivoted normalized document length In Section 6.3.1 we normalized each document vector by the Euclidean length of the vector, so that all document vectors turned into unit vectors. In doing so, we eliminated all information on the length of the original document; this masks some subtleties about longer documents. First, longer documents will - as a result of containing more terms - have higher tf values. Second, longer documents contain more distinct terms. These factors can conspire to raise the scores of longer documents, which (at least for some information needs) is unnatural. Longer documents can broadly be lumped into two categories: (1) verbose documents that essentially repeat the same content - in these, the length of the document does not alter the relative weights of different terms; (2) documents covering multiple different topics, in which the search terms probably match small segments of the document but not all of it - in this case, the relative weights of terms are quite different from a single short document that matches the query terms. Compensating for this phenomenon is a form of document length normalization that is independent of term and document frequencies. To this end, we introduce a form of normalizing the vector representations of documents in the collection, so that the resulting ``normalized'' documents are not necessarily of unit length. Then, when we compute the dot product score between a (unit) query vector and such a normalized document, the score is skewed to account for the effect of document length on relevance. This form of compensation for document length is known as pivoted document length normalization .  Figure 6.16: Pivoted document length normalization. Consider a document collection together with an ensemble of queries for that collection. Suppose that we were given, for each query and for each document , a Boolean judgment of whether or not is relevant to the query ; in Chapter 8 we will see how to procure such a set of relevance judgments for a query ensemble and a document collection. Given this set of relevance judgments, we may compute a probability of relevance as a function of document length, averaged over all queries in the ensemble. The resulting plot may look like the curve drawn in thick lines in Figure 6.16 . To compute this curve, we bucket documents by length and compute the fraction of relevant documents in each bucket, then plot this fraction against the median document length of each bucket. (Thus even though the ``curve'' in Figure 6.16 appears to be continuous, it is in fact a histogram of discrete buckets of document length.) On the other hand, the curve in thin lines shows what might happen with the same documents and query ensemble if we were to use relevance as prescribed by cosine normalization Equation 27 - thus, cosine normalization has a tendency to distort the computed relevance vis-à-vis the true relevance, at the expense of longer documents. The thin and thick curves crossover at a point corresponding to document length , which we refer to as the pivot length; dashed lines mark this point on the and axes. The idea of pivoted document length normalization would then be to ``rotate'' the cosine normalization curve counter-clockwise about so that it more closely matches thick line representing the relevance vs. document length curve. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, we do so by using in Equation 27 a normalization factor for each document vector that is not the Euclidean length of that vector, but instead one that is larger than the Euclidean length for documents of length less than , and smaller for longer documents. To this end, we first note that the normalizing term for in the denominator of Equation 27 is its Euclidean length, denoted . In the simplest implementation of pivoted document length normalization, we use a normalization factor in the denominator that is linear in , but one of slope as in Figure 6.17 . In this figure, the axis represents , while the axis represents possible normalization factors we can use. The thin line depicts the use of cosine normalization. Notice the following aspects of the thick line representing pivoted length normalization: It is linear in the document length and has the form (31) where is the cosine normalization value at which the two curves intersect. Its slope is and (3) it crosses the line at piv. 31  (32)     Figure 6.17: Implementing pivoted document length normalization by linear scaling. Of course, pivoted document length normalization is not appropriate for all applications. For instance, in a collection of answers to frequently asked questions (say, at a customer service website), relevance may have little to do with document length. In other cases the dependency may be more complex than can be accounted for by a simple linear pivoted normalization. In such cases, document length can be used as a feature in the machine learning based scoring approach of Section 6.1.2 . Exercises. One measure of the similarity of two vectors is the Euclidean distance (or distance ) between them: (33) Given a query and documents , we may rank the documents in order of increasing Euclidean distance from . Show that if and the are all normalized to unit vectors, then the rank ordering produced by Euclidean distance is identical to that produced by cosine similarities. Compute the vector space similarity between the query ``digital cameras'' and the document ``digital cameras and video cameras'' by filling out the empty columns in Table 6.1 . Assume , logarithmic term weighting (wf columns) for query and document, idf weighting for the query only and cosine normalization for the document only. Treat and as a stop word. Enter term counts in the tf columns. What is the final similarity score? Table 6.1: Cosine computation for Exercise 6.4.4 .   query document   word tf wf df idf tf wf digital     10,000             video     100,000             cameras     50,000             Show that for the query affection, the relative ordering of the scores of the three documents in Figure 6.13 is the reverse of the ordering of the scores for the query jealous gossip. In turning a query into a unit vector in Figure 6.13, we assigned equal weights to each of the query terms. What other principled approaches are plausible? Consider the case of a query term that is not in the set of indexed terms; thus our standard construction of the query vector results in not being in the vector space created from the collection. How would one adapt the vector space representation to handle this case? Refer to the tf and idf values for four terms and three documents in Exercise 6.2.2. Compute the two top scoring documents on the query best car insurance for each of the following weighing schemes: (i) nnn.atc; (ii) ntc.atc. Suppose that the word coyote does not occur in the collection used in Exercises 6.2.2 and 6.4.4. How would one compute ntc.atc scores for the query coyote insurance?
iir_6_5	References and further reading Chapter 7 develops the computational aspects of vector space scoring. Luhn (1957;1958) describes some of the earliest reported applications of term weighting. His paper dwells on the importance of medium frequency terms (terms that are neither too commonplace nor too rare) and may be thought of as anticipating tf-idf and related weighting schemes. Spärck Jones (1972) builds on this intuition through detailed experiments showing the use of inverse document frequency in term weighting. A series of extensions and theoretical justifications of idf are due to Salton and Buckley (1987) Robertson and Jones (1976), Croft and Harper (1979) and Papineni (2001). Robertson maintains a web page (http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ser/idf.html) containing the history of idf, including soft copies of early papers that predated electronic versions of journal article. Singhal et al. (1996a) develop pivoted document length normalization. Probabilistic language models (Chapter 11 ) develop weighting techniques that are more nuanced than tf-idf; the reader will find this development in Section 11.4.3 . We observed that by assigning a weight for each term in a document, a document may be viewed as a vector of term weights, one for each term in the collection. The SMART information retrieval system at Cornell (Salton, 1971b) due to Salton and colleagues was perhaps the first to view a document as a vector of weights. The basic computation of cosine scores as described in Section 6.3.3 is due to Zobel and Moffat (2006). The two query evaluation strategies term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time are discussed by Turtle and Flood (1995). The SMART notation for tf-idf term weighting schemes in Figure 6.15 is presented in (Singhal et al., 1996b;1995, Salton and Buckley, 1988). Not all versions of the notation are consistent; we most closely follow (Singhal et al., 1996b). A more detailed and exhaustive notation was developed in Moffat and Zobel (1998), considering a larger palette of schemes for term and document frequency weighting. Beyond the notation, Moffat and Zobel (1998) sought to set up a space of feasible weighting functions through which hill-climbing approaches could be used to begin with weighting schemes that performed well, then make local improvements to identify the best combinations. However, they report that such hill-climbing methods failed to lead to any conclusions on the best weighting schemes.
iir_7	Computing scores in a complete search system Chapter 6 developed the theory underlying term weighting in documents for the purposes of scoring, leading up to vector space models and the basic cosine scoring algorithm of Section 6.3.3 (page ). In this chapter we begin in Section 7.1 with heuristics for speeding up this computation; many of these heuristics achieve their speed at the risk of not finding quite the top documents matching the query. Some of these heuristics generalize beyond cosine scoring. With Section 7.1 in place, we have essentially all the components needed for a complete search engine. We therefore take a step back from cosine scoring, to the more general problem of computing scores in a search engine. In Section 7.2 we outline a complete search engine, including indexes and structures to support not only cosine scoring but also more general ranking factors such as query term proximity. We describe how all of the various pieces fit together in Section 7.2.4 . We conclude this chapter with Section 7.3 , where we discuss how the vector space model for free text queries interacts with common query operators.

iir_7_1	Efficient scoring and ranking We begin by recapping the algorithm of Figure 6.14 . For a query such as jealous gossip, two observations are immediate: The unit vector has only two non-zero components. In the absence of any weighting for query terms, these non-zero components are equal - in this case, both equal 0.707. For the purpose of ranking the documents matching this query, we are really interested in the relative (rather than absolute) scores of the documents in the collection. To this end, it suffices to compute the cosine similarity from each document unit vector to (in which all non-zero components of the query vector are set to 1), rather than to the unit vector . For any two documents (34)      6.14  7.1  6.3.3   Figure 7.1: A faster algorithm for vector space scores. Given these scores, the final step before presenting results to a user is to pick out the highest-scoring documents. While one could sort the complete set of scores, a better approach is to use a heap to retrieve only the top documents in order. Where is the number of documents with non-zero cosine scores, constructing such a heap can be performed in comparison steps, following which each of the highest scoring documents can be ``read off'' the heap with comparison steps.   Subsections Inexact top K document retrieval Index elimination Champion lists Static quality scores and ordering Impact ordering Cluster pruning
iir_7_1_1	Inexact top K document retrieval Thus far, we have focused on retrieving precisely the highest-scoring documents for a query. We now consider schemes by which we produce documents that are likely to be among the highest scoring documents for a query. In doing so, we hope to dramatically lower the cost of computing the documents we output, without materially altering the user's perceived relevance of the top results. Consequently, in most applications it suffices to retrieve documents whose scores are very close to those of the best. In the sections that follow we detail schemes that retrieve such documents while potentially avoiding computing scores for most of the documents in the collection. Such inexact top- retrieval is not necessarily, from the user's perspective, a bad thing. The top documents by the cosine measure are in any case not necessarily the best for the query: cosine similarity is only a proxy for the user's perceived relevance. In Sections 7.1.2 -7.1.6 below, we give heuristics using which we are likely to retrieve documents with cosine scores close to those of the top documents. The principal cost in computing the output stems from computing cosine similarities between the query and a large number of documents. Having a large number of documents in contention also increases the selection cost in the final stage of culling the top documents from a heap. We now consider a series of ideas designed to eliminate a large number of documents without computing their cosine scores. The heuristics have the following two-step scheme: Find a set of documents that are contenders, where . does not necessarily contain the top-scoring documents for the query, but is likely to have many documents with scores near those of the top . Return the top-scoring documents in .
iir_7_1_2	Index elimination  We only consider documents containing terms whose idf exceeds a preset threshold. Thus, in the postings traversal, we only traverse the postings for terms with high idf. This has a fairly significant benefit: the postings lists of low-idf terms are generally long; with these removed from contention, the set of documents for which we compute cosines is greatly reduced. One way of viewing this heuristic: low-idf terms are treated as stop words and do not contribute to scoring. For instance, on the query catcher in the rye, we only traverse the postings for catcher and rye. The cutoff threshold can of course be adapted in a query-dependent manner. We only consider documents that contain many (and as a special case, all) of the query terms. This can be accomplished during the postings traversal; we only compute scores for documents containing all (or many) of the query terms. A danger of this scheme is that by requiring all (or even many) query terms to be present in a document before considering it for cosine computation, we may end up with fewer than candidate documents in the output. This issue will discussed further in Section 7.2.1 .
iir_7_1_3	Champion lists champion lists fancy lists top docs        champion list  Now, given a query we create a set as follows: we take the union of the champion lists for each of the terms comprising . We now restrict cosine computation to only the documents in . A critical parameter in this scheme is the value , which is highly application dependent. Intuitively, should be large compared with , especially if we use any form of the index elimination described in Section 7.1.2 . One issue here is that the value is set at the time of index construction, whereas is application dependent and may not be available until the query is received; as a result we may (as in the case of index elimination) find ourselves with a set that has fewer than documents. There is no reason to have the same value of for all terms in the dictionary; it could for instance be set to be higher for rarer terms.
iir_7_1_4	Static quality scores and ordering  static quality scores    static  21 The net score for a document is some combination of together with the query-dependent score induced (say) by (27). The precise combination may be determined by the learning methods of Section 6.1.2 , to be developed further in Section 15.4.1 ; but for the purposes of our exposition here, let us consider a simple sum: (35)   24 First, consider ordering the documents in the postings list for each term by decreasing value of . This allows us to perform the postings intersection algorithm of Figure 1.6 . In order to perform the intersection by a single pass through the postings of each query term, the algorithm of Figure 1.6 relied on the postings being ordered by document IDs. But in fact, we only required that all postings be ordered by a single common ordering; here we rely on the values to provide this common ordering. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2 , where the postings are ordered in decreasing order of .  A static quality-ordered index.In this example we assume that Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3 respectively have static quality scores . The first idea is a direct extension of champion lists: for a well-chosen value , we maintain for each term a global champion list of the documents with the highest values for . The list itself is, like all the postings lists considered so far, sorted by a common order (either by document IDs or by static quality). Then at query time, we only compute the net scores (35) for documents in the union of these global champion lists. Intuitively, this has the effect of focusing on documents likely to have large net scores. We conclude the discussion of global champion lists with one further idea. We maintain for each term two postings lists consisting of disjoint sets of documents, each sorted by values. The first list, which we call high, contains the documents with the highest tf values for . The second list, which we call low, contains all other documents containing . When processing a query, we first scan only the high lists of the query terms, computing net scores for any document on the high lists of all (or more than a certain number of) query terms. If we obtain scores for documents in the process, we terminate. If not, we continue the scanning into the low lists, scoring documents in these postings lists. This idea is developed further in Section 7.2.1 .
iir_7_1_5	Impact ordering 7.1.4 6.3.3  document-at-a-time  6.14  term-at-a-time The idea is to order the documents in the postings list of term by decreasing order of . Thus, the ordering of documents will vary from one postings list to another, and we cannot compute scores by a concurrent traversal of the postings lists of all query terms. Given postings lists ordered by decreasing order of , two ideas have been found to significantly lower the number of documents for which we accumulate scores: (1) when traversing the postings list for a query term , we stop after considering a prefix of the postings list - either after a fixed number of documents have been seen, or after the value of has dropped below a threshold; (2) when accumulating scores in the outer loop of Figure 6.14 , we consider the query terms in decreasing order of idf, so that the query terms likely to contribute the most to the final scores are considered first. This latter idea too can be adaptive at the time of processing a query: as we get to query terms with lower idf, we can determine whether to proceed based on the changes in document scores from processing the previous query term. If these changes are minimal, we may omit accumulation from the remaining query terms, or alternatively process shorter prefixes of their postings lists. These ideas form a common generalization of the methods introduced in Sections 7.1.2 -7.1.4 . We may also implement a version of static ordering in which each postings list is ordered by an additive combination of static and query-dependent scores. We would again lose the consistency of ordering across postings, thereby having to process query terms one at time accumulating scores for all documents as we go along. Depending on the particular scoring function, the postings list for a document may be ordered by other quantities than term frequency; under this more general setting, this idea is known as impact ordering.
iir_7_1_6	Cluster pruning cluster pruning Pick documents at random from the collection. Call these leaders. For each document that is not a leader, we compute its nearest leader. followers   Given a query , find the leader that is closest to . This entails computing cosine similarities from to each of the leaders. The candidate set consists of together with its followers. We compute the cosine scores for all documents in this candidate set. The use of randomly chosen leaders for clustering is fast and likely to reflect the distribution of the document vectors in the vector space: a region of the vector space that is dense in documents is likely to produce multiple leaders and thus a finer partition into sub-regions. This illustrated in Figure 7.3 .  Figure 7.3: Cluster pruning. Variations of cluster pruning introduce additional parameters and , both of which are positive integers. In the pre-processing step we attach each follower to its closest leaders, rather than a single closest leader. At query time we consider the leaders closest to the query . Clearly, the basic scheme above corresponds to the case . Further, increasing or increases the likelihood of finding documents that are more likely to be in the set of true top-scoring documents, at the expense of more computation. We reiterate this approach when describing clustering in Chapter 16 (page 16.1 ). Exercises. We suggested above (Figure 7.2 ) that the postings for static quality ordering be in decreasing order of . Why do we use the decreasing rather than the increasing order? When discussing champion lists, we simply used the documents with the largest tf values to create the champion list for . But when considering global champion lists, we used idf as well, identifying documents with the largest values of . Why do we differentiate between these two cases? If we were to only have one-term queries, explain why the use of global champion lists with suffices for identifying the highest scoring documents. What is a simple modification to this idea if we were to only have -term queries for any fixed integer ? Explain how the common global ordering by values in all high and low lists helps make the score computation efficient. Consider again the data of Exercise 6.4.4 with nnn.atc for the query-dependent scoring. Suppose that we were given static quality scores of 1 for Doc1 and 2 for Doc2. Determine under Equation 35 what ranges of static quality score for Doc3 result in it being the first, second or third result for the query best car insurance. Sketch the frequency-ordered postings for the data in Figure 6.9 . Let the static quality scores for Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3 in Figure 6.11 be respectively 0.25, 0.5 and 1. Sketch the postings for impact ordering when each postings list is ordered by the sum of the static quality score and the Euclidean normalized tf values in Figure 6.11 . The nearest-neighbor problem in the plane is the following: given a set of data points on the plane, we preprocess them into some data structure such that, given a query point , we seek the point in that is closest to in Euclidean distance. Clearly cluster pruning can be used as an approach to the nearest-neighbor problem in the plane, if we wished to avoid computing the distance from to every one of the query points. Devise a simple example on the plane so that with two leaders, the answer returned by cluster pruning is incorrect (it is not the data point closest to ).
iir_7_2_1	Tiered indexes 7.1.2     tiered indexes  champion lists 7.4 6.9  Tiered indexes.If we fail to get results from tier 1, query processing ``falls back'' to tier 2, and so on. Within each tier, postings are ordered by document ID.
iir_7_2_2	Query-term proximity Especially for free text queries on the web (Chapter 19 ), users prefer a document in which most or all of the query terms appear close to each other, because this is evidence that the document has text focused on their query intent. Consider a query with two or more query terms, . Let be the width of the smallest window in a document that contains all the query terms, measured in the number of words in the window. For instance, if the document were to simply consist of the sentence The quality of mercy is not strained, the smallest window for the query strained mercy would be 4. Intuitively, the smaller that is, the better that matches the query. In cases where the document does not contain all of the query terms, we can set to be some enormous number. We could also consider variants in which only words that are not stop words are considered in computing . Such proximity-weighted scoring functions are a departure from pure cosine similarity and closer to the ``soft conjunctive'' semantics that Google and other web search engines evidently use. How can we design such a proximity-weighted scoring function to depend on ? The simplest answer relies on a ``hand coding'' technique we introduce below in Section 7.2.3 . A more scalable approach goes back to Section 6.1.2 - we treat the integer as yet another feature in the scoring function, whose importance is assigned by machine learning, as will be developed further in Section 15.4.1 .
iir_7_2_3	Designing parsing and scoring functions  free text queries The answer of course depends on the user population, the query distribution and the collection of documents. Typically, a query parser is used to translate the user-specified keywords into a query with various operators that is executed against the underlying indexes. Sometimes, this execution can entail multiple queries against the underlying indexes; for example, the query parser may issue a stream of queries: Run the user-generated query string as a phrase query. Rank them by vector space scoring using as query the vector consisting of the 3 terms rising interest rates. If fewer than ten documents contain the phrase rising interest rates, run the two 2-term phrase queries rising interest and interest rates; rank these using vector space scoring, as well. If we still have fewer than ten results, run the vector space query consisting of the three individual query terms.  accumulates evidence The answer depends on the setting. In many enterprise settings we have application builders who make use of a toolkit of available scoring operators, along with a query parsing layer, with which to manually configure the scoring function as well as the query parser. Such application builders make use of the available zones, metadata and knowledge of typical documents and queries to tune the parsing and scoring. In collections whose characteristics change infrequently (in an enterprise application, significant changes in collection and query characteristics typically happen with infrequent events such as the introduction of new document formats or document management systems, or a merger with another company). Web search on the other hand is faced with a constantly changing document collection with new characteristics being introduced all the time. It is also a setting in which the number of scoring factors can run into the hundreds, making hand-tuned scoring a difficult exercise. To address this, it is becoming increasingly common to use machine-learned scoring, extending the ideas we introduced in Section 6.1.2 , as will be discussed further in Section 15.4.1 .
iir_7_2_4	Putting it all together 7.5  A complete search system.Data paths are shown primarily for a free text query. In this figure, documents stream in from the left for parsing and linguistic processing (language and format detection, tokenization and stemming). The resulting stream of tokens feeds into two modules. First, we retain a copy of each parsed document in a document cache. This will enable us to generate results snippets : snippets of text accompanying each document in the results list for a query. This snippet tries to give a succinct explanation to the user of why the document matches the query. The automatic generation of such snippets is the subject of Section 8.7 . A second copy of the tokens is fed to a bank of indexers that create a bank of indexes including zone and field indexes that store the metadata for each document, (tiered) positional indexes, indexes for spelling correction and other tolerant retrieval, and structures for accelerating inexact top- retrieval. A free text user query (top center) is sent down to the indexes both directly and through a module for generating spelling-correction candidates. As noted in Chapter 3 the latter may optionally be invoked only when the original query fails to retrieve enough results. Retrieved documents (dark arrow) are passed to a scoring module that computes scores based on machine-learned ranking (MLR), a technique that builds on Section 6.1.2 (to be further developed in Section 15.4.1 ) for scoring and ranking documents. Finally, these ranked documents are rendered as a results page. Exercises. Explain how the postings intersection algorithm first introduced in Section 1.3 can be adapted to find the smallest integer that contains all query terms. Adapt this procedure to work when not all query terms are present in a document.
iir_7_3	Vector space scoring and query operator interaction Vector space scoring supports so-called free text retrieval, in which a query is specified as a set of words without any query operators connecting them. It allows documents matching the query to be scored and thus ranked, unlike the Boolean, wildcard and phrase queries studied earlier. Classically, the interpretation of such free text queries was that at least one of the query terms be present in any retrieved document. However more recently, web search engines such as Google have popularized the notion that a set of terms typed into their query boxes (thus on the face of it, a free text query) carries the semantics of a conjunctive query that only retrieves documents containing all or most query terms.   Subsections Boolean retrieval Wildcard queries Phrase queries

iir_8	Evaluation in information retrieval We have seen in the preceding chapters many alternatives in designing an IR system. How do we know which of these techniques are effective in which applications? Should we use stop lists? Should we stem? Should we use inverse document frequency weighting? Information retrieval has developed as a highly empirical discipline, requiring careful and thorough evaluation to demonstrate the superior performance of novel techniques on representative document collections. In this chapter we begin with a discussion of measuring the effectiveness of IR systems (Section 8.1 ) and the test collections that are most often used for this purpose (Section 8.2 ). We then present the straightforward notion of relevant and nonrelevant documents and the formal evaluation methodology that has been developed for evaluating unranked retrieval results (Section 8.3 ). This includes explaining the kinds of evaluation measures that are standardly used for document retrieval and related tasks like text classification and why they are appropriate. We then extend these notions and develop further measures for evaluating ranked retrieval results (Section 8.4 ) and discuss developing reliable and informative test collections (Section 8.5 ). We then step back to introduce the notion of user utility, and how it is approximated by the use of document relevance (Section 8.6 ). The key utility measure is user happiness. Speed of response and the size of the index are factors in user happiness. It seems reasonable to assume that relevance of results is the most important factor: blindingly fast, useless answers do not make a user happy. However, user perceptions do not always coincide with system designers' notions of quality. For example, user happiness commonly depends very strongly on user interface design issues, including the layout, clarity, and responsiveness of the user interface, which are independent of the quality of the results returned. We touch on other measures of the quality of a system, in particular the generation of high-quality result summary snippets, which strongly influence user utility, but are not measured in the basic relevance ranking paradigm (Section 8.7 ).

iir_8_1	Information retrieval system evaluation To measure ad hoc information retrieval effectiveness in the standard way, we need a test collection consisting of three things: A document collection A test suite of information needs, expressible as queries A set of relevance judgments, standardly a binary assessment of either relevant or nonrelevant for each query-document pair.  relevant nonrelevant   gold standard  ground truth Relevance is assessed relative to an , not a query. For example, an information need might be: Information on whether drinking red wine is more effective at reducing your risk of heart attacks than white wine. wine and red and white and heart and attack and effective 8.5.1 Many systems contain various weights (often known as parameters) that can be adjusted to tune system performance. It is wrong to report results on a test collection which were obtained by tuning these parameters to maximize performance on that collection. That is because such tuning overstates the expected performance of the system, because the weights will be set to maximize performance on one particular set of queries rather than for a random sample of queries. In such cases, the correct procedure is to have one or more development test collections , and to tune the parameters on the development test collection. The tester then runs the system with those weights on the test collection and reports the results on that collection as an unbiased estimate of performance.
iir_8_2	Standard test collections Here is a list of the most standard test collections and evaluation series. We focus particularly on test collections for ad hoc information retrieval system evaluation, but also mention a couple of similar test collections for text classification. The Cranfield collection. This was the pioneering test collection in allowing precise quantitative measures of information retrieval effectiveness, but is nowadays too small for anything but the most elementary pilot experiments. Collected in the United Kingdom starting in the late 1950s, it contains 1398 abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of 225 queries, and exhaustive relevance judgments of all (query, document) pairs. Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) . The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has run a large IR test bed evaluation series since 1992. Within this framework, there have been many tracks over a range of different test collections, but the best known test collections are the ones used for the TREC Ad Hoc track during the first 8 TREC evaluations between 1992 and 1999. In total, these test collections comprise 6 CDs containing 1.89 million documents (mainly, but not exclusively, newswire articles) and relevance judgments for 450 information needs, which are called topics and specified in detailed text passages. Individual test collections are defined over different subsets of this data. The early TRECs each consisted of 50 information needs, evaluated over different but overlapping sets of documents. TRECs 6-8 provide 150 information needs over about 528,000 newswire and Foreign Broadcast Information Service articles. This is probably the best subcollection to use in future work, because it is the largest and the topics are more consistent. Because the test document collections are so large, there are no exhaustive relevance judgments. Rather, NIST assessors' relevance judgments are available only for the documents that were among the top returned for some system which was entered in the TREC evaluation for which the information need was developed. In more recent years, NIST has done evaluations on larger document collections, including the 25 million page GOV2 web page collection. From the beginning, the NIST test document collections were orders of magnitude larger than anything available to researchers previously and GOV2 is now the largest Web collection easily available for research purposes. Nevertheless, the size of GOV2 is still more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the current size of the document collections indexed by the large web search companies. NII Test Collections for IR Systems ( NTCIR ). The NTCIR project has built various test collections of similar sizes to the TREC collections, focusing on East Asian language and cross-language information retrieval , where queries are made in one language over a document collection containing documents in one or more other languages. See: http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/data/data-en.html Cross Language Evaluation Forum ( CLEF ). This evaluation series has concentrated on European languages and cross-language information retrieval. See: http://www.clef-campaign.org/ and Reuters-RCV1. For text classification, the most used test collection has been the Reuters-21578 collection of 21578 newswire articles; see Chapter 13 , page 13.6 . More recently, Reuters released the much larger Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1), consisting of 806,791 documents; see Chapter 4 , page 4.2 . Its scale and rich annotation makes it a better basis for future research. 20 Newsgroups . This is another widely used text classification collection, collected by Ken Lang. It consists of 1000 articles from each of 20 Usenet newsgroups (the newsgroup name being regarded as the category). After the removal of duplicate articles, as it is usually used, it contains 18941 articles.
iir_8_3	Evaluation of unranked retrieval sets Given these ingredients, how is system effectiveness measured? The two most frequent and basic measures for information retrieval effectiveness are precision and recall. These are first defined for the simple case where an IR system returns a set of documents for a query. We will see later how to extend these notions to ranked retrieval situations. Precision ( ) is the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant (36) Recall ( ) is the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved (37)     (38) (39)   An obvious alternative that may occur to the reader is to judge an information retrieval system by its accuracy , that is, the fraction of its classifications that are correct. In terms of the contingency table above, . This seems plausible, since there are two actual classes, relevant and nonrelevant, and an information retrieval system can be thought of as a two-class classifier which attempts to label them as such (it retrieves the subset of documents which it believes to be relevant). This is precisely the effectiveness measure often used for evaluating machine learning classification problems. There is a good reason why accuracy is not an appropriate measure for information retrieval problems. In almost all circumstances, the data is extremely skewed: normally over 99.9% of the documents are in the nonrelevant category. A system tuned to maximize accuracy can appear to perform well by simply deeming all documents nonrelevant to all queries. Even if the system is quite good, trying to label some documents as relevant will almost always lead to a high rate of false positives. However, labeling all documents as nonrelevant is completely unsatisfying to an information retrieval system user. Users are always going to want to see some documents, and can be assumed to have a certain tolerance for seeing some false positives providing that they get some useful information. The measures of precision and recall concentrate the evaluation on the return of true positives, asking what percentage of the relevant documents have been found and how many false positives have also been returned. The advantage of having the two numbers for precision and recall is that one is more important than the other in many circumstances. Typical web surfers would like every result on the first page to be relevant (high precision) but have not the slightest interest in knowing let alone looking at every document that is relevant. In contrast, various professional searchers such as paralegals and intelligence analysts are very concerned with trying to get as high recall as possible, and will tolerate fairly low precision results in order to get it. Individuals searching their hard disks are also often interested in high recall searches. Nevertheless, the two quantities clearly trade off against one another: you can always get a recall of 1 (but very low precision) by retrieving all documents for all queries! Recall is a non-decreasing function of the number of documents retrieved. On the other hand, in a good system, precision usually decreases as the number of documents retrieved is increased. In general we want to get some amount of recall while tolerating only a certain percentage of false positives. A single measure that trades off precision versus recall is the F measure , which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall: (40)     balanced F measure        (41)       Graph comparing the harmonic mean to other means.The graph shows a slice through the calculation of various means of precision and recall for the fixed recall value of 70%. The harmonic mean is always less than either the arithmetic or geometric mean, and often quite close to the minimum of the two numbers. When the precision is also 70%, all the measures coincide. Why do we use a harmonic mean rather than the simpler average (arithmetic mean)? Recall that we can always get 100% recall by just returning all documents, and therefore we can always get a 50% arithmetic mean by the same process. This strongly suggests that the arithmetic mean is an unsuitable measure to use. In contrast, if we assume that 1 document in 10,000 is relevant to the query, the harmonic mean score of this strategy is 0.02%. The harmonic mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean. When the values of two numbers differ greatly, the harmonic mean is closer to their minimum than to their arithmetic mean; see Figure 8.1 . Exercises. An IR system returns 8 relevant documents, and 10 nonrelevant documents. There are a total of 20 relevant documents in the collection. What is the precision of the system on this search, and what is its recall? The balanced F measure (a.k.a. F) is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. What is the advantage of using the harmonic mean rather than ``averaging'' (using the arithmetic mean)? Derive the equivalence between the two formulas for F measure shown in Equation 40, given that .
iir_8_4	Evaluation of ranked retrieval results  Figure 8.2: Precision/recall graph. Precision, recall, and the F measure are set-based measures. They are computed using unordered sets of documents. We need to extend these measures (or to define new measures) if we are to evaluate the ranked retrieval results that are now standard with search engines. In a ranked retrieval context, appropriate sets of retrieved documents are naturally given by the top retrieved documents. For each such set, precision and recall values can be plotted to give a precision-recall curve , such as the one shown in Figure 8.2 . Precision-recall curves have a distinctive saw-tooth shape: if the document retrieved is nonrelevant then recall is the same as for the top documents, but precision has dropped. If it is relevant, then both precision and recall increase, and the curve jags up and to the right. It is often useful to remove these jiggles and the standard way to do this is with an interpolated precision: the interpolated precision at a certain recall level is defined as the highest precision found for any recall level : (42)  The justification is that almost anyone would be prepared to look at a few more documents if it would increase the percentage of the viewed set that were relevant (that is, if the precision of the larger set is higher). Interpolated precision is shown by a thinner line in Figure 8.2 . With this definition, the interpolated precision at a recall of 0 is well-defined (Exercise 8.4 ).   Recall Interp.   Precision 0.0 1.00 0.1 0.67 0.2 0.63 0.3 0.55 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.41 0.6 0.36 0.7 0.29 0.8 0.13 0.9 0.10 1.0 0.08 Calculation of 11-point Interpolated Average Precision.This is for the precision-recall curve shown in Figure 8.2 .  Examining the entire precision-recall curve is very informative, but there is often a desire to boil this information down to a few numbers, or perhaps even a single number. The traditional way of doing this (used for instance in the first 8 TREC Ad Hoc evaluations) is the 11-point interpolated average precision . For each information need, the interpolated precision is measured at the 11 recall levels of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0. For the precision-recall curve in Figure 8.2 , these 11 values are shown in Table 8.1 . For each recall level, we then calculate the arithmetic mean of the interpolated precision at that recall level for each information need in the test collection. A composite precision-recall curve showing 11 points can then be graphed. Figure 8.3 shows an example graph of such results from a representative good system at TREC 8.  Averaged 11-point precision/recall graph across 50 queries for a representative TREC system.The Mean Average Precision for this system is 0.2553. In recent years, other measures have become more common. Most standard among the TREC community is Mean Average Precision (MAP), which provides a single-figure measure of quality across recall levels. Among evaluation measures, MAP has been shown to have especially good discrimination and stability. For a single information need, Average Precision is the average of the precision value obtained for the set of top documents existing after each relevant document is retrieved, and this value is then averaged over information needs. That is, if the set of relevant documents for an information need is and is the set of ranked retrieval results from the top result until you get to document , then (43)   Using MAP, fixed recall levels are not chosen, and there is no interpolation. The MAP value for a test collection is the arithmetic mean of average precision values for individual information needs. (This has the effect of weighting each information need equally in the final reported number, even if many documents are relevant to some queries whereas very few are relevant to other queries.) Calculated MAP scores normally vary widely across information needs when measured within a single system, for instance, between 0.1 and 0.7. Indeed, there is normally more agreement in MAP for an individual information need across systems than for MAP scores for different information needs for the same system. This means that a set of test information needs must be large and diverse enough to be representative of system effectiveness across different queries. The above measures factor in precision at all recall levels. For many prominent applications, particularly web search, this may not be germane to users. What matters is rather how many good results there are on the first page or the first three pages. This leads to measuring precision at fixed low levels of retrieved results, such as 10 or 30 documents. This is referred to as ``Precision at '', for example ``Precision at 10''. It has the advantage of not requiring any estimate of the size of the set of relevant documents but the disadvantages that it is the least stable of the commonly used evaluation measures and that it does not average well, since the total number of relevant documents for a query has a strong influence on precision at . An alternative, which alleviates this problem, is R-precision . It requires having a set of known relevant documents , from which we calculate the precision of the top documents returned. (The set may be incomplete, such as when is formed by creating relevance judgments for the pooled top results of particular systems in a set of experiments.) R-precision adjusts for the size of the set of relevant documents: A perfect system could score 1 on this metric for each query, whereas, even a perfect system could only achieve a precision at 20 of 0.4 if there were only 8 documents in the collection relevant to an information need. Averaging this measure across queries thus makes more sense. This measure is harder to explain to naive users than Precision at but easier to explain than MAP. If there are relevant documents for a query, we examine the top results of a system, and find that are relevant, then by definition, not only is the precision (and hence R-precision) , but the recall of this result set is also . Thus, R-precision turns out to be identical to the break-even point , another measure which is sometimes used, defined in terms of this equality relationship holding. Like Precision at , R-precision describes only one point on the precision-recall curve, rather than attempting to summarize effectiveness across the curve, and it is somewhat unclear why you should be interested in the break-even point rather than either the best point on the curve (the point with maximal F-measure) or a retrieval level of interest to a particular application (Precision at ). Nevertheless, R-precision turns out to be highly correlated with MAP empirically, despite measuring only a single point on the curve.  Figure 8.4: The ROC curve corresponding to the precision-recall curve in Figure 8.2 . . Another concept sometimes used in evaluation is an ROC curve . (``ROC'' stands for ``Receiver Operating Characteristics'', but knowing that doesn't help most people.) An ROC curve plots the true positive rate or sensitivity against the false positive rate or ( ). Here, sensitivity is just another term for recall. The false positive rate is given by . Figure 8.4 shows the ROC curve corresponding to the precision-recall curve in Figure 8.2 . An ROC curve always goes from the bottom left to the top right of the graph. For a good system, the graph climbs steeply on the left side. For unranked result sets, specificity , given by , was not seen as a very useful notion. Because the set of true negatives is always so large, its value would be almost 1 for all information needs (and, correspondingly, the value of the false positive rate would be almost 0). That is, the ``interesting'' part of Figure 8.2 is , a part which is compressed to a small corner of Figure 8.4 . But an ROC curve could make sense when looking over the full retrieval spectrum, and it provides another way of looking at the data. In many fields, a common aggregate measure is to report the area under the ROC curve, which is the ROC analog of MAP. Precision-recall curves are sometimes loosely referred to as ROC curves. This is understandable, but not accurate. A final approach that has seen increasing adoption, especially when employed with machine learning approaches to ranking svm-ranking is measures of cumulative gain , and in particular normalized discounted cumulative gain ( NDCG ). NDCG is designed for situations of non-binary notions of relevance (cf. Section 8.5.1 ). Like precision at , it is evaluated over some number of top search results. For a set of queries , let be the relevance score assessors gave to document for query . Then, (44)       Exercises. What are the possible values for interpolated precision at a recall level of 0? Must there always be a break-even point between precision and recall? Either show there must be or give a counter-example. What is the relationship between the value of and the break-even point? The Dice coefficient of two sets is a measure of their intersection scaled by their size (giving a value in the range 0 to 1): (45) Show that the balanced F-measure () is equal to the Dice coefficient of the retrieved and relevant document sets. Consider an information need for which there are 4 relevant documents in the collection. Contrast two systems run on this collection.

Which has a higher MAP? Does this result intuitively make sense? What does it say about what is important in getting a good MAP score? What is the R-precision of each system?

The following list of Rs and Ns represents relevant (R) and nonrelevant (N) returned documents in a ranked list of 20 documents retrieved in response to a query from a collection of 10,000 documents.

What is the largest possible MAP that this system could have? g. What is the smallest possible MAP that this system could have? h. In a set of experiments, only the top 20 results are evaluated by hand. The result in (e) is used to approximate the range (f)-(g). For this example, how large (in absolute terms) can the error for the MAP be by calculating (e) instead of (f) and (g) for this query?
iir_8_5	Assessing relevance To properly evaluate a system, your test information needs must be germane to the documents in the test document collection, and appropriate for predicted usage of the system. These information needs are best designed by domain experts. Using random combinations of query terms as an information need is generally not a good idea because typically they will not resemble the actual distribution of information needs. Given information needs and documents, you need to collect relevance assessments. This is a time-consuming and expensive process involving human beings. For tiny collections like Cranfield, exhaustive judgments of relevance for each query and document pair were obtained. For large modern collections, it is usual for relevance to be assessed only for a subset of the documents for each query. The most standard approach is pooling , where relevance is assessed over a subset of the collection that is formed from the top documents returned by a number of different IR systems (usually the ones to be evaluated), and perhaps other sources such as the results of Boolean keyword searches or documents found by expert searchers in an interactive process.   Table 8.2: Calculating the kappa statistic.     Judge 2 Relevance     Yes   No Total Judge 1 Yes 300   20 320 Relevance No 10   70 80   Total 310   90 400 Observed proportion of the times the judges agreed Pooled marginals Probability that the two judges agreed by chance Kappa statistic   A human is not a device that reliably reports a gold standard judgment of relevance of a document to a query. Rather, humans and their relevance judgments are quite idiosyncratic and variable. But this is not a problem to be solved: in the final analysis, the success of an IR system depends on how good it is at satisfying the needs of these idiosyncratic humans, one information need at a time. Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider and measure how much agreement between judges there is on relevance judgments. In the social sciences, a common measure for agreement between judges is the kappa statistic . It is designed for categorical judgments and corrects a simple agreement rate for the rate of chance agreement. (46)      marginal  8.2 Interjudge agreement of relevance has been measured within the TREC evaluations and for medical IR collections. Using the above rules of thumb, the level of agreement normally falls in the range of ``fair'' (0.67-0.8). The fact that human agreement on a binary relevance judgment is quite modest is one reason for not requiring more fine-grained relevance labeling from the test set creator. To answer the question of whether IR evaluation results are valid despite the variation of individual assessors' judgments, people have experimented with evaluations taking one or the other of two judges' opinions as the gold standard. The choice can make a considerable absolute difference to reported scores, but has in general been found to have little impact on the relative effectiveness ranking of either different systems or variants of a single system which are being compared for effectiveness.   Subsections Critiques and justifications of the concept of relevance
iir_8_5_1	Critiques and justifications of the concept of relevance The advantage of system evaluation, as enabled by the standard model of relevant and nonrelevant documents, is that we have a fixed setting in which we can vary IR systems and system parameters to carry out comparative experiments. Such formal testing is much less expensive and allows clearer diagnosis of the effect of changing system parameters than doing user studies of retrieval effectiveness. Indeed, once we have a formal measure that we have confidence in, we can proceed to optimize effectiveness by machine learning methods, rather than tuning parameters by hand. Of course, if the formal measure poorly describes what users actually want, doing this will not be effective in improving user satisfaction. Our perspective is that, in practice, the standard formal measures for IR evaluation, although a simplification, are good enough, and recent work in optimizing formal evaluation measures in IR has succeeded brilliantly. There are numerous examples of techniques developed in formal evaluation settings, which improve effectiveness in operational settings, such as the development of document length normalization methods within the context of TREC ( and 11.4.3 ) and machine learning methods for adjusting parameter weights in scoring (Section 6.1.2 ). That is not to say that there are not problems latent within the abstractions used. The relevance of one document is treated as independent of the relevance of other documents in the collection. (This assumption is actually built into most retrieval systems - documents are scored against queries, not against each other - as well as being assumed in the evaluation methods.) Assessments are binary: there aren't any nuanced assessments of relevance. Relevance of a document to an information need is treated as an absolute, objective decision. But judgments of relevance are subjective, varying across people, as we discussed above. In practice, human assessors are also imperfect measuring instruments, susceptible to failures of understanding and attention. We also have to assume that users' information needs do not change as they start looking at retrieval results. Any results based on one collection are heavily skewed by the choice of collection, queries, and relevance judgment set: the results may not translate from one domain to another or to a different user population. Some of these problems may be fixable. A number of recent evaluations, including INEX, some TREC tracks, and NTCIR have adopted an ordinal notion of relevance with documents divided into 3 or 4 classes, distinguishing slightly relevant documents from highly relevant documents. See Section 10.4 (page ) for a detailed discussion of how this is implemented in the INEX evaluations. One clear problem with the relevance-based assessment that we have presented is the distinction between relevance and marginal relevance : whether a document still has distinctive usefulness after the user has looked at certain other documents (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). Even if a document is highly relevant, its information can be completely redundant with other documents which have already been examined. The most extreme case of this is documents that are duplicates - a phenomenon that is actually very common on the World Wide Web - but it can also easily occur when several documents provide a similar precis of an event. In such circumstances, marginal relevance is clearly a better measure of utility to the user. Maximizing marginal relevance requires returning documents that exhibit diversity and novelty. One way to approach measuring this is by using distinct facts or entities as evaluation units. This perhaps more directly measures true utility to the user but doing this makes it harder to create a test collection. Exercises. Below is a table showing how two human judges rated the relevance of a set of 12 documents to a particular information need (0 = nonrelevant, 1 = relevant). Let us assume that you've written an IR system that for this query returns the set of documents {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. docID Judge 1 Judge 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 1 1 4 1 1 5 1 0 6 1 0 7 1 0 8 1 0 9 0 1 10 0 1 11 0 1 12 0 1 Calculate the kappa measure between the two judges. Calculate precision, recall, and of your system if a document is considered relevant only if the two judges agree. Calculate precision, recall, and of your system if a document is considered relevant if either judge thinks it is relevant.
iir_8_6	A broader perspective: System quality and user utility Formal evaluation measures are at some distance from our ultimate interest in measures of human utility: how satisfied is each user with the results the system gives for each information need that they pose? The standard way to measure human satisfaction is by various kinds of user studies. These might include quantitative measures, both objective, such as time to complete a task, as well as subjective, such as a score for satisfaction with the search engine, and qualitative measures, such as user comments on the search interface. In this section we will touch on other system aspects that allow quantitative evaluation and the issue of user utility.   Subsections System issues User utility Refining a deployed system
iir_8_6_1	System issues There are many practical benchmarks on which to rate an information retrieval system beyond its retrieval quality. These include: How fast does it index, that is, how many documents per hour does it index for a certain distribution over document lengths? (cf. Chapter 4 ) How fast does it search, that is, what is its latency as a function of index size? How expressive is its query language? How fast is it on complex queries? How large is its document collection, in terms of the number of documents or the collection having information distributed across a broad range of topics? measurable
iir_8_6_2	User utility What we would really like is a way of quantifying aggregate user happiness, based on the relevance, speed, and user interface of a system. One part of this is understanding the distribution of people we wish to make happy, and this depends entirely on the setting. For a web search engine, happy search users are those who find what they want. One indirect measure of such users is that they tend to return to the same engine. Measuring the rate of return of users is thus an effective metric, which would of course be more effective if you could also measure how much these users used other search engines. But advertisers are also users of modern web search engines. They are happy if customers click through to their sites and then make purchases. On an eCommerce web site, a user is likely to be wanting to purchase something. Thus, we can measure the time to purchase, or the fraction of searchers who become buyers. On a shopfront web site, perhaps both the user's and the store owner's needs are satisfied if a purchase is made. Nevertheless, in general, we need to decide whether it is the end user's or the eCommerce site owner's happiness that we are trying to optimize. Usually, it is the store owner who is paying us. For an ``enterprise'' (company, government, or academic) intranet search engine, the relevant metric is more likely to be user productivity: how much time do users spend looking for information that they need. There are also many other practical criteria concerning such matters as information security, which we mentioned in Section 4.6 (page ). User happiness is elusive to measure, and this is part of why the standard methodology uses the proxy of relevance of search results. The standard direct way to get at user satisfaction is to run user studies, where people engage in tasks, and usually various metrics are measured, the participants are observed, and ethnographic interview techniques are used to get qualitative information on satisfaction. User studies are very useful in system design, but they are time consuming and expensive to do. They are also difficult to do well, and expertise is required to design the studies and to interpret the results. We will not discuss the details of human usability testing here.
iir_8_6_3	Refining a deployed system If an IR system has been built and is being used by a large number of users, the system's builders can evaluate possible changes by deploying variant versions of the system and recording measures that are indicative of user satisfaction with one variant vs. others as they are being used. This method is frequently used by web search engines. The most common version of this is A/B testing , a term borrowed from the advertising industry. For such a test, precisely one thing is changed between the current system and a proposed system, and a small proportion of traffic (say, 1-10% of users) is randomly directed to the variant system, while most users use the current system. For example, if we wish to investigate a change to the ranking algorithm, we redirect a random sample of users to a variant system and evaluate measures such as the frequency with which people click on the top result, or any result on the first page. (This particular analysis method is referred to as clickthrough log analysis or clickstream mining . It is further discussed as a method of implicit feedback in Section 9.1.7 (page ).) The basis of A/B testing is running a bunch of single variable tests (either in sequence or in parallel): for each test only one parameter is varied from the control (the current live system). It is therefore easy to see whether varying each parameter has a positive or negative effect. Such testing of a live system can easily and cheaply gauge the effect of a change on users, and, with a large enough user base, it is practical to measure even very small positive and negative effects. In principle, more analytic power can be achieved by varying multiple things at once in an uncorrelated (random) way, and doing standard multivariate statistical analysis, such as multiple linear regression. In practice, though, A/B testing is widely used, because A/B tests are easy to deploy, easy to understand, and easy to explain to management.
iir_8_7	Results snippets Having chosen or ranked the documents matching a query, we wish to present a results list that will be informative to the user. In many cases the user will not want to examine all the returned documents and so we want to make the results list informative enough that the user can do a final ranking of the documents for themselves based on relevance to their information need.The standard way of doing this is to provide a snippet , a short summary of the document, which is designed so as to allow the user to decide its relevance. Typically, the snippet consists of the document title and a short summary, which is automatically extracted. The question is how to design the summary so as to maximize its usefulness to the user. The two basic kinds of summaries are static , which are always the same regardless of the query, and dynamic (or query-dependent), which are customized according to the user's information need as deduced from a query. Dynamic summaries attempt to explain why a particular document was retrieved for the query at hand. A static summary is generally comprised of either or both a subset of the document and metadata associated with the document. The simplest form of summary takes the first two sentences or 50 words of a document, or extracts particular zones of a document, such as the title and author. Instead of zones of a document, the summary can instead use metadata associated with the document. This may be an alternative way to provide an author or date, or may include elements which are designed to give a summary, such as the description metadata which can appear in the meta element of a web HTML page. This summary is typically extracted and cached at indexing time, in such a way that it can be retrieved and presented quickly when displaying search results, whereas having to access the actual document content might be a relatively expensive operation. There has been extensive work within natural language processing (NLP) on better ways to do text summarization . Most such work still aims only to choose sentences from the original document to present and concentrates on how to select good sentences. The models typically combine positional factors, favoring the first and last paragraphs of documents and the first and last sentences of paragraphs, with content factors, emphasizing sentences with key terms, which have low document frequency in the collection as a whole, but high frequency and good distribution across the particular document being returned. In sophisticated NLP approaches, the system synthesizes sentences for a summary, either by doing full text generation or by editing and perhaps combining sentences used in the document. For example, it might delete a relative clause or replace a pronoun with the noun phrase that it refers to. This last class of methods remains in the realm of research and is seldom used for search results: it is easier, safer, and often even better to just use sentences from the original document. Dynamic summaries display one or more ``windows'' on the document, aiming to present the pieces that have the most utility to the user in evaluating the document with respect to their information need. Usually these windows contain one or several of the query terms, and so are often referred to as keyword-in-context ( ) snippets, though sometimes they may still be pieces of the text such as the title that are selected for their query-independent information value just as in the case of static summarization. Dynamic summaries are generated in conjunction with scoring. If the query is found as a phrase, occurrences of the phrase in the document will be shown as the summary. If not, windows within the document that contain multiple query terms will be selected. Commonly these windows may just stretch some number of words to the left and right of the query terms. This is a place where NLP techniques can usefully be employed: users prefer snippets that read well because they contain complete phrases.   Dynamic summaries are generally regarded as greatly improving the usability of IR systems, but they present a complication for IR system design. A dynamic summary cannot be precomputed, but, on the other hand, if a system has only a positional index, then it cannot easily reconstruct the context surrounding search engine hits in order to generate such a dynamic summary. This is one reason for using static summaries. The standard solution to this in a world of large and cheap disk drives is to locally cache all the documents at index time (notwithstanding that this approach raises various legal, information security and control issues that are far from resolved) as shown in Figure 7.5 (page ). Then, a system can simply scan a document which is about to appear in a displayed results list to find snippets containing the query words. Beyond simply access to the text, producing a good KWIC snippet requires some care. Given a variety of keyword occurrences in a document, the goal is to choose fragments which are: (i) maximally informative about the discussion of those terms in the document, (ii) self-contained enough to be easy to read, and (iii) short enough to fit within the normally strict constraints on the space available for summaries. Generating snippets must be fast since the system is typically generating many snippets for each query that it handles. Rather than caching an entire document, it is common to cache only a generous but fixed size prefix of the document, such as perhaps 10,000 characters. For most common, short documents, the entire document is thus cached, but huge amounts of local storage will not be wasted on potentially vast documents. Summaries of documents whose length exceeds the prefix size will be based on material in the prefix only, which is in general a useful zone in which to look for a document summary anyway. If a document has been updated since it was last processed by a crawler and indexer, these changes will be neither in the cache nor in the index. In these circumstances, neither the index nor the summary will accurately reflect the current contents of the document, but it is the differences between the summary and the actual document content that will be more glaringly obvious to the end user.
iir_8_8	References and further reading Definition and implementation of the notion of relevance to a query got off to a rocky start in 1953. Swanson (1988) reports that in an evaluation in that year between two teams, they agreed that 1390 documents were variously relevant to a set of 98 questions, but disagreed on a further 1577 documents, and the disagreements were never resolved. Rigorous formal testing of IR systems was first completed in the Cranfield experiments, beginning in the late 1950s. A retrospective discussion of the Cranfield test collection and experimentation with it can be found in (Cleverdon, 1991). The other seminal series of early IR experiments were those on the SMART system by Gerard Salton and colleagues (Salton, 1971b;1991). The TREC evaluations are described in detail by Voorhees and Harman (2005). Online information is available at http://trec.nist.gov/. Initially, few researchers computed the statistical significance of their experimental results, but the IR community increasingly demands this (Hull, 1993). User studies of IR system effectiveness began more recently (Saracevic and Kantor, 1988;1996). The notions of recall and precision were first used by Kent et al. (1955), although the term precision did not appear until later. The (or, rather its complement ) was introduced by van Rijsbergen (1979). He provides an extensive theoretical discussion, which shows how adopting a principle of decreasing marginal relevance (at some point a user will be unwilling to sacrifice a unit of precision for an added unit of recall) leads to the harmonic mean being the appropriate method for combining precision and recall (and hence to its adoption rather than the minimum or geometric mean). Buckley and Voorhees (2000) compare several evaluation measures, including precision at , MAP, and R-precision, and evaluate the error rate of each measure. was adopted as the official evaluation metric in the TREC HARD track (Allan, 2005). Aslam and Yilmaz (2005) examine its surprisingly close correlation to MAP, which had been noted in earlier studies (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000, Tague-Sutcliffe and Blustein, 1995). A standard program for evaluating IR systems which computes many measures of ranked retrieval effectiveness is Chris Buckley's trec_eval program used in the TREC evaluations. It can be downloaded from: http://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/. Kekäläinen and Järvelin (2002) argue for the superiority of graded relevance judgments when dealing with very large document collections, and Järvelin and Kekäläinen (2002) introduce cumulated gain-based methods for IR system evaluation in this context. Sakai (2007) does a study of the stability and sensitivity of evaluation measures based on graded relevance judgments from NTCIR tasks, and concludes that NDCG is best for evaluating document ranking. Schamber et al. (1990) examine the concept of relevance, stressing its multidimensional and context-specific nature, but also arguing that it can be measured effectively. (Voorhees, 2000) is the standard article for examining variation in relevance judgments and their effects on retrieval system scores and ranking for the TREC Ad Hoc task. Voorhees concludes that although the numbers change, the rankings are quite stable. Hersh et al. (1994) present similar analysis for a medical IR collection. In contrast, Kekäläinen (2005) analyze some of the later TRECs, exploring a 4-way relevance judgment and the notion of cumulative gain, arguing that the relevance measure used does substantially affect system rankings. See also Harter (1998). Zobel (1998) studies whether the pooling method used by TREC to collect a subset of documents that will be evaluated for relevance is reliable and fair, and concludes that it is. The and its use for language-related purposes is discussed by Carletta (1996). Many standard sources (e.g., Siegel and Castellan, 1988) present pooled calculation of the expected agreement, but Di Eugenio (2004) argue for preferring the unpooled agreement (though perhaps presenting multiple measures). For further discussion of alternative measures of agreement, which may in fact be better, see Lombard et al. (2002) and Krippendorff (2003). Text summarization has been actively explored for many years. Modern work on sentence selection was initiated by Kupiec et al. (1995). More recent work includes (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) and (Jing, 2000), together with a broad selection of work appearing at the yearly DUC conferences and at other NLP venues. Tombros and Sanderson (1998) demonstrate the advantages of dynamic summaries in the IR context. Turpin et al. (2007) address how to generate snippets efficiently. Clickthrough log analysis is studied in (Joachims, 2002b, Joachims et al., 2005). In a series of papers, Hersh, Turpin and colleagues show how improvements in formal retrieval effectiveness, as evaluated in batch experiments, do not always translate into an improved system for users (Hersh et al., 2000b, Turpin and Hersh, 2002, Hersh et al., 2000a;2001, Turpin and Hersh, 2001). User interfaces for IR and human factors such as models of human information seeking and usability testing are outside the scope of what we cover in this book. More information on these topics can be found in other textbooks, including (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999, ch. 10) and (Korfhage, 1997), and collections focused on cognitive aspects (Spink and Cole, 2005).
iir_9	Relevance feedback and query expansion In most collections, the same concept may be referred to using different words. This issue, known as synonymy , has an impact on the recall of most information retrieval systems. For example, you would want a search for aircraft to match plane (but only for references to an airplane, not a woodworking plane), and for a search on thermodynamics to match references to heat in appropriate discussions. Users often attempt to address this problem themselves by manually refining a query, as was discussed in Section 1.4 ; in this chapter we discuss ways in which a system can help with query refinement, either fully automatically or with the user in the loop. The methods for tackling this problem split into two major classes: global methods and local methods. Global methods are techniques for expanding or reformulating query terms independent of the query and results returned from it, so that changes in the query wording will cause the new query to match other semantically similar terms. Global methods include: Query expansion/reformulation with a thesaurus or WordNet (Section 9.2.2 ) Query expansion via automatic thesaurus generation (Section 9.2.3 ) Techniques like spelling correction (discussed in Chapter 3 ) Relevance feedback (Section 9.1 ) Pseudo relevance feedback, also known as Blind relevance feedback (Section 9.1.6 ) (Global) indirect relevance feedback (Section 9.1.7 )   Subsections Relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback The Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback The underlying theory.

iir_9_1	Relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback The idea of relevance feedback ( ) is to involve the user in the retrieval process so as to improve the final result set. In particular, the user gives feedback on the relevance of documents in an initial set of results. The basic procedure is: The user issues a (short, simple) query. The system returns an initial set of retrieval results. The user marks some returned documents as relevant or nonrelevant. The system computes a better representation of the information need based on the user feedback. The system displays a revised set of retrieval results.  (a) (b) Relevance feedback searching over images.(a) The user views the initial query results for a query of bike, selects the first, third and fourth result in the top row and the fourth result in the bottom row as relevant, and submits this feedback. (b) The users sees the revised result set. Precision is greatly improved. From http://nayana.ece.ucsb.edu/imsearch/imsearch.html(Newsam et al., 2001). Image search provides a good example of relevance feedback. Not only is it easy to see the results at work, but this is a domain where a user can easily have difficulty formulating what they want in words, but can easily indicate relevant or nonrelevant images. After the user enters an initial query for bike on the demonstration system at: http://nayana.ece.ucsb.edu/imsearch/imsearch.html 9.1 9.1 Figure 9.2 shows a textual IR example where the user wishes to find out about new applications of space satellites.

iir_9_1_1	The Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback The Rocchio Algorithm is the classic algorithm for implementing relevance feedback. It models a way of incorporating relevance feedback information into the vector space model of Section 6.3 .  Figure 9.3: The Rocchio optimal query for separating relevant and nonrelevant documents.   Subsections The underlying theory. The Rocchio (1971) algorithm.
iir_9_1_2	Probabilistic relevance feedback Rather than reweighting the query in a vector space, if a user has told us some relevant and nonrelevant documents, then we can proceed to build a . One way of doing this is with a Naive Bayes probabilistic model. If is a Boolean indicator variable expressing the relevance of a document, then we can estimate , the probability of a term appearing in a document, depending on whether it is relevant or not, as: (50) (51)         11 13 11.3.4  50
iir_9_1_3	When does relevance feedback work? The success of relevance feedback depends on certain assumptions. Firstly, the user has to have sufficient knowledge to be able to make an initial query which is at least somewhere close to the documents they desire. This is needed anyhow for successful information retrieval in the basic case, but it is important to see the kinds of problems that relevance feedback cannot solve alone. Cases where relevance feedback alone is not sufficient include: Misspellings. If the user spells a term in a different way to the way it is spelled in any document in the collection, then relevance feedback is unlikely to be effective. This can be addressed by the spelling correction techniques of Chapter 3 . Cross-language information retrieval. Documents in another language are not nearby in a vector space based on term distribution. Rather, documents in the same language cluster more closely together. Mismatch of searcher's vocabulary versus collection vocabulary. If the user searches for laptop but all the documents use the term notebook computer, then the query will fail, and relevance feedback is again most likely ineffective.  Secondly, the relevance feedback approach requires relevant documents to be similar to each other. That is, they should cluster. Ideally, the term distribution in all relevant documents will be similar to that in the documents marked by the users, while the term distribution in all nonrelevant documents will be different from those in relevant documents. Things will work well if all relevant documents are tightly clustered around a single prototype, or, at least, if there are different prototypes, if the relevant documents have significant vocabulary overlap, while similarities between relevant and nonrelevant documents are small. Implicitly, the Rocchio relevance feedback model treats relevant documents as a single cluster, which it models via the centroid of the cluster. This approach does not work as well if the relevant documents are a multimodal class, that is, they consist of several clusters of documents within the vector space. This can happen with: Subsets of the documents using different vocabulary, such as Burma vs. Myanmar A query for which the answer set is inherently disjunctive, such as Pop stars who once worked at Burger King. Instances of a general concept, which often appear as a disjunction of more specific concepts, for example, felines. Relevance feedback is not necessarily popular with users. Users are often reluctant to provide explicit feedback, or in general do not wish to prolong the search interaction. Furthermore, it is often harder to understand why a particular document was retrieved after relevance feedback is applied. Relevance feedback can also have practical problems. The long queries that are generated by straightforward application of relevance feedback techniques are inefficient for a typical IR system. This results in a high computing cost for the retrieval and potentially long response times for the user. A partial solution to this is to only reweight certain prominent terms in the relevant documents, such as perhaps the top 20 terms by term frequency. Some experimental results have also suggested that using a limited number of terms like this may give better results (Harman, 1992) though other work has suggested that using more terms is better in terms of retrieved document quality (Buckley et al., 1994b).
iir_9_1_4	Relevance feedback on the web Some web search engines offer a similar/related pages feature: the user indicates a document in the results set as exemplary from the standpoint of meeting his information need and requests more documents like it. This can be viewed as a particular simple form of relevance feedback. However, in general relevance feedback has been little used in web search. One exception was the Excite web search engine, which initially provided full relevance feedback. However, the feature was in time dropped, due to lack of use. On the web, few people use advanced search interfaces and most would like to complete their search in a single interaction. But the lack of uptake also probably reflects two other factors: relevance feedback is hard to explain to the average user, and relevance feedback is mainly a recall enhancing strategy, and web search users are only rarely concerned with getting sufficient recall. Spink et al. (2000) present results from the use of relevance feedback in the Excite search engine. Only about 4% of user query sessions used the relevance feedback option, and these were usually exploiting the ``More like this'' link next to each result. About 70% of users only looked at the first page of results and did not pursue things any further. For people who used relevance feedback, results were improved about two thirds of the time. An important more recent thread of work is the use of clickstream data (what links a user clicks on) to provide indirect relevance feedback. Use of this data is studied in detail in (Joachims, 2002b, Joachims et al., 2005). The very successful use of web link structure (see Chapter 21 ) can also be viewed as implicit feedback, but provided by page authors rather than readers (though in practice most authors are also readers). Exercises. In Rocchio's algorithm, what weight setting for does a ``Find pages like this one'' search correspond to? Give three reasons why relevance feedback has been little used in web search.
iir_9_1_5	Evaluation of relevance feedback strategies Interactive relevance feedback can give very substantial gains in retrieval performance. Empirically, one round of relevance feedback is often very useful. Two rounds is sometimes marginally more useful. Successful use of relevance feedback requires enough judged documents, otherwise the process is unstable in that it may drift away from the user's information need. Accordingly, having at least five judged documents is recommended. There is some subtlety to evaluating the effectiveness of relevance feedback in a sound and enlightening way. The obvious first strategy is to start with an initial query and to compute a precision-recall graph. Following one round of feedback from the user, we compute the modified query and again compute a precision-recall graph. Here, in both rounds we assess performance over all documents in the collection, which makes comparisons straightforward. If we do this, we find spectacular gains from relevance feedback: gains on the order of 50% in mean average precision. But unfortunately it is cheating. The gains are partly due to the fact that known relevant documents (judged by the user) are now ranked higher. Fairness demands that we should only evaluate with respect to documents not seen by the user. A second idea is to use documents in the residual collection (the set of documents minus those assessed relevant) for the second round of evaluation. This seems like a more realistic evaluation. Unfortunately, the measured performance can then often be lower than for the original query. This is particularly the case if there are few relevant documents, and so a fair proportion of them have been judged by the user in the first round. The relative performance of variant relevance feedback methods can be validly compared, but it is difficult to validly compare performance with and without relevance feedback because the collection size and the number of relevant documents changes from before the feedback to after it. Thus neither of these methods is fully satisfactory. A third method is to have two collections, one which is used for the initial query and relevance judgments, and the second that is then used for comparative evaluation. The performance of both and can be validly compared on the second collection. Perhaps the best evaluation of the utility of relevance feedback is to do user studies of its effectiveness, in particular by doing a time-based comparison: how fast does a user find relevant documents with relevance feedback vs. another strategy (such as query reformulation), or alternatively, how many relevant documents does a user find in a certain amount of time. Such notions of user utility are fairest and closest to real system usage.
iir_9_1_6	Pseudo relevance feedback Pseudo relevance feedback , also known as blind relevance feedback , provides a method for automatic local analysis. It automates the manual part of relevance feedback, so that the user gets improved retrieval performance without an extended interaction. The method is to do normal retrieval to find an initial set of most relevant documents, to then assume that the top ranked documents are relevant, and finally to do relevance feedback as before under this assumption.   This automatic technique mostly works. Evidence suggests that it tends to work better than global analysis (Section 9.2 ). It has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task. See for example the results in Figure 9.5 . But it is not without the dangers of an automatic process. For example, if the query is about copper mines and the top several documents are all about mines in Chile, then there may be query drift in the direction of documents on Chile.
iir_9_1_7	Indirect relevance feedback We can also use indirect sources of evidence rather than explicit feedback on relevance as the basis for relevance feedback. This is often called implicit (relevance) feedback . Implicit feedback is less reliable than explicit feedback, but is more useful than pseudo relevance feedback, which contains no evidence of user judgments. Moreover, while users are often reluctant to provide explicit feedback, it is easy to collect implicit feedback in large quantities for a high volume system, such as a web search engine. On the web, DirectHit introduced the idea of ranking more highly documents that users chose to look at more often. In other words, clicks on links were assumed to indicate that the page was likely relevant to the query. This approach makes various assumptions, such as that the document summaries displayed in results lists (on whose basis users choose which documents to click on) are indicative of the relevance of these documents. In the original DirectHit search engine, the data about the click rates on pages was gathered globally, rather than being user or query specific. This is one form of the general area of clickstream mining . Today, a closely related approach is used in ranking the advertisements that match a web search query (Chapter 19 ).
iir_9_1_8	Summary Relevance feedback has been shown to be very effective at improving relevance of results. Its successful use requires queries for which the set of relevant documents is medium to large. Full relevance feedback is often onerous for the user, and its implementation is not very efficient in most IR systems. In many cases, other types of interactive retrieval may improve relevance by about as much with less work. Beyond the core ad hoc retrieval scenario, other uses of relevance feedback include: Following a changing information need (e.g., names of car models of interest change over time) Maintaining an information filter (e.g., for a news feed). Such filters are discussed further in Chapter 13 . Active learning (deciding which examples it is most useful to know the class of to reduce annotation costs). Exercises. Under what conditions would the modified query in Equation 49 be the same as the original query ? In all other cases, is closer than to the centroid of the relevant documents? Why is positive feedback likely to be more useful than negative feedback to an IR system? Why might only using one nonrelevant document be more effective than using several? Suppose that a user's initial query is cheap CDs cheap DVDs extremely cheap CDs. The user examines two documents, and . She judges , with the content CDs cheap software cheap CDs relevant and with content cheap thrills DVDs nonrelevant. Assume that we are using direct term frequency (with no scaling and no document frequency). There is no need to length-normalize vectors. Using Rocchio relevance feedback as in Equation 49 what would the revised query vector be after relevance feedback? Assume . Omar has implemented a relevance feedback web search system, where he is going to do relevance feedback based only on words in the title text returned for a page (for efficiency). The user is going to rank 3 results. The first user, Jinxing, queries for: banana slug and the top three titles returned are: banana slug Ariolimax columbianus Santa Cruz mountains banana slug Santa Cruz Campus Mascot Jinxing judges the first two documents relevant, and the third nonrelevant. Assume that Omar's search engine uses term frequency but no length normalization nor IDF. Assume that he is using the Rocchio relevance feedback mechanism, with . Show the final revised query that would be run. (Please list the vector elements in alphabetical order.)
iir_9_2	Global methods for query reformulation In this section we more briefly discuss three global methods for expanding a query: by simply aiding the user in doing so, by using a manual thesaurus, and through building a thesaurus automatically.   Subsections Vocabulary tools for query reformulation Query expansion Automatic thesaurus generation
iir_9_2_1	Vocabulary tools for query reformulation Various user supports in the search process can help the user see how their searches are or are not working. This includes information about words that were omitted from the query because they were on stop lists, what words were stemmed to, the number of hits on each term or phrase, and whether words were dynamically turned into phrases. The IR system might also suggest search terms by means of a thesaurus or a controlled vocabulary. A user can also be allowed to browse lists of the terms that are in the inverted index, and thus find good terms that appear in the collection.
iir_9_2_2	Query expansion  An example of query expansion in the interface of the Yahoo! web search engine in 2006.The expanded query suggestions appear just below the ``Search Results'' bar. In relevance feedback, users give additional input on documents (by marking documents in the results set as relevant or not), and this input is used to reweight the terms in the query for documents. In query expansion on the other hand, users give additional input on query words or phrases, possibly suggesting additional query terms. Some search engines (especially on the web) suggest related queries in response to a query; the users then opt to use one of these alternative query suggestions. Figure 9.6 shows an example of query suggestion options being presented in the Yahoo! web search engine. The central question in this form of query expansion is how to generate alternative or expanded queries for the user. The most common form of query expansion is global analysis, using some form of thesaurus. For each term in a query, the query can be automatically expanded with synonyms and related words of from the thesaurus. Use of a thesaurus can be combined with ideas of term weighting: for instance, one might weight added terms less than original query terms.   Methods for building a thesaurus for query expansion include: Use of a controlled vocabulary that is maintained by human editors. Here, there is a canonical term for each concept. The subject headings of traditional library subject indexes, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, or the Dewey Decimal system are examples of a controlled vocabulary. Use of a controlled vocabulary is quite common for well-resourced domains. A well-known example is the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) used with MedLine for querying the biomedical research literature. For example, in Figure 9.7 , neoplasms was added to a search for cancer. This Medline query expansion also contrasts with the Yahoo! example. The Yahoo! interface is a case of interactive query expansion, whereas PubMed does automatic query expansion. Unless the user chooses to examine the submitted query, they may not even realize that query expansion has occurred. A manual thesaurus. Here, human editors have built up sets of synonymous names for concepts, without designating a canonical term. The UMLS metathesaurus is one example of a thesaurus. Statistics Canada maintains a thesaurus of preferred terms, synonyms, broader terms, and narrower terms for matters on which the government collects statistics, such as goods and services. This thesaurus is also bilingual English and French. An automatically derived thesaurus. Here, word co-occurrence statistics over a collection of documents in a domain are used to automatically induce a thesaurus; see Section 9.2.3 . Query reformulations based on query log mining. Here, we exploit the manual query reformulations of other users to make suggestions to a new user. This requires a huge query volume, and is thus particularly appropriate to web search.
iir_9_2_3	Automatic thesaurus generation As an alternative to the cost of a manual thesaurus, we could attempt to generate a thesaurus automatically by analyzing a collection of documents. There are two main approaches. One is simply to exploit word cooccurrence. We say that words co-occurring in a document or paragraph are likely to be in some sense similar or related in meaning, and simply count text statistics to find the most similar words. The other approach is to use a shallow grammatical analysis of the text and to exploit grammatical relations or grammatical dependencies. For example, we say that entities that are grown, cooked, eaten, and digested, are more likely to be food items. Simply using word cooccurrence is more robust (it cannot be misled by parser errors), but using grammatical relations is more accurate.   The simplest way to compute a co-occurrence thesaurus is based on term-term similarities. We begin with a term-document matrix , where each cell is a weighted count for term and document , with weighting so has length-normalized rows. If we then calculate , then is a similarity score between terms and , with a larger number being better. Figure 9.8 shows an example of a thesaurus derived in basically this manner, but with an extra step of dimensionality reduction via Latent Semantic Indexing, which we discuss in Chapter 18 . While some of the thesaurus terms are good or at least suggestive, others are marginal or bad. The quality of the associations is typically a problem. Term ambiguity easily introduces irrelevant statistically correlated terms. For example, a query for Apple computer may expand to Apple red fruit computer. In general these thesauri suffer from both false positives and false negatives. Moreover, since the terms in the automatic thesaurus are highly correlated in documents anyway (and often the collection used to derive the thesaurus is the same as the one being indexed), this form of query expansion may not retrieve many additional documents. Query expansion is often effective in increasing recall. However, there is a high cost to manually producing a thesaurus and then updating it for scientific and terminological developments within a field. In general a domain-specific thesaurus is required: general thesauri and dictionaries give far too little coverage of the rich domain-particular vocabularies of most scientific fields. However, query expansion may also significantly decrease precision, particularly when the query contains ambiguous terms. For example, if the user searches for interest rate, expanding the query to interest rate fascinate evaluate is unlikely to be useful. Overall, query expansion is less successful than relevance feedback, though it may be as good as pseudo relevance feedback. It does, however, have the advantage of being much more understandable to the system user. Exercises. If is simply a Boolean cooccurrence matrix, then what do you get as the entries in ?
iir_9_3	References and further reading Work in information retrieval quickly confronted the problem of variant expression which meant that the words in a query might not appear in a document, despite it being relevant to the query. An early experiment about 1960 cited by Swanson (1988) found that only 11 out of 23 documents properly indexed under the subject toxicity had any use of a word containing the stem toxi. There is also the issue of translation, of users knowing what terms a document will use. Blair and Maron (1985) conclude that ``it is impossibly difficult for users to predict the exact words, word combinations, and phrases that are used by all (or most) relevant documents and only (or primarily) by those documents''. The main initial papers on relevance feedback using vector space models all appear in Salton (1971b), including the presentation of the Rocchio algorithm (Rocchio, 1971) and the Ide dec-hi variant along with evaluation of several variants (Ide, 1971). Another variant is to regard all documents in the collection apart from those judged relevant as nonrelevant, rather than only ones that are explicitly judged nonrelevant. However, Schütze et al. (1995) and Singhal et al. (1997) show that better results are obtained for routing by using only documents close to the query of interest rather than all documents. Other later work includes Salton and Buckley (1990), Riezler et al. (2007) (a statistical NLP approach to RF) and the recent survey paper Ruthven and Lalmas (2003). The effectiveness of interactive relevance feedback systems is discussed in (Harman, 1992, Buckley et al., 1994b, Salton, 1989). Koenemann and Belkin (1996) do user studies of the effectiveness of relevance feedback. Traditionally Roget's thesaurus has been the best known English language thesaurus (Roget, 1946). In recent computational work, people almost always use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), not only because it is free, but also because of its rich link structure. It is available at: http://wordnet.princeton.edu. Qiu and Frei (1993) and Schütze (1998) discuss automatic thesaurus generation. Xu and Croft (1996) explore using both local and global query expansion.
mir-0002	1.1    Motivation Information retrieval (IR) deals with the representation, storage, organization of, and access to information items. The representation and organization of the information items should provide the user with easy access to the information in which he is interested. Unfortunately, characterization of the user information need is not a simple problem. Consider, for instance, the following hypothetical user information need in the context of the World Wide Web (or just the Web): Find all the pages (documents) containing information on college tennis teams which: (1) are maintained by an university in the USA and (2) participate in the NCAA tennis tournament. To be relevant, the page must include information on the national ranking of the team in the last three years and the email or phone number of the team coach. Clearly, this full description of the user information need cannot be used directly to request information using the current interfaces of Web search engines. Instead, the user must first translate this information need into a query which can be processed by the search engine (or IR system). In its most common form, this translation yields a set of keywords (or index terms) which summarizes the description of the user information need. Given the user query, the key goal of an IR system is to retrieve information which might be useful or relevant to the user. The emphasis is on the retrieval of information as opposed to the retrieval of data.
mir-0003	1.1.1    Information versus Data Retrieval Data retrieval, in the context of an IR system, consists mainly of determining which documents of a collection contain the keywords in the user query which, most frequently, is not enough to satisfy the user information need. In fact, the user of an IR system is concerned more with retrieving ¶information about a 2        INTRODUCTION subject than with retrieving data which satisfies a given query. A data retrieval language aims at retrieving all objects which satisfy clearly defined conditions such as those in a regular expression or in a relational algebra expression. Thus, for a data retrieval system, a single erroneous object among a thousand retrieved objects means total failure. For an information retrieval system, however, the retrieved objects might be inaccurate and small errors are likely to go unnoticed. The main reason for this difference is that information retrieval usually deals with natural language text which is not always well structured and could be semantically ambiguous. On the other hand, a data retrieval system (such as a relational database) deals with data that has a well defined structure and semantics. Data retrieval, while providing a solution to the user of a database system, does not solve the problem of retrieving information about a subject or topic. To be effective in its attempt to satisfy the user information need, the IR system must somehow interpret' the contents of the information items (documents) in a collection and rank them according to a degree of relevance to the user query. This 'interpretation' of a document content involves extracting syntactic and semantic information from the document text and using this information to match the user information need. The difficulty is not only knowing how to extract this information but also knowing how to use it to decide relevance. Thus, the notion of relevance is at the center of information retrieval. In fact, the primary goal of an IR system is to retrieve all the documents which are relevant to a user query while retrieving as few non-relevant documents as possible.
mir-0004	1.1.2    Information Retrieval at the Center of the Stage In the past 20 years, the area of information retrieval has grown well beyond its primary goals of indexing text and searching for useful documents in a collection. Nowadays, research in IR includes modeling, document classification and categorization, systems architecture, user interfaces, data visualization, filtering, languages, etc.   Despite its maturity, until recently, IR was seen as a narrow area of interest mainly to librarians and information experts. Such a tendentious vision prevailed for many years, despite the rapid dissemination, among users of modern personal computers, of IR tools for multimedia and hypertext applications. In the beginning of the 1990s, a single fact changed once and for all these perceptions ó the introduction of the World Wide Web. The Web is becoming a universal repository of human knowledge and culture which has allowed unprecedent sharing of ideas and information in a scale never seen before. Its success is based on the conception of a standard user interface which is always the same no matter what computational environment is used to run the interface. As a result, the user is shielded from details of communication protocols, machine location, and operating systems. Further, any user can create his own Web documents and make them point to any other Web documents without restrictions. This is a key aspect because it turns the Web into a new publishing medium accessible to everybody. As an immediate BASIC CONCEPTS        3 consequence, any Web user can push his personal agenda with little effort and almost at no cost. This universe without frontiers has attracted tremendous attention from millions of people everywhere since the very beginning. Furthermore, it is causing a revolution in the way people use computers and perform their daily tasks. For instance, home shopping and home banking are becoming very popular and have generated several hundred million dollars in revenues. Despite so much success, the Web has introduced new problems of its own. Finding useful information on the Web is frequently a tedious and difficult task. For instance, to satisfy his information need, the user might navigate the space of Web links (i.e., the hyperspace) searching for information of interest. However, since the hyperspace is vast and almost unknown, such a navigation task is usually inefficient. For naive users, the problem becomes harder, which might entirely frustrate all their efforts. The main obstacle is the absence of a well defined underlying data model for the Web, which implies that information definition and structure is frequently of low quality. These difficulties have attracted renewed interest in IR and its techniques as promising solutions. As a result, almost overnight, IR has gained a place with other technologies at the center of the stage.
mir-0005	1.1.3    Focus of the Book Despite the great increase in interest in information retrieval, modern textbooks on IR with a broad (and extensive) coverage of the various topics in the field are still difficult to find. In an attempt to partially fulfill this gap, this book presents an overall view of research in IR from a computer scientist's perspective. This means that the focus of the book is on computer algorithms and techniques used in information retrieval systems. A rather distinct viewpoint is taken by librarians and information science researchers, who adopt a human-centered interpretation of the IR problem. In this interpretation, the focus is on trying to understand how people interpret and use information as opposed to how to structure, store, and retrieve information automatically. While most of this book is dedicated to the computer scientist's viewpoint of the IR problem, the human-centered viewpoint is discussed to some extent in the last two chapters. We put great emphasis on the integration of the different areas which are closed related to the information retrieval problem and thus, should be treated together. For that reason, besides covering text retrieval, library systems, user interfaces, and the Web, this book also discusses visualization, multimedia retrieval, and digital libraries.
mir-0006	1.2    Basic Concepts The effective retrieval of relevant information is directly affected both by the user task and by the logical view of the documents adopted by the retrieval system, as we now discuss. INTRODUCTION Database Figure 1.1    Interaction of the user with the retrieval system through distinct tasks.
mir-0007	1.2.1    The User Task The user of a retrieval system has to translate his information need into a query in the language provided by the system. With an information retrieval system, this normally implies specifying a set of words which convey the semantics of the information need. With a data retrieval system, a query expression (such as, for instance, a regular expression) is used to convey the constraints that must be satisfied by objects in the answer set. In both cases, we say that the user searches for useful information executing a retrieval task. Consider now a user who has an interest which is either poorly denned or which is inherently broad. For instance, the user might be interested in documents about car racing in general. In this situation, the user might use an interactive interface to simply look around in the collection for documents related to car racing. For instance, he might find interesting documents about Formula 1 racing, about car manufacturers, or about the '24 Hours of Le Mans.1 Furthermore, while reading about the k24 Hours of Le Mans\ he might turn his attention to a document which provides directions to Le Alans and, from there, to documents which cover tourism in France. In this situation, we say that the user is browsing the documents in the collection, not searching. It is still a process of retrieving information, but one whose main objectives are not clearly defined in the beginning and whose purpose might change during the interaction with the system. In this book, we1 make a clear distinction between the different tasks the liber of t lie retrieval system might be engaged in. His task might be of two distinct types: information or data retrieval and browsing. Classic information retrieval systems normally allow information or data retrieval. Hypertext systems are usually tuned for providing quick browsing. Modern digital library and Web interfaces might attempt to combine these tasks to provide improved retrieval capabilities.   However, combination of retrieval and browsing is not yet a well BASIC CONCEPTS         5 established approach and is not the dominant paradigm. Figure 1.1 illustrates the interaction of the user through the different tasks we identify. Information and data retrieval are usually provided by most modern information retrieval systems (such as Web interfaces). Further, such systems might also provide some (still limited) form of browsing. While combining information and data retrieval with browsing is not yet a common practice, it might become so in the future. Both retrieval and browsing are, in the language of the World Wide Web, 'pulling' actions. That is, the user requests the information in an interactive manner. An alternative is to do retrieval in an automatic and permanent fashion using software agents which push the information towards the user. For instance, information useful to a user could be extracted periodically from a news service. In this case, we say that the IR system is executing a particular retrieval task which consists of filtering relevant information for later inspection by the user. We briefly discuss filtering in Chapter 2.
mir-0008	1.2.2    Logical View of the Documents Due to historical reasons, documents in a collection are frequently represented through a set of index terms or keywords. Such keywords might be extracted directly from the text of the document or might be specified by a human subject (as frequently done in the information sciences arena). No matter whether these representative keywords are derived automatically or generated by a specialist, they provide a logical view of the document For a precise definition of the concept of a document and its characteristics, see Chapter 6. Modern computers are making it possible to represent a document by its full set of words. In this case, we say that the retrieval system adopts a full text logical view (or representation) of the documents. With very large collections, however, even modern computers might have to reduce the set of representative keywords. This can be accomplished through the elimination of stopwords (such as articles and connectives), the use of stemming (which reduces distinct words to their common grammatical root), and the identification of noun groups (which eliminates adjectives, adverbs, and verbs). Further, compression might be employed. These operations are called text operations (or transformations) and are covered in detail in Chapter 7. Text operations reduce the complexity of the document representation and allow moving the logical view from that of a full text to that of a set of index terms. The full text is clearly the most complete logical view of a document but its usage usually implies higher computational costs. A small set of categories (generated by a human specialist) provides the most concise logical view of a document but its usage might lead to retrieval of poor quality. Several intermediate logical views (of a document) might be adopted by an information retrieval system as illustrated in Figure 1.2. Besides adopting any of the intermediate representations, the retrieval system might also recognize the internal structure normally present in a document (e.g., chapters, sections, subsections, etc.). This INTRODUCTION Figure 1.2    Logical view of a document: from full text to a set of index terms. information on the structure of the document might be quite useful and is required by structured text retrieval models such as those discussed in Chapter 2. As illustrated in Figure 1.2, we view the issue of logically representing a document as a continuum in which the logical view of a document might shift (smoothly) from a full text representation to a higher level representation specified by a human subject.
mir-0010	1.3    Past, Present, and Future 1.3.1    Early Developments For approximately 4000 years, man has organized information for later retrieval and usage. A typical example is the table of contents of a book. Since the volume of information eventually grew beyond a few books, it became necessary to build specialized data structures to ensure faster access to the stored information. An old and popular data structure for faster information retrieval is a collection of selected words or concepts with which are associated pointers to the related information (or documents) ó the index. In one form or another, indexes are at the core of every modern information retrieval system. They provide faster access to the data and allow the query processing task to be speeded up. A detailed coverage of indexes and their usage for searching can be found in Chapter 8. For centuries, indexes were created manually as categorization hierarchies. In fact, most libraries still use some form of categorical hierarchy to classify their volumes (or documents), as discussed in Chapter 14. Such hierarchies have usually been conceived by human subjects from the library sciences field. More recently, the advent of modern computers has made possible the const ruction of large indexes automatically. Automatic indexes provide a view of the retrieval problem which is much more related to the system itself than to the user need. PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE        7 In this respect, it is important to distinguish between two different views of the IR problem: a computer-centered one and a human-centered one. In the computer-centered view, the IR problem consists mainly of building up efficient indexes, processing user queries with high performance, and developing ranking algorithms which improve the 'quality' of the answer set. In the human-centered view, the IR problem consists mainly of studying the behavior of the user, of understanding his main needs, and of determining how such understanding affects the organization and operation of the retrieval system. According to this view, keyword based query processing might be seen as a strategy which is unlikely to yield a good solution to the information retrieval problem in the long run. In this book, we focus mainly on the computer-centered view of the IR problem because it continues to be dominant in the market place.
mir-0011	1.3.2    Information Retrieval in the Library Libraries were among the first institutions to adopt IR systems for retrieving information. Usually, systems to be used in libraries were initially developed by academic institutions and later by commercial vendors. In the first generation, such systems consisted basically of an automation of previous technologies (such as card catalogs) and basically allowed searches based on author name and title. In the second generation, increased search functionality was added which allowed searching by subject headings, by keywords, and some more complex query facilities. In the third generation, which is currently being deployed, the focus is on improved graphical interfaces, electronic forms, hypertext features, and open system architectures. Traditional library management system vendors include Endeavor Information Systems Inc., Innovative Interfaces Inc., and EOS International. Among systems developed with a research focus and used in academic libraries, we distinguish Okapi (at City University, London), MELVYL (at University of California), and Cheshire II (at UC Berkeley). Further details on these library systems can be found in Chapter 14.
mir-0012	1.3.3    The Web and Digital Libraries If we consider the search engines on the Web today, we conclude that they continue to use indexes which are very similar to those used by librarians a century ago. What has changed then? Three dramatic and fundamental changes have occurred due to the advances in modern computer technology and the boom of the Web. First, it became a lot cheaper to have access to various sources of information. This allows reaching a wider audience than ever possible before. Second, the advances in all kinds of digital communication provided greater access to networks. This implies that the information source is available even if distantly located and that 8        INTRODUCTION the access can be done quickly (frequently, in a few seconds). Third, the freedom to post whatever information someone judges useful has greatly contributed to the popularity of the Web. For the first time in history, many people have free access to a large publishing medium. Fundamentally, low cost, greater access, and publishing freedom have allowed people to use the Web (and modern digital libraries) as a highly interactive medium. Such interactivity allows people to exchange messages, photos, documents, software, videos, and to 'chat' in a convenient and low cost fashion. Further, people can do it at the time of their preference (for instance, you can buy a book late at night) which further improves the convenience of the service. Thus, high interactivity is the fundamental and current shift in the communication paradigm. Searching the Web is covered in Chapter 13, while digital libraries are covered in Chapter 15. In the future, three main questions need to be addressed. First, despite the high interactivity, people still find it difficult (if not impossible) to retrieve information relevant to their information needs. Thus, in the dynamic world of the Web and of large digital libraries, which techniques will allow retrieval of higher quality? Second, with the ever increasing demand for access, quick response is becoming more and more a pressing factor. Thus, which techniques will yield faster indexes and smaller query response times? Third, the quality of the retrieval task is greatly affected by the user interaction with the system. Thus, how will a better understanding of the user behavior affect the design and deployment of new information retrieval strategies?
mir-0013	1.3.4    Practical Issues Electronic commerce is a major trend on the Web nowadays and one which has benefited millions of people. In an electronic transaction, the buyer usually has to submit to the vendor some form of credit information which can be used for charging for the product or service. In its most common form, such information consists of a credit card number. However, since transmitting credit card numbers over the Internet is not a safe procedure, such data is usually transmitted over a fax line. This implies that, at least in the beginning, the transaction between a new user and a vendor requires executing an off-line procedure of several steps before the actual transaction can take place. This situation can be improved if the data is encrypted for security. In fact, some institutions and companies already provide some form of encryption or automatic authentication for security reasons. However, security is not the only concern. Another issue of major interest is privacy. Frequently, people are willing to exchange information as long as it does not become public. The reasons are many but the most common one is to protect oneself against misuse of private information by third parties. Thus, privacy is another issue which affects the deployment of the Web and which has not been properly addressed yet. Two other very important issues are copyright and patent rights. It is far THE RETRIEVAL PROCESS        9 from clear how the wide spread of data on the Web affects copyright and patent laws in the various countries. This is important because it affects the business of building up and deploying large digital libraries. For instance, is a site which supervises all the information it posts acting as a publisher? And if so, is it responsible for a misuse of the information it posts (even if it is not the source)? Additionally, other practical issues of interest include scanning, optical character recognition (OCR), and cross-language retrieval (in which the query is in one language but the documents retrieved are in another language). In this book, however, we do not cover practical issues in detail because it is not our main focus. The reader interested in details of practical issues is referred to the interesting book by Lesk [501].
mir-0014	1.4    The Retrieval Process At this point, we are ready to detail our view of the retrieval process. Such a process is interpreted in terms of component subprocesses whose study yields many of the chapters in this book. To describe the retrieval process, we use a simple and generic software architecture as shown in Figure 1.3. First of all, before the retrieval process can even be initiated, it is necessary to define the text database. This is usually done by the manager of the database, which specifies the following: (a) the documents to be used, (b) the operations to be performed on the text, and (c) the text model (i.e., the text structure and what elements can be retrieved). The text operations transform the original documents and generate a logical view of them. Once the logical view of the documents is defined, the database manager (using the DB Manager Module) builds an index of the text. An index is a critical data structure because it allows fast searching over large volumes of data. Different index structures might be used, but the most popular one is the inverted file as indicated in Figure 1.3. The resources (time and storage space) spent on defining the text database and building the index are amortized by querying the retrieval system many times. Given that the document database is indexed, the retrieval process can be initiated. The user first specifies a user need which is then parsed and transformed by the same text operations applied to the text. Then, query operations might be applied before the actual query, which provides a system representation for the user need, is generated. The query is then processed to obtain the retrieved documents. Fast query processing is made possible by the index structure previously built. Before been sent to the user, the retrieved documents are ranked according to a likelihood of relevance. The user then examines the set of ranked documents in the search for useful information. At this point, he might pinpoint a subset of the documents seen as definitely of interest and initiate a user feedback cycle. In such a cycle, the system uses the documents selected by the user to change the query formulation. Hopefully, this modified query is a better representation 10        INTRODUCTION user need User Interface Text 4, 10 Text Text  Operations user feedback logical view logical view Query Operations query 6,7 Indexing DB Manager Module inverted file Searching retrieved docs Index ranked docs Ranking Text Database Figure 1.3    The process of retrieving information (the numbers beside each box indicate the chapters that cover the corresponding topic). of the real user need. The small numbers outside the lower right corner of various boxes in Figure 1.3 indicate the chapters in this book which discuss the respective subpro-cesses in detail A brief introduction to each of these chapters can be found in section 1.5. Consider now the user interfaces available with current information retrieval systems (including Web search engines and Web browsers). We first notice that the user almost never declares his information need. Instead, he is required to provide a direct representation for the query that the system will execute. Since most users have no knowledge of text and query operations, the query they provide is frequently inadequate. Therefore, it is not surprising to observe that poorly formulated queries lead to poor retrieval (as happens so often on the Web).
mir-0015	1.5    Organization of the Book For ease of comprehension, this book has a straightforward structure in which four main parts are distinguished: text IR, human-computer interaction (HCI) ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK 11 for IR, multimedia IR, and applications of IR. Text IR discusses the classic problem of searching a collection of documents for useful information. HCI for IR discusses current trends in IR towards improved user interfaces and better data visualization tools. Multimedia IR discusses how to index document images and other binary data by extracting features from their content and how to search them efficiently. On the other hand, document images that are predominantly text (rather than pictures) are called textual images and are amenable to automatic extraction of keywords through metadescriptors, and can be retrieved using text IR techniques. Applications of IR covers modern applications of IR such as the Web, bibliographic systems, and digital libraries. Each part is divided into topics which we now discuss.
mir-0016	1.5.1    Book Topics The four parts which compose this book are subdivided into eight topics as illustrated in Figure 1.4. These eight topics are as follows. The topic Retrieval Models  Evaluation discusses the traditional models of searching text for useful information and the procedures for evaluating an information retrieval system. The topic Improvements on Retrieval discusses techniques for transforming the query and the text of the documents with the aim of improving retrieval. The topic Efficient Processing discusses indexing and searching approaches for speeding up the retrieval. These three topics compose the first part on Text IR. The topic Interfaces  Visualization covers the interaction of the user with the information retrieval system. The focus is on interfaces which facilitate the process of specifying a query and provide a good visualization of the results. The topic Multimedia Modeling  Searching discusses the utilization of multimedia data with information retrieval systems. The focus is on modeling, indexing, and searching multimedia data such as voice, images, and other binary data. text m.

Techniques developed for the first two applications support the deployment of the latter. The eight topics distinguished above generate the 14 chapters, besides this introduction, which compose this book and which we now briefly introduce.
mir-0017	1.5.2    Book Chapters Figure 1.5 illustrates the overall structure of this book.   The reasoning which yielded the chapters from 2 to 15 is as follows.

In the traditional keyword-based approach, the user specifies his information need by providing sets of keywords and the information system retrieves the documents which best approximate the user query. Also, the information system ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK        13 might attempt to rank the retrieved documents using some measure of relevance. This ranking task is critical in the process of attempting to satisfy the user information need and is the main goal of modeling in IR. Thus, information retrieval models are discussed early in Chapter 2. The discussion introduces many of the fundamental concepts in information retrieval and lays down much of the foundation for the subsequent chapters. Our coverage is detailed and broad. Classic models (Boolean, vector, and probabilistic), modern probabilistic variants (belief network models), alternative paradigms (extended Boolean, generalized vector, latent semantic indexing, neural networks, and fuzzy retrieval), structured text retrieval, and models for browsing (hypertext) are all carefully introduced and explained. Once a new retrieval algorithm (maybe based on a new retrieval model) is conceived, it is necessary to evaluate its performance. Traditional evaluation strategies usually attempt to estimate the costs of the new algorithm in terms of time and space. With an information retrieval system, however, there is the additional issue of evaluating the relevance of the documents retrieved. For this purpose, text reference collections and evaluation procedures based on variables other than time and space are used. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the discussion of retrieval evaluation. In traditional IR, queries are normally expressed as a set of keywords which is quite convenient because the approach is simple and easy to implement. However, the simplicity of the approach prevents the formulation of more elaborate querying tasks. For instance, queries which refer to both the structure and the content of the text cannot be formulated. To overcome this deficiency, more sophisticated query languages are required. Chapter 4 discusses various types of query languages. Since now the user might refer to the structure of a document in his query, this structure has to be defined. This is done by embedding the description of a document content and of its structure in a text language such as the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). As illustrated in Figure 1.5, Chapter 6 is dedicated to the discussion of text languages. Retrieval based on keywords might be of fairly low quality. Two possible reasons are as follows. First, the user query might be composed of too few terms which usually implies that the query context is poorly characterized. This is frequently the case, for instance, in the Web. This problem is dealt with through transformations in the query such as query expansion and user relevance feedback. Such query operations are covered in Chapter 5. Second, the set of keywords generated for a given document might fail to summarize its semantic content properly. This problem is dealt with through transformations in the text such as identification of noun groups to be used as keywords, stemming, and the use of a thesaurus. Additionally, for reasons of efficiency, text compression can be employed. Chapter 7 is dedicated to text operations. Given the user query, the information system has to retrieve the documents which are related to that query. The potentially large size of the document collection (e.g., the Web is composed of millions of documents) implies that specialized indexing techniques must be used if efficient retrieval is to be achieved. Thus, to speed up the task of matching documents to queries, proper indexing and search14       INTRODUCTION ing techniques are used as discussed in Chapter 8. Additionally, query processing can be further accelerated through the adoption of parallel and distributed IR techniques as discussed in Chapter 9. As illustrated in Figure 1.5, all the key issues regarding Text IR, from modeling to fast query processing, are covered in this book. Modern user interfaces implement strategies which assist the user to form a query. The main objective is to allow him to define more precisely the context associated to his information need. The importance of query contextualization is a consequence of the difficulty normally faced by users during the querying process. Consider, for instance, the problem of quickly finding useful information in the Web. Navigation in hyperspace is not a good solution due to the absence of a logical and semantically well defined structure (the Web has no underlying logical model). A popular approach for specifying a user query in the Web consists of providing a set of keywords which are searched for. Unfortunately, the number of terms provided by a common user is small (typically, fewer than four) which usually implies that the query is vague. This means that new user interface paradigms which assist the user with the query formation process are required. Further, since a vague user query usually retrieves hundreds of documents, the conventional approach of displaying these documents as items of a scrolling list is clearly inadequate. To deal with this problem, new data visualization paradigms have been proposed in recent years. The main trend is towards visualization of a large subset of the retrieved documents at once and direct manipulation of the whole subset. User interfaces for assisting the user to form his query and current approaches for visualization of large data sets are covered in Chapter 10. Following this, we discuss the application of IR techniques to multimedia data. The key issue is how to model, index, and search structured documents which contain multimedia objects such as digitized voice, images, and other binary data. Models and query languages for office and medical information retrieval systems are covered in Chapter 11. Efficient indexing and searching of multimedia objects is covered in Chapter 12. Some readers may argue that the models and techniques for multimedia retrieval are rather different from those for classic text retrieval. However, we take into account that images and text are usually together and that with the Web, other media types (such as video and audio) can also be mixed in. Therefore, we believe that in the future, all the above will be treated in a unified and consistent manner. Our book is a first step in that direction. The final three chapters of the book are dedicated to applications of modern information retrieval: the Web, bibliographic systems, and digital libraries. As illustrated in Figure 1.5, Chapter 13 presents the Web and discusses the main problems related to the issue of searching the Web for useful information. Also, our discussion covers briefly the most popular search engines in the Web presenting particularities of their organization. Chapter 14 covers commercial document databases and online public access catalogs. Commercial document databases are still the largest information retrieval systems nowadays. LEXIS-NEXIS, for instance, has a database with 1.3 billion documents and attends to over 120 million query requests annually.  Finally, Chapter 15 discusses modern digital HOW TO USE THIS BOOK        15 libraries. Architectural issues, models, prototypes, and standards are all covered. The discussion also introduces the '5S' model (streams, structures, spaces, scenarios and societies) as a framework for providing theoretical and practical unification of digital libraries.
mir-0018	1.6    How to Use this Book Although several people have contributed chapters for this book, it is really a textbook. The contents and the structure of the book have been carefully designed by the two main authors who also authored or coauthored nine of the 15 chapters in the book. Further, all the contributed chapters have been judiciously edited and integrated into a unifying framework that provides uniformity in structure and style, a common glossary, a common bibliography, and appropriate cross-references. At the end of each chapter, a discussion on research issues, trends, and selected bibliography is included. This discussion should be useful for graduate students as well as for researchers. Furthermore, the book is complemented by a Web page with additional information and resources.
mir-0019	1.6.1    Teaching Suggestions This textbook can be used in many different areas including computer science (CS), information systems, and library science. The following list gives suggested contents for different courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, based on syllabuses of many universities around the world: ï  Information Retrieval (Computer Science, undergraduate): this is the standard course for many CS programs.   The minimum content should include Chapters 1 to 8 and Chapter 10, that is, most of the part on Text IR complemented with the chapter on user interfaces. Some specific topics of those chapters, such as more advanced models for IR and sophisticated algorithms for indexing and searching, can be omitted to fit a one term course. The chapters on Applications of IR can be mentioned briefly at the end. ï  Advanced Information Retrieval (Computer Science, graduate): similar to the previous course but with more detailed coverage of the various chapters particularly modeling and searching (assuming the previous course as a requirement).  In addition, Chapter 9 and Chapters 13 to 15 should be covered completely. Emphasis on research problems and new results is a must. ï  Information  Retrieval  (Information  Systems,   undergraduate):    this course is similar to the CS course, but with a different emphasis. It should include Chapters 1 to 7 and Chapter 10. Some notions from Chapter 8 are 16        INTRODUCTION useful but not crucial. At the end, the system-oriented parts of the chapters on Applications of IR, in particular those on Bibliographic Systems and Digital Libraries, must be covered (this material can be complemented with topics from [501]). ï  Information Retrieval (Library Science, undergraduate): similar to the previous course, but removing the more technical and advanced material of Chapters 2, 5, and 7. Also, greater emphasis should be put on the chapters on Bibliographic Systems and Digital Libraries.   The course should be complemented with a thorough discussion of the user-centered view of the IR problem (for example, using the book by Allen [13]). ï  Multimedia Retrieval (Computer Science, undergraduate or graduate): this course should include Chapters 1 to 3, 6, and 11 to 15. The emphasis could be on multimedia itself or on the integration of classical IR with multimedia. The course can be complemented with one of the many books on this topic, which are usually more broad and technical. ï  Topics in IR (Computer Science, graduate): many chapters of the book can be used for this course. It can emphasize modeling and evaluation or user interfaces and visualization. It can also be focused on algorithms and data structures (in that case, [275] and [825] are good complements).  A multimedia focus is also possible, starting with Chapters 11 and 12 and using more specific books later on. ï  Topics in IR (Information Systems or Library Science, graduate) similar to the above but with emphasis on non-technical parts. For example, the course could cover modeling and evaluation, query languages, user interfaces, and visualization. The chapters on applications can also be considered. ï  Web Retrieval and Information Access (generic, undergraduate or graduate): this course should emphasize hypertext, concepts coming from networks and distributed systems and multimedia.  The kernel should be the basic models of Chapter 2 followed by Chapters 3, 4, and 6.   Also, Chapters 11 and 13 to 15 should be discussed. ï  Digital Libraries (generic, undergraduate or graduate): This course could start with part of Chapters 2 to 4 and 6, followed by Chapters 10, 14, and 15. The kernel of the course could be based on the book by Lesk [501]. IVIore bibliography useful for many of the courses above is discussed in the last section of this chapter.
mir-0020	1.6.2    The Book's Web Page As IR is a very dynamic area nowadays, a book by itself is not enough. For that reason (and many others), the book has a Web home page located and mirrored in the following places (mirrors in USA and Europe are also planned): BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        17 ï  Brazil: http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/irbook ï  Chile: http://sunsite.dcc.ucliile.cl/irbook Comments, suggestions, contributions, or mistakes found are welcome through email to the contact authors given on the Web page. The Web page contains the Table of Contents, Preface, Acknowledgements, Introduction, Glossary, and other appendices to the book. It also includes exercises and teaching materials that will be increasing in volume and changing with time. In addition, a reference collection (containing 1239 documents on Cystic Fibrosis and 100 information requests with extensive relevance evaluation [721]) is available for experimental purposes. Furthermore, the page includes useful pointers to IR syllabuses in different universities, IR research groups, IR publications, and other resources related to IR and this book. Finally, any new important results or additions to the book as well as an errata will be made publicly available there.
mir-0021	1.7    Bibliographic Discussion Many other books have been written on information retrieval, and due to the current widespread interest in the subject, new books have appeared recently. In the following, we briefly compare our book with these previously published works. Classic references in the field of information retrieval are the books by van Rijsbergen [785] and Salton and McGill [698]. Our distinction between data and information retrieval is borrowed from the former. Our definition of the information retrieval process is influenced by the latter. However, almost 20 years later, both books are now outdated and do not cover many of the new developments in information retrieval. Three more recent and also well known references in information retrieval are the book edited by Frakes and Baeza-Yates [275], the book by Witten, Moffat, and Bell [825], and the book by Lesk [501]. All these three books are complementary to this book. The first is focused on data structures and algorithms for information retrieval and is useful whenever quick prototyping of a known algorithm is desired. The second is focused on indexing and compression, and covers images besides text. For instance, our definition of a textual image is borrowed from it. The third is focused on digital libraries and practical issues such as history, distribution, usability, economics, and property rights. On the issue of computer-centered and user-centered retrieval, a generic book on information systems that takes the latter view is due to Allen [13]. There are other complementary books for specific chapters. For example, there are many books on IR and hypertext. The same is true for generic or specific multimedia retrieval, as images, audio or video. Although not an information retrieval title, the book by Rosenfeld and Morville [682] on information architecture of the Web, is a good complement to our chapter on searching the 18        INTRODUCTION Web. The book by Menasce and Almeida [554] demonstrates how to use queue-ing theory for predicting Web server performance. In addition, there are many books that explain how to find information on the Web and how to use search engines. The reference edited by Sparck Jones and Willet [414], which was long awaited, is really a collection of papers rather than an edited book. The coherence and breadth of coverage in our book makes it more appropriate as a textbook in a formal discipline. Nevertheless, this collection is a valuable research tool. A collection of papers on cross-language information retrieval was recently edited by Grefenstette [323]. This book is a good complement to ours for people interested in this particular topic. Additionally, a collection focused on intelligent IR was edited recently by Maybury [550], and another collection on natural language IR edited by Strzalkowski will appear soon [748]. The book by Korfhage [451] covers a lot less material and its coverage is not as detailed as ours. For instance, it includes no detailed discussion of digital libraries, the Web, multimedia, or parallel processing. Similarly, the books by Kowalski [459] and Shapiro et al. [719] do not cover these topics in detail, and have a different orientation. Finally, the recent book by Grossman and Frieder [326] does not discuss the Web, digital libraries, or visual interfaces. For people interested in research results, the main journals on IR are: Journal of the American Society of Information Sciences (JASIS) published by Wiley and Sons, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Information Processing  Management (IPM, Elsevier), Information Systems (Elsevier), Information Retrieval (Kluwer), and Knowledge and Information Systems (Springer). The main conferences are: ACM SIGIR International Conference on Information Retrieval, ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries (ACM digital library), ACM Conference on Information Knowledge and Management (CIKM), and Text RE-trieval Conference (TREC). Regarding events of regional influence, we would like to acknowledge the SPIRE (South American Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval) symposium.
mir-0023	2.1    Introduction Traditional information retrieval systems usually adopt index terms to index and retrieve documents. In a restricted sense, an index term is a keyword (or group of related words) which has some meaning of its own (i.e., which usually has the semantics of a noun). In its more general form, an index term is simply any word which appears in the text of a document in the collection. Retrieval based on index terms is simple but raises key questions regarding the information retrieval task. For instance, retrieval using index terms adopts as a fundamental foundation the idea that the semantics of the documents and of the user information need can be naturally expressed through sets of index terms. Clearly, this is a considerable oversimplification of the problem because a lot of the semantics in a document or user request is lost when we replace its text with a set of words. Furthermore, matching between each document and the user request is attempted in this very imprecise space of index terms. Thus, it is no surprise that the documents retrieved in response to a user request expressed as a set of keywords are frequently irrelevant. If one also considers that most users have no training in properly forming their queries, the problem is worsened with potentially disastrous results. The frequent dissatisfaction of Web users with the answers they normally obtain is just one good example of this fact. Clearly, one central problem regarding information retrieval systems is the issue of predicting which documents are relevant and which are not. Such a decision is usually dependent on a ranking algorithm which attempts to establish a simple ordering of the documents retrieved. Documents appearing at the top of this ordering are considered to be more likely to be relevant. Thus, ranking algorithms are at the core of information retrieval systems. A ranking algorithm operates according to basic premises regarding the notion of document relevance. Distinct sets of premises (regarding document relevance) yield distinct information retrieval models. The IR model adopted determines the predictions of what is relevant and what is not (i.e., the notion of relevance implemented by the system). The purpose of this chapter is to cover the most Important Information retrieval models proposed over the years.  By 19 20        MODELING doing so, the chapter also provides a conceptual basis for most of the remaining chapters in this book. We first propose a taxonomy for categorizing the 15 IR models we cover. Second, we distinguish between two types of user retrieval tasks: ad hoc and filtering. Third, we present a formal characterization of IR models which is useful for distinguishing the various components of a particular model. Last, we discuss each of the IR models included in our taxonomy.
mir-0024	2.2    A Taxonomy of Information Retrieval Models The three classic models in information retrieval are called Boolean, vector, and probabilistic. In the Boolean model, documents and queries are represented as sets of index terms. Thus, as suggested in [327], we say that the model is set theoretic. In the vector model, documents and queries are represented as vectors in a t-dimensional space. Thus, we say that the model is algebraic. In the probabilistic model, the framework for modeling document and query representations is based on probability theory. Thus, as the name indicates, we say that the model is probabilistic. Over the years, alternative modeling paradigms for each type of classic model (i.e., set theoretic, algebraic, and probabilistic) have been proposed. Regarding alternative set theoretic models, we distinguish the fuzzy and the extended Boolean models. Regarding alternative algebraic models, we distinguish the generalized vector, the latent semantic indexing, and the neural network models. Regarding alternative probabilistic models, we distinguish the inference network and the belief network models. Figure 2.1 illustrates a taxonomy of these information retrieval models. Besides references to the text content, the model might also allow references to the structure normally present in written text. In this case, we say that we have a structured model. We distinguish two models for structured text retrieval namely, the non-overlapping lists model and the proximal nodes model. As discussed in Chapter 1, the user task might be one of browsing (instead of retrieval). In Figure 2.1, we distinguish three models for browsing namely, flat, structure guided, and hypertext. The organization of this chapter follows the taxonomy of information retrieval models depicted in the figure.We first discuss the three classic models. Second, we discuss the alternative models for each type of classic model. Third, we cover structured text retrieval models. At the end, we discuss models for browsing. We emphasize that the IR model (Boolean, vector, probabilistic, etc.), the logical view of the documents (full text, set of index terms, etc.), and the user task (retrieval, browsing) are orthogonal aspects of a retrieval system as detailed in Chapter 1. Thus, despite the fact that some models are more appropriate for a certain user task than for another, the same IR model can be used with distinct document logical views to perform different user tasks. Figure 2.2 illustrates the retrieval models most frequently associated with each one of six distinct combinations of a document logical view and a user task.

mir-0025	2.3    Retrieval: Ad hoc and Filtering In a conventional information retrieval system, the documents in the collection remain relatively static while new queries are submitted to the system. This operational mode has been termed ad hoc retrieval in recent years and is the 22        MODELING most common form of user task. A similar but distinct task is one in which the queries remain relatively static while new documents come into the system (and leave). For instance, this is the case with the stock market and with news wiring services. This operational mode has been termed filtering. In a filtering task [74], a user profile describing the user's preferences is constructed. Such a profile is then compared to the incoming documents in an attempt to determine those which might be of interest to this particular user. For instance, this approach can be used to select a news article among thousands of articles which are broadcast each day. Other potential scenarios for the application of filtering include the selection of preferred judicial decisions, or the selection of articles from daily newspapers, etc. Typically, the filtering task simply indicates to the user the documents which might be of interest to him. The task of determining which ones are really relevant is fully reserved to the user. Not even a ranking of the filtered documents is provided. A variation of this procedure is to rank the filtered documents and show this ranking to the user. The motivation is that the user can examine a smaller number of documents if he assumes that the ones at the top of this ranking are more likely to be relevant. This variation of filtering is called routing (see Chapter 3) but it is not popular. Even if no ranking is presented to the user, the filtering task can compute an internal ranking to determine potentially relevant documents. For instance, documents with a ranking above a given threshold could be selected; the others would be discarded. Any IR model can be adopted to rank the documents, but the vector model is usually preferred due to its simplicity. At this point, we observe that filtering is really a type of user task (or operational mode) and not a model of information retrieval. Thus, the task of filtering and the IR model adopted are orthogonal aspects of an IR system. In a filtering task, the crucial step is not the ranking itself but the construction of a user profile which truly reflects the user's preferences. Many approaches for constructing user profiles have been proposed and here we briefly discuss a couple of them. A simplistic approach for constructing a user profile is to describe the profile through a set of keywords and to require the user to provide the necessary keywords. The approach is simplistic because it requires the user to do too much. In fact, if the user is not familiar with the service which generates the upcoming documents, he might find it fairly difficult to provide the keywords which appropriately describe his preferences in that context. Furthermore, an attempt by the user to familiarize himself with the vocabulary of the upcoming documents might turn into a tedious and time consuming exercise. Thus, despite its feasibility, requiring the user to precisely describe his profile might be impractical. A more elaborate alternative is to collect information from the user about his preferences and to use this information to build the user profile dynamically. This can be accomplished as follows. In the very beginning, the user provides a set of keywords which describe an initial (and primitive) profile of his preferences. As new documents arrive, the system uses this profile to select documents which are potentially of interest and A FORMAL CHARACTERIZATION OF IR MODELS        23 shows them to the user. The user then goes through a relevance feedback cycle (see Chapter 5) in which he indicates not only the documents which are really relevant but also the documents which are non-relevant. The system uses this information to adjust the user profile description such that it reflects the new preferences just declared. Of course, with this procedure the profile is continually changing. Hopefully, however, it stabilizes after a while and no longer changes drastically (unless, of course, the user's interests shift suddenly). Chapter 5 illustrates mechanisms which can be used to dynamically update a keyword-based profile. Prom the above, it should be clear that the filtering task can be viewed as a conventional information retrieval task in which the documents are the ones which keep arriving at the system. Ranking can be computed as before. The difficulty with filtering resides in describing appropriately the user's preferences in a user profile. The most common approaches for deriving a user profile are based on collecting relevant information from the user, deriving preferences from this information, and modifying the user profile accordingly. Since the number of potential applications of filtering keeps increasing, we should see in the future a renewed interest in the study and usage of the technique.
mir-0026	2.4    A Formal Characterization of IR Models We have argued that the fundamental premises which form the basis for a ranking algorithm determine the IR model. Throughout this chapter, we will discuss different sets of such premises. However, before doing so, we should state clearly what exactly an IR model is. Our characterization is as follows. Definition An information retrieval model is a quadruple [D,Q, T, R{qi,dj)J where (1)  D is a set composed of logical views (or representations) for the documents in the collection. (2)  Q is a set composed of logical views (or representations) for the user information needs. Such representations are called queries. (3)  Tis a framework for modeling document representations, queries, and their relationships. (4)  R{qi,dj) is a ranking function which associates a real number with a query qt Ä Q and a document representation dj G D.  Such ranking defines an ordering among the documents with regard to the query qi. To build a model, we think first of representations for the documents and for the user information need. Given these representations, we then conceive the framework in which they can be modeled. This framework should also provide the intuition for constructing a ranking function. For instance, for the classic Boolean model, the framework is composed of sets of documents and the standard operations on sets. For the classic vector model, the framework is composed of a 24        MODELING t-dimensional vectorial space and standard linear algebra operations on vectors. For the classic probabilistic model, the framework is composed of sets, standard probability operations, and the Bayes' theorem. In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss the various IR models shown in Figure 2.1. Throughout the discussion, we do not explicitly instantiate the components D, Q, T, and R(qu dj) of each model. Such components should be quite clear from the discussion and can be easily inferred.
mir-0027	2.5    Classic Information Retrieval In this section we briefly present the three classic models in information retrieval namely, the Boolean, the vector, and the probabilistic models.
mir-0028	2.5.1    Basic Concepts The classic models in information retrieval consider that each document is described by a set of representative keywords called index terms. An index term is simply a (document) word whose semantics helps in remembering the document's main themes. Thus, index terms are used to index and summarize the document contents. In general, index terms are mainly nouns because nouns have meaning by themselves and thus, their semantics is easier to identify and to grasp. Adjectives, adverbs, and connectives are less useful as index terms because they work mainly as complements. However, it might be interesting to consider all the distinct words in a document collection as index terms. For instance, this approach is adopted by some Web search engines as discussed in Chapter 13 (in which case, the document logical view is full text). We postpone a discussion on the problem of how to generate index terms until Chapter 7, where the issue is covered in detail. Given a set of index terms for a document, we notice that not all terms are equally useful for describing the document contents. In fact, there are index terms which are simply vaguer than others. Deciding on the importance of a term for summarizing the contents of a document is not a trivial issue. Despite this difficulty, there are properties of an index term which are easily measured and which are useful for evaluating the potential of a term as such. For instance, consider a collection with a hundred thousand documents. A word which appears in each of the one hundred thousand documents is completely useless as an index term because it does not tell us anything about which documents the user might be interested in. On the other hand, a word which appears in just five documents is quite useful because it narrows down considerably the space of documents which might be of interest to the user. Thus, it should be clear that distinct index terms have varying relevance when used to describe document contents. This effect is captured through the assignment of numerical weights to each index term of a document. CLASSIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL        25 Let ki be an index term, dj be a document, and WitJ gt; 0 be a weight associated with the pair (ki.dj). This weight quantifies the importance of the index term for describing the document semantic contents. Definition Let t be the number of index terms in the system and ki be a generic index term. K = {/ci,..., kt} is the set of all index terms. A weight wtj gt; 0 is associated with each index term ki of a document dj. For an index term which does not appear in the document text, Wij = 0. With the document dj is associated an index term vector dj represented by dj = (wij,W2j, . ï ï ,wt,j)-Further, let gi be a function that returns the weight associated with the index term ki in any t-dimensional vector (i.e., gi{dj) = Wij). As we later discuss, the index term weights are usually assumed to be mutually independent. This means that knowing the weight w%^ associated with the pair (ki,dj) tells us nothing about the weight Wi+ii3 associated with the pair (ki+i,dj). This is clearly a simplification because occurrences of index terms in a document are not uncorrelated. Consider, for instance, that the terms computer and network are used to index a given document which covers the area of computer networks. Frequently, in this document, the appearance of one of these two words attracts the appearance of the other. Thus, these two words are correlated and their weights could reflect this correlation. While mutual independence seems to be a strong simplification, it does simplify the task of computing index term weights and allows for fast ranking computation. Furthermore, taking advantage of index term correlations for improving the final document ranking is not a simple task. In fact, none of the many approaches proposed in the past has clearly demonstrated that index term correlations are advantageous (for ranking purposes) with general collections. Therefore, unless clearly stated otherwise, we assume mutual independence among index terms. In Chapter 5 we discuss modern retrieval techniques which are based on term correlations and which have been tested successfully with particular collections. These successes seem to be slowly shifting the current understanding towards a more favorable view of the usefulness of term correlations for information retrieval systems. The above definitions provide support for discussing the three classic information retrieval models, namely, the Boolean, the vector, and the probabilistic models, as we now do.
mir-0029	2.5.2    Boolean Model The Boolean model is a simple retrieval model based on set theory and Boolean algebra. Since the concept of a set is quite intuitive, the Boolean model provides a framework which is easy to grasp by a common user of an IR system. Furthermore, the queries are specified as Boolean expressions which have precise semantics. Given its inherent simplicity and neat formalism, the Boolean model received great attention in past years and was adopted by many of the early commercial bibliographic systems. 26        MODELING k Figure 2.3    The three conjunctive components for the query [q = ka A (fc V -gt;kc)]. Unfortunately, the Boolean model suffers from major drawbacks. First, its retrieval strategy is based on a binary decision criterion (i.e., a document is predicted to be either relevant or non-relevant) without any notion of a grading scale, which prevents good retrieval performance. Thus, the Boolean model is in reality much more a data (instead of information) retrieval model. Second, while Boolean expressions have precise semantics, frequently it is not simple to translate an information need into a Boolean expression. In fact, most users find it difficult and awkward to express their query requests in terms of Boolean expressions. The Boolean expressions actually formulated by users often are quite simple (see Chapter 10 for a more thorough discussion on this issue). Despite these drawbacks, the Boolean model is still the dominant model with commercial document database systems and provides a good starting point for those new to the field. The Boolean model considers that index terms are present or absent in a document. As a result, the index term weights are assumed to be all binary, i.e., Wij G {0,1}. A query q is composed of index terms linked by three connectives: not, and, or.Thus, a query is essentially a conventional Boolean expression which can be represented as a disjunction of conjunctive vectors (i.e., in disjunctive normal form ó DNF). For instance, the query [q = ka A (fc V ^kc)] can be written in disjunctive normal form as [qdnf ó (1? 1gt; 1) V (1? 1? 0) V (1,0,0)], where each of the components is a binary weighted vector associated with the tuple (ka, fc, kc). These binary weighted vectors are called the conjunctive components of qdnf-Figure 2.3 illustrates the three conjunctive components for the query q. Definition     For the Boolean model, the index term weight variables are all binary i.e., u^j £ {0,1}.  A query q is a conventional Boolean expression.  Let qdnf be the disjunctive normal form for the query q. Further, let qcc be any of the conjunctive components of qdnf- The similarity of a document dj to the query q is defined as simid   a) = { J         \ 0    otherwise CLASSIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL         27 If sim(dj1q) = 1 then the Boolean model predicts that the document dj is relevant to the query q (it might not be). Otherwise, the prediction is that the document is not relevant. The Boolean model predicts that each document is either relevant or non-relevant There is no notion of a partial match to the query conditions. For instance, let dj be a document for which dj = (0,1,0). Document dj includes the index term fc but is considered non-relevant to the query [q = feo A(fc V-ifec)]. The main advantages of the Boolean model are the clean formalism behind the model and its simplicity. The main disadvantages are that exact matching may lead to retrieval of too few or too many documents (see Chapter 10). Today, it is well known that index term weighting can lead to a substantial improvement in retrieval performance. Index term weighting brings us to the vector model.
mir-0030	2.5.3    Vector Model The vector model [697, 695] recognizes that the use of binary weights is too limiting and proposes a framework in which partial matching is possible. This is accomplished by assigning non-binary weights to index terms in queries and in documents. These term weights are ultimately used to compute the degree of similarity between each document stored in the system and the user query. By sorting the retrieved documents in decreasing order of this degree of similarity, the vector model takes into consideration documents which match the query terms only partially. The main resultant effect is that the ranked document answer set is a lot more precise (in the sense that it better matches the user information need) than the document answer set retrieved by the Boolean model. Definition For the vector model, the weight W{j associated with a pair ($, d3) is positive and non-binary. Further, the index terms in the query are also weighted. Let Wi^q be the weight associated with the pair [ki,q], where w^q gt; 0. Then, the query vector q is defined as q = (wiyq,W2,q,..gt; lt;,wtiq) where t is the total number of index terms in the system. As before, the vector for a document Therefore, a document dj and a user query q are represented as t-dimensional vectors as shown in Figure 2.4. The vector model proposes to evaluate the degree of similarity of the document dj with regard to the query q as the correlation between the vectors dj and q. This correlation can be quantified, for instance, by the cosine of the angle between these two vectors. That is, -    ti     \          dj9q sirn(dj,q)    =    --fóó \dj\ x \q\ 28        MODELING Figure 2.4    The cosine of 0 is adopted as sim(d3,q). where \dj\ and \q\ are the norms of the document and query vectors. The factor \q\ does not affect the ranking (i.e., the ordering of the documents) because it is the same for all documents. The factor \d3\ provides a normalization in the space of the documents. Since wzj gt; 0 and w^q gt; 0, sim(q, dj) varies from 0 to +1. Thus, instead of attempting to predict whether a document is relevant or not, the vector model ranks the documents according to their degree of similarity to the query. A document might be retrieved even if it matches the query only partially. For instance, one can establish a threshold on sim(d3,q) and retrieve the documents with a degree of similarity above that threshold. But to compute rankings we need first to specify how index term weights are obtained. Index term weights can be calculated in many different ways. The work by Salton and McGill [698] reviews various term-weighting techniques. Here, we do not discuss them in detail. Instead, we concentrate on elucidating the main idea behind the most effective term-weighting techniques. This idea is related to the basic principles which support clustering techniques, as follows. Given a collection C of objects and a vague description of a set A, the goal of a simple clustering algorithm might be to separate the collection C of objects into two sets: a first one which is composed of objects related to the set A and a second one which is composed of objects not related to the set A. Vague description here means that we do not have complete information for deciding precisely which objects are and wThich are not in the set A. For instance, one might be looking for a set .4 of cars which have a price comparable to that of a Lexus 400. Since it is not clear what the term comparable means exactly, there is not a precise (and unique) description of the set A. More sophisticated clustering algorithms might attempt to separate the objects of a collection into various clusters (or classes) according to their properties. For instance, patients of a doctor specializing in cancer could be classified into five classes: terminal, advanced, metastasis, diagnosed, and healthy. Again, the possible class descriptions might be imprecise (and not unique) and the problem is one of deciding to which of these classes a new patient should be assigned. In what follows, however, wre only discuss the simpler version of the clustering problem (i.e., the one which considers only two classes) because all that is required is a decision on which documents are predicted to be relevant and which ones are predicted to be not relevant (with regard to a given user query). CLASSIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL        29 To view the IR problem as one of clustering, we refer to the early work of Salton. We think of the documents as a collection C of objects and think of the user query as a (vague) specification of a set A of objects. In this scenario, the IR problem can be reduced to the problem of determining which documents are in the set A and which ones are not (i.e., the IR problem can be viewed as a clustering problem). In a clustering problem, two main issues have to be resolved. First, one needs to determine what are the features which better describe the objects in the set A. Second, one needs to determine what are the features which better distinguish the objects in the set A from the remaining objects in the collection C. The first set of features provides for quantification of intra-cluster similarity, while the second set of features provides for quantification of inter-cluster dissimilarity. The most successful clustering algorithms try to balance these two effects. In the vector model, intra-clustering similarity is quantified by measuring the raw frequency of a term ki inside a document d3. Such term frequency is usually referred to as the tf factor and provides one measure of how well that term describes the document contents (i.e., intra-document characterization). Furthermore, inter-cluster dissimilarity is quantified by measuring the inverse of the frequency of a term ki among the documents in the collection. This factor is usually referred to as the inverse document frequency or the idf factor. The motivation for usage of an idf factor is that terms which appear in many documents are not very useful for distinguishing a relevant document from a non-relevant one. As with good clustering algorithms, the most effective term-weighting schemes for IR try to balance these two effects. Definition Let N be the total number of documents in the system and n2 be the number of documents in which the index term ki appears. Let freqij be the raw frequency of term ki in the document dj (i.e., the number of times the term k{ is mentioned in the text of the document dj). Then, the normalized frequency fi,j of term ki in document dj is given by maxi   freqij where the maximum is computed over all terms which are mentioned in the text of the document d3. If the term kt does not appear in the document d3 then fzj = 0. Further, let idfi, inverse document frequency for kt, be given by idf, = log -                                                                                  (2.2) The best known term-weighting schemes use weights which are given by u-1J = /IJxlogó                                                                         (2.3) "I 30        MODELING or by a variation of this formula. Such term-weighting strategies are called tf-idf schemes. Several variations of the above expression for the weight Wij are described in an interesting paper by Salton and Buckley which appeared in 1988 [696]. However, in general, the above expression should provide a good weighting scheme for many collections. For the query term weights, Salton and Buckley suggest :logó                                           (2.4) maxi  freqi^ where freq%A is the raw frequency of the term ki in the text of the information request q. The main advantages of the vector model are: (1) its term-weighting scheme improves retrieval performance; (2) its partial matching strategy allows retrieval of documents that approximate the query conditions; and (3) its cosine ranking formula sorts the documents according to their degree of similarity to the query. Theoretically, the vector model has the disadvantage that index terms are assumed to be mutually independent (equation 2.3 does not account for index term dependencies). However, in practice, consideration of term dependencies might be a disadvantage. Due to the locality of many term dependencies, their indiscriminate application to all the documents in the collection might in fact hurt the overall performance. Despite its simplicity, the vector model is a resilient ranking strategy with general collections. It yields ranked answer sets which are difficult to improve upon without query expansion or relevance feedback (see Chapter 5) within the framework of the vector model. A large variety of alternative ranking methods have been compared to the vector model but the consensus seems to be that, in general, the vector model is either superior or almost as good as the known alternatives. Furthermore, it is simple and fast. For these reasons, the vector model is a popular retrieval model nowadays.
mir-0031	2.5.4    Probabilistic Model In this section, we describe the classic probabilistic model introduced in 1976 by Roberston and Sparck Jones [677] which later became known as the binary independence retrieval (BIR) model.   Our discussion is intentionally brief and focuses mainly on highlighting the key features of the model. With this purpose in mind, we do not detain ourselves in subtleties regarding the binary independence assumption for the model. The section on bibliographic discussion points to references which cover these details. The probabilistic model attempts to capture the IR problem within a probabilistic framework. The fundamental idea is as follows. Given a user query, there is a set of documents which contains exactly the relevant documents and CLASSIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL        31 no other. Let us refer to this set of documents as the ideal answer set. Given the description of this ideal answer set, we would have no problems in retrieving its documents. Thus, we can think of the querying process as a process of specifying the properties of an ideal answer set (which is analogous to interpreting the IR problem as a problem of clustering). The problem is that we do not know exactly what these properties are. All we know is that there are index terms whose semantics should be used to characterize these properties. Since these properties are not known at query time, an effort has to be made at initially guessing what they could be. This initial guess allows us to generate a preliminary probabilistic description of the ideal answer set which is used to retrieve a first set of documents. An interaction with the user is then initiated with the purpose of improving the probabilistic description of the ideal answer set. Such interaction could proceed as follows. The user takes a look at the retrieved documents and decides which ones are relevant and which ones are not (in truth, only the first top documents need to be examined). The system then uses this information to refine the description of the ideal answer set. By repeating this process many times, it is expected that such a description will evolve and become closer to the real description of the ideal answer set. Thus, one should always have in mind the need to guess at the beginning the description of the ideal answer set. Furthermore, a conscious effort is made to model this description in probabilistic terms. The probabilistic model is based on the following fundamental assumption. Assumption (Probabilistic Principle) Given a user query q and a document d3 in the collection, the probabilistic model tries to estimate the probability that the user will find the document d3 interesting (i.e., relevant). The model assumes that this probability of relevance depends on the query and the document representations only. Further, the model assumes that there is a subset of all documents which the user prefers as the answer set for the query q. Such an ideal answer set is labeled R and should maximize the overall probability of relevance to the user. Documents in the set R are predicted to be relevant to the query. Documents not in this set are predicted to be non-relevant This assumption is quite troublesome because it does not state explicitly how to compute the probabilities of relevance. In fact, not even the sample space which is to be used for defining such probabilities is given. Given a query qy the probabilistic model assigns to each document dj, as a measure of its similarity to the query, the ratio P{d3 relevant-to q)/P(d3 non-relevant-to q) which computes the odds of the document d3 being relevant to the query q. Taking the odds of relevance as the rank minimizes the probability of an erroneous judgement [282, 785]. Definition For the probabilistic model, the index term weight variables are all binary i.e., w^j £ {0,1}, Wi,q Ä {0,1}. A query q is a subset of index tenn^ Let R be the set of documents known (or initially guessed) to be relevant Let R be the complement of R (i.e., the set of non-relevant documents). Let P(R\dj) 32        MODELING be the probability that the document dj is relevant to the query q and P(R\dj) be the probability that dj is non-relevant to q. The similarity sim(d3,q) of the document dj to the query q is defined as the ratio Using Bayes' rule, .   ,_     .      P(dj\R)xP{R) stm(d1)q) =       lx__!------ióiP(dj\R)xP(R) P(dj\R) stands for the probability of randomly selecting the document d3 from the set R of relevant documents. Further, P(R) stands for the probability that a document randomly selectedjrom the entire collection is relevant. The meanings attached to P(dj\R) and P(R) are analogous and complementary. Since P(R) and P(R) are the same for all the documents in the collection, we write, sim(dj,q)    -¶ Assuming independence of index terms, sim(dj,q)    ~         *   J P(kl\R) stands for the probability that the index term ki is present in a document randomly selected from the set R. P(ki\R) stands for the probability that the index term ki is not present in a document randomly selected from the set R. The probabilities associated with the set R have meanings which are analogous to the ones just described. Taking logarithms, recalling that P(ki\R) + P(kt\R) = 1, and ignoring factors which are constant for all documents in the context of the same query, we can finally write   which is a key expression for ranking computation in the probabilistic model. Since we do not know the set R at the beginning, it is necessaryjto devise a method for initially computing the probabilities P(k,\R) and P(kt\R). There are many alternatives for such computation. We discuss a couple of them below. CLASSIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL        33 In the very beginning (i.e., immediately after the query specification), there are no retrieved documents. Thus, one has to make simplifying assumptions such as: (a) assume that P(ki\R) is constant for all index terms ki (typically, equal to 0.5) and (b) assume that the distribution of index terms among the non-relevant documents can be approximated by the distribution of index terms among all the documents in the collection. These two assumptions yield P(ki\R)    =    0.5 where, as already denned, m is the number of documents which contain the index term ki and N is the total number of documents in the collection. Given this initial guess, we can then retrieve documents which contain query terms and provide an initial probabilistic ranking for them. After that, this initial ranking is improved as follows. Let V be a subset of the documents initially retrieved and ranked by the probabilistic model Such a subset can be defined, for instance, as the top r ranked documents where r is a previously defined threshold. Further, let V% be the subset of V composed of the documents in V which contain the index term k%. For simplicity, we also use V and Vi to refer to the number of elements in these sets (it should always be clear when the used variable refers to the set or to the number of elements in it). For improving the probabilistic ranking, we need to improve our guesses for P(ki\R) and P(ki\R). This can be accomplished with the following assumptions: (a) we can approximate P(ki\R) by the distribution of the index term ki among the documents retrieved so far, and (b) we can approximate P(ki\R) by considering that all the non-retrieved documents are not relevant. With these assumptions, we can write, This process can then be repeated recursively. By doing so, we are able to improve on our guesses for the probabilities P(ki\R) and P(k{\R) without any assistance from a human subject (contrary to the original idea). However, we can also use assistance from the user for definition of the subset V as originally conceived. The last formulas for P(ki\R) and P(ki\R) pose problems for small values of V and Vz which arise in practice (such as V = 1 and Vt =0). To circumvent these problems, an adjustment factor is often added in which yields R)    =    Vi+∞-5 P(ki\R)   = V + l n% - Vj + 0.5 AT - V + 1 34        MODELING An adjustment factor which is constant and equal to 0.5 is not always satisfactory. An alternative is to take the fraction rii/N as the adjustment factor which yields Rgt;         N-V + l This completes our discussion of the probabilistic model. The main advantage of the probabilistic model, in theory, is that documents are ranked in decreasing order of their probability of being relevant. The disadvantages include: (1) the need to guess the initial separation of documents into relevant and non-relevant sets; (2) the fact that the method does not take into account the frequency with which an index term occurs inside a document (i.e., all weights are binary); and (3) the adoption of the independence assumption for index terms. However, as discussed for the vector model, it is not clear that independence of index terms is a bad assumption in practical situations.
mir-0032	2.5.5    Brief Comparison of Classic Models In general, the Boolean model is considered to be the weakest classic method. Its main problem is the inability to recognize partial matches which frequently leads to poor performance. There is some controversy as to whether the probabilistic model outperforms the vector model. Croft performed some experiments and suggested that the probabilistic model provides a better retrieval performance. However, experiments done afterwards by Salton and Buckley refute that claim. Through several different measures, Salton and Buckley showed that the vector model is expected to outperform the probabilistic model with general collections. This also seems to be the dominant thought among researchers, practitioners, and the Web community, where the popularity of the vector model runs high.
mir-0034	2.6.1    Fuzzy Set Model Representing documents and queries through sets of keywords yields descriptions which are only partially related to the real semantic contents of the respective documents and queries. As a result, the matching of a document to the query terms is approximate (or vague). This can be modeled by considering that each ALTERNATIVE SET THEORETIC MODELS        35 query term defines a fuzzy set and that each document has a degree of membership (usually smaller than 1) in this set. This interpretation of the retrieval process (in terms of concepts from fuzzy theory) is the basic foundation of the various fuzzy set models for information retrieval which have been proposed over the years. Instead of reviewing several of these models here, we focus on a particular one whose description fits well with the models already covered in this chapter. Thus, our discussion is based on the fuzzy set model for information retrieval proposed by Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi [616]. Before proceeding, we briefly introduce some fundamental concepts. Fuzzy Set Theory Fuzzy set theory [846] deals with the representation of classes whose boundaries are not well defined. The key idea is to associate a membership function with the elements of the class. This function takes values in the interval [0,1] with 0 corresponding to no membership in the class and 1 corresponding to full membership. Membership values between 0 and 1 indicate marginal elements of the class. Thus, membership in a fuzzy set is a notion intrinsically gradual instead of abrupt (as in conventional Boolean logic). Definition A fuzzy subset A of a universe of discourse U is characterized by a membership function \±a ' U ó* [0,1] which associates with each element u of U a number ^a{^) in the interval [0,1]. The three most commonly used operations on fuzzy sets are: the complement of a fuzzy set, the union of two or more fuzzy sets, and the intersection of two or more fuzzy sets. They are defined as follows. Definition Let U be the universe of discourse, A and B be two fuzzy subsets of U, and A be the complement of A relative to U. Also, let u be an element of U. Then, Fuzzy sets are useful for representing vagueness and imprecision and have been applied to various domains. In what follows, we discuss their application to information retrieval. Fuzzy Information Retrieval As discussed in Chapters 5 and 7, one additional approach to modeling the information retrieval process is to adopt a thesaurus (which defines terni re36        MODELING lationships). The basic idea is to expand the set of index terms in the query with related terms (obtained from the thesaurus) such that additional relevant documents (i.e., besides the ones which would be normally retrieved) can be retrieved by the user query. A thesaurus can also be used to model the information retrieval problem in terms of fuzzy sets as follows. A thesaurus can be constructed by defining a term-term correlation matrix c (called keyword connection matrix in [616]) whose rows and columns are associated to the index terms in the document collection. In this matrix lt;?, a normalized correlation factor qj between two terms ki and ki can be defined by where rii is the number of documents which contain the term fe$, n\ is the number of documents which contain the term ki, and n^i is the number of documents which contain both terms. Such a correlation metric is quite common and has been used extensively with clustering algorithms as detailed in Chapter 5. We can use the term correlation matrix c to define a fuzzy set associated to each index term fc$. In this fuzzy set, a document dj has a degree of membership HUj computed as ki g d3 which computes an algebraic sum (here implemented as the complement of a negated algebraic product) over all terms in the document dj. A document dj belongs to the fuzzy set associated to the term ki if its own terms are related to ki. Whenever there is at least one index term ki of dj which is strongly related to the index ki (i.e., c^i ~ 1), then /i^j ~ 1 and the index kz is a good fuzzy index for the document dj. In the case when all index terms of dj are only loosely related to ku the index ki is not a good fuzzy index for dj (i.e., \i^j ~ 0). The adoption of an algebraic sum over all terms in the document dj (instead of the classic max function) allows a smooth transition for the values of the \ix j factor. The user states his information need by providing a Boolean-like query expression. As also happens with the classic Boolean model (see the beginning of this chapter), this query is converted to its disjunctive normal form. For instance, the query [q = ka A ( V -ªfcc)] can be written in disjunctive normal form as [qdnf = (1,1,1) V (1,1,0) V (1,0,0)], where each of the components is a binary weighted vector associated to the tuple (ka, h,kc). These binary weighted vectors are the conjunctive components of Qdnf- Let cc% be a reference to the 2-th conjunctive component. Then, Qdnf = CCi    V   CÄ2   V    ...    V   CCp where p is the number of conjunctive components of qdnf-   The procedure to compute the documents relevant to a query is analogous to the procedure adopted ALTERNATIVE SET THEORETIC MODELS        37 A, CC2   + CC3 Figure 2.5    Fuzzy document sets for the query [q = ka  A   (fegt;   V Ä {1,2,3}, is a conjunctive component. Dq is the query fuzzy set. Each I, I by the classic Boolean model. The difference is that here we deal with fuzzy (instead of crispy or Boolean) sets. We proceed with an example. Consider again the query [q = ka A (fe V -ifcc)]. Let Da be the fuzzy set of documents associated to the index ka. This set is composed, for instance, by the documents dj which have a degree of membership /xaj greater than a predefined threshold K. Further, let Da be the complement of the set Da. The fuzzy set Da is associated to kai the negation of the index term ka. Analogously, we can define fuzzy sets D^ and Dc associated to the index terms fc and kC) respectively. Figure 2.5 illustrates this example. Since the sets are all fuzzy, a document dd might belong to the set Da, for instance, even if the text of the document d3 does not mention the index ka. The query fuzzy set Dq is a union of the fuzzy sets associated with the three conjunctive components of qdnf (which are referred to as cci, CC2, and CC3). The membership /iqj of a document dj in the fuzzy answer set Dq is computed as follows. 2=1 =      1 - (I- {laJ^bjVcj) X X (1 - flaJ(l - M6,j where fiij, i Ä {a, h, c}, is the membership of dj in the fuzzy set associated with k%. As already observed, the degree of membership in a disjunctive fuzzy set is computed here using an algebraic sum, instead of the more common max function. Further, the degree of membership in a conjunctive fuzzy set is computed here using an algebraic product, instead of the more common min function. This adoption of algebraic sums and products yields degrees of membership which 38        MODELING vary more smoothly than those computed using the min and max functions and thus seem more appropriate to an information retrieval system. This example illustrates how this fuzzy model ranks documents relative to the user query. The model uses a term-term correlation matrix to compute correlations between a document dj and its fuzzy index terms. Further, the model adopts algebraic sums and products (instead of max and min) to compute the overall degree of membership of a document dj in the fuzzy set defined by the user query. Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi [616] also discuss how to incorporate user relevance feedback into the model but such discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter. Fuzzy set models for information retrieval have been discussed mainly in the literature dedicated to fuzzy theory and are not popular among the information retrieval community. Further, the vast majority of the experiments with fuzzy set models has considered only small collections which make comparisons difficult to make at this time.
mir-0035	2.6.2    Extended Boolean Model Boolean retrieval is simple and elegant. However, since there is no provision for term weighting, no ranking of the answer set is generated. As a result, the size of the output might be too large or too small (see Chapter 10 for details on this issue). Because of these problems, modern information retrieval systems are no longer based on the Boolean model. In fact, most of the new systems adopt at their core some form of vector retrieval. The reasons are that the vector space model is simple, fast, and yields better retrieval performance. One alternative approach though is to extend the Boolean model with the functionality of partial matching and term weighting. This strategy allows one to combine Boolean query formulations with characteristics of the vector model. In what follows, we discuss one of the various models which are based on the idea of extending the Boolean model with features of the vector model. The extended Boolean model, introduced in 1983 by Salton, Fox, and Wu [703], is based on a critique of a basic assumption in Boolean logic as follows. Consider a conjunctive Boolean query given by q ó kx A ky. According to the Boolean model, a document which contains either the term kx or the term ky is as irrelevant as another document which contains neither of them. However, this binary decision criteria frequently is not in accordance with common sense. An analogous reasoning applies when one considers purely disjunctive queries. When only two terms are considered, we can plot queries and documents in a two-dimensional map as shown in Figure 2.6. A document dj is positioned in this space through the adoption of weights wxj and wyj associated with the pairs [kx,dj] and [ky,dj], respectively. We assume that these weights are normalized and thus lie between 0 and 1. For instance, these weights can be computed as normalized tf-idf factors as follows. = /          idf* max,   idf * (0,1) (0,0) ALTERNATIVE SET THEORETIC MODELS        39 (1,1) ky  (1.0)   (0,0)!

For simplicity, in the remainder of this section, we refer to the weight wx^ as x, to the weight wyj as y, and to the document vector d3 = (wx,3,wy,3) as the point dj = (x,y). Observing Figure 2.6 we notice two particularities. First, for a disjunctive query qor ó kxV fcy, the point (0, 0) is the spot to be avoided. This suggests taking the distance from (0,0) as a measure of similarity with regard to the query qor. Second, for a conjunctive query qand = kx A ky, the point (1,1) is the most desirable spot. This suggests taking the complement of the distance from the point (1,1) as a measure of similarity with regard to the query qand-Furthermore, such distances can be normalized which yields, sim(qorid)    = sim(qandid)    =    1If the weights are all Boolean (i.e., wxj £ {0,1}), a document is always positioned in one of the four corners (i.e., (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1)) and the values for sim(qor,d) are restricted to 0, l/\/2, and 1. Analogously, the values for sim(qand,d) are restricted to 0, 1 ó l/\/2, and 1. Given that the number of index terms in a document collection is t, the Boolean model discussed above can be naturally extended to consider Euclidean distances in a t-dimensional space. However, a more comprehensive generalization is to adopt the theory of vector norms as follows. The p-norrn model generalizes the notion of distance to include not only Euclidean distances but also p-distances, where 1 lt; p lt; oc is a newly introduced parameter whose value must be specified at query time. A generalized disjunctive 40        MODELING query is now represented by qor ó a-i   v     A/2   v     ... v   /im Analogously, a generalized conjunctive query is now represented by qand = h  Ap k2 Ap   ... Ap km The respective query-document similarities are now given by t{ + x\ + ... + x m sim{qand)dj)    =    1 - I 771 where each X{ stands for the weight w^d associated to the pair [ki,d3]. The p norm as defined above enjoys a couple of interesting properties as follows. First, when p = 1 it can be verified that .     /           , N           .      /              -, \        Xi   {-          \  X sim(qor,dj) = sim{qand,dj) = Second, when p = oo it can be verified that sim(qor, dj) = sim(qand,d3) = min[xi) Thus, for p = 1, conjunctive and disjunctive queries are evaluated by a sum of term-document weights as done by vector-based similarity formulas (which compute the inner product). Further, for p = oo, queries are evaluated according to the formalism of fuzzy logic (which we view as a generalization of Boolean logic). By varying the parameter p between 1 and infinity, we can vary the p-norm ranking behavior from that of a vector-like ranking to that of a Boolean-like ranking. This is quite powerful and is a good argument in favor of the extended Boolean model. The processing of more general queries is done by grouping the operators in a predefined order. For instance, consider the query q = (fci Ap 2) Vp k%. The similarity sim(q, d3) between a document dj and this query is then computed as /        /                      \ {!-[--------2--------)    )   +x3 [gt;¶-{-------2-------;   ; t4 sim{q,d) = V                                           / This procedure can be applied recursively no matter the number of AND/OR operators. ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        41 One additional interesting aspect of this extended Boolean model is the possibility of using combinations of different values of the parameter p in a same query request. For instance, the query (fci V2 k2) A∞∞ fc3 could be used to indicate that k\ and k2 should be used as in a vector system but that the presence of ks is required (i.e., the conjunction is interpreted as a Boolean operation). Despite the fact that it is not clear whether this additional functionality has any practical impact, the model does allow for it and does so in a natural way (without the need for clumsy extensions to handle special cases). We should also observe that the extended Boolean model relaxes Boolean algebra interpreting Boolean operations in terms of algebraic distances. In this sense, it is really a hybrid model which includes properties of both the set theoretic models and the algebraic models. For simplicity, we opted for classifying the model as a set theoretic one. The extended Boolean model was introduced in 1983 but has not been used extensively. However, the model does provide a neat framework and might reveal itself useful in the future.
mir-0036	2.7    Alternative Algebraic Models In this section, we discuss three alternative algebraic models namely, the generalized vector space model, the latent semantic indexing model, and the neural network model.
mir-0037	2.7.1    Generalized Vector Space Model As already discussed, the three classic models assume independence of index terms. For the vector model, this assumption is normally interpreted as follows. Definition     Let ki be a vector associated with the index term kz. Independence of index terms in the vector model implies thai the set of vectors {k\, k2, kt) is linearly independent and forms a basis for the subspace of interest.   The dimension of this space is the number t of index terms in the collection. Frequently, independence among index terms is interpreted in a more restrictive sense to mean pairwise orthogonality among the index term vectors i.e., to mean that for each pair of index term vectors k% and k3 we have ki ïkJ =0. In 1985, however, Wong, Ziarko, and Wong [832] proposed an interpretation in which the index term vectors are assumed linearly independent but are not pairwise orthogonal. Such interpretation leads to the generalized vector space model which we now discuss. 42        MODELING In the generalized vector space model, two index term vectors might be non-orthogonal. This means that index term vectors are not seen as the orthogonal vectors which compose the basis of the space. Instead, they are themselves composed of smaller components which are derived from the particular collection at hand as follows. Definition Given the set {k\, k2, ..., kt} of index terms in a collection, as before, let Wij be the weight associated with the term-document pair [fc$, dj]. If the Wii3 weights are all binary then all possible patterns of term co-occurrence (inside documents) can be represented by a set of2t minterms given by mi = (0,0,..., 0), rn2 = (1,0,. ..,0)7 ..., m2t = (1,1,. ..,1). Let gi(rrij) return the weight {0,1} of the index term kz in the minterm nrij. Thus, the minterm mi (for which gi(mi) = 0, for all i) points to the documents containing none of the index terms. The minterm m2 (for which gi(m2) = 1, for i = l, and #2(7712) = 0, for i gt; 1) points to the documents containing solely the index term k±. Further, the minterm m2t points to the documents containing all the index terms. The central idea in the generalized vector space model is to introduce a set of pairwise orthogonal vectors rhi associated with the set of minterms and to adopt this set of vectors as the basis for the subspace of interest. Definition     Let us define the following set of rhi vectors fax    =    (1,0,...,0,0) m2    =    (0,1,...,0,0) rh2t    =    (0,0,...,0,1) where each vector rhi is associated with the respective minterm m*. Notice that rhi ï fh3 =0 for all i ¶=£ j and thus the set of rhi vectors is, by definition, pairwise orthogonal. This set of rhi vectors is then taken as the orthonormal basis for the generalized vector space model. Pairwise orthogonality among the rhi vectors does not imply independence among the index terms. On the contrary, index terms are now correlated by the rhi vectors. For instance, the vector rh^ is associated with the minterm m4 = (l,l,...,0) which points to the documents in the collection containing the index terms fcx, k2, and no others. If such documents do exist in the collection under consideration then we say that the minterm m4 is active and that a dependence between the index terms A"i and ^2 is induced. If we consider this point more carefully, we notice that the generalized vector model adopts as a basic foundation the idea that co-occurrence of index terms inside documents in the collection induces dependencies among these index terms. Since this is an idea which was introduced many years before the generalized vector space ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        43 model itself, novelty is not granted. Instead, the main contribution of the model is the establishment of a formal framework in which dependencies among index terms (induced by co-occurrence patterns inside documents) can be nicely represented. The usage of index term dependencies to improve retrieval performance continues to be a controversial issue. In fact, despite the introduction in the 1980s of more effective algorithms for incorporating term dependencies (see Chapter 5), there is no consensus that incorporation of term dependencies in the model yields effective improvement with general collections. Thus, it is not clear that the framework of the generalized vector model provides a clear advantage in practical situations. Further, the generalized vector model is more complex and computationally more expensive than the classic vector model. To determine the index term vector ki associated with the index term ki, we simply sum up the vectors for all minterms mr in which the term kz is in state 1 and normalize. Thus, ft,    = Y Z-^Vr, d3  | 9i(dj)=9i(mr) for all I These equations provide a general definition for the index term vector ki in terms of the mr vectors. The term vector ki collects all the mr vectors in which the index term ki is in state 1. For each rhT vector, a correlation factor a,r is defined. Such a correlation factor sums up the weights Wij associated with the index term ki and each document dj whose term occurrence pattern coincides exactly with that of the minterm mr. Thus, a minterm is of interest (in which case it is said to be active) only if there is at least one document in the collection which matches its term occurrence pattern. This implies that no more than N minterms can be active, where N is the number of documents in the collection. Therefore, the ranking computation does not depend on an exponential number of minterms as equation 2.5 seems to suggest. Notice that the internal product ki ï kj can now be used to quantify a degree of correlation between the index terms ki and kj. For instance, Ki ï Kj ó-                      y                       £i,r ^ ^j,r Vr i 0t(mr) = l A g3{mr)-l which, as later discussed in Chapter 5, is a good technique for quantifying index term correlations. In the classic vector model, a document dj and a user query q are expressed by d3 = J2viwiJ ^ anc* % = Ylviwi,g ^i, respectively. In the generalized vector space model, these representations can be directly translated to the space of minterm vectors mr by applying equation 2.5.  The resultant dj and q vectors 44        MODELING are then used for computing the ranking through a standard cosine similarity function. The ranking that results from the generalized vector space model combines the standard Wij term-document weights with the correlation factors air-However, since the usage of term-term correlations does not necessarily yield improved retrieval performance, it is not clear in which situations the generalized model outperforms the classic vector model. Furthermore, the cost of computing the ranking in the generalized model can be fairly high with large collections because, in this case, the number of active minterms (i.e., those which have to be considered for computing the ki vectors) might be proportional to the number of documents in the collection. Despite these drawbacks, the generalized vector model does introduce new ideas which are of importance from a theoretical point of view.
mir-0038	2.7.2    Latent Semantic Indexing Model As discussed earlier, summarizing the contents of documents and queries through a set of index terms can lead to poor retrieval performance due to two effects. First, many unrelated documents might be included in the answer set. Second, relevant documents which are not indexed by any of the query keywords are not retrieved. The main reason for these two effects is the inherent vagueness associated with a retrieval process which is based on keyword sets. The ideas in a text are more related to the concepts described in it than to the index terms used in its description. Thus, the process of matching documents to a given query could be based on concept matching instead of index term matching. This would allow the retrieval of documents even when they are not indexed by query index terms. For instance, a document could be retrieved because it shares concepts with another document which is relevant to the given query. Latent semantic indexing is an approach introduced in 1988 which addresses these issues (for clustering-based approaches which also address these issues, see Chapter 5). The main idea in the latent semantic indexing model [287] is to map each document and query vector into a lower dimensional space which is associated with concepts. This is accomplished by mapping the index term vectors into this lower dimensional space. The claim is that retrieval in the reduced space may be superior to retrieval in the space of index terms. Before proceeding, let us define basic terminology. Definition    As before, let t he the number of index terms in the collection and N be the total number of documents. Define M=(Mij) as a term-document association matrix with t rows and N columns.   To each element M^  of this matrix is assigned a weight W{^ associated with the term-document pair {kt.dj\. This u\,j weight could be generated using the tf-idf weighting technique common in the classic vector space model ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        45 Latent semantic indexing proposes to decompose the M association matrix in three components using singular value decomposition as follows. M = KSD1 The matrix K is the matrix of eigenvectors derived from the term-to-term correlation matrix given by MM1 (see Chapter 5). The matrix Dl is the matrix of eigenvectors derived from the transpose of the document-to-document matrix given by MlM. The matrix S is an r x r diagonal matrix of singular values where r ó min(t, N) is the rank of M. Consider now that only the s largest singular values of S are kept along with their corresponding columns in K and Dt (i.e., the remaining singular values of 5 are deleted). The resultant Ms matrix is the matrix of rank s which is closest to the original matrix M in the least square sense. This matrix is given by Ms = KsSsDi s where 5, 5 lt; r, is the dimensionality of a reduced concept space. The selection of a value for s attempts to balance two opposing effects. First, s should be large enough to allow fitting all the structure in the real data. Second, s should be small enough to allow filtering out all the non-relevant representational details (which are present in the conventional index-term based representation). The relationship between any two documents in the reduced space of dimensionality 5 can be obtained from the MlMs matrix given by =    (KlS.Dta)tKtSaDta =   DsSsSsDl =    (DsSs)(DsSsy In the above matrix, the (i,j) element quantifies the relationship between documents dx and dj. To rank documents with regard to a given user query, we simply model the query as a pseudo-document in the original M term-document matrix. Assume the query is modeled as the document with number 0. Then, the first row in the matrix MlMs provides the ranks of all documents with respect to this query. Since the matrices used in the latent semantic indexing model are of rank s, s ´t, and s ´ N, they form an efficient indexing scheme for the documents in the collection. Further, they provide for elimination of noise (present in index term-based representations) and removal of redundancy. The latent semantic indexing model introduces an interesting conceptualization of the information retrieval problem based on the theory of singular value decomposition. Thus, it has its value as a new theoretical framework. Whether it is superior in practical situations with general collections remains to be verified. 46 MODELING Query Terms Document Terms Documents Figure 2.7    A neural network model for information retrieval.
mir-0039	2.7.3    Neural Network Model In an information retrieval system, document vectors are compared with query vectors for the computation of a ranking. Thus, index terms in documents and queries have to be matched and weighted for computing this ranking. Since neural networks are known to be good pattern matchers, it is natural to consider their usage as an alternative model for information retrieval. It is now well established that our brain is composed of billions of neurons. Each neuron can be viewed as a basic processing unit which, when stimulated by input signals, might emit output signals as a reactive action. The signals emitted by a neuron are fed into other neurons (through synaptic connections) which can themselves emit new output signals. This process might repeat itself through several layers of neurons and is usually referred to as a spread activation process. As a result, input information is processed (i.e., analyzed and interpreted) which might lead the brain to command physical reactions (e.g., motor actions) in response. A neural network is an oversimplified graph representation of the mesh of interconnected neurons in a human brain. The nodes in this graph are the processing units while the edges play the role of the synaptic connections. To simulate the fact that the strength of a synaptic connection in the human brain changes over time, a weight is assigned to each edge of our neural network. At each instant, the state of a node is defined by its activation level (which is a function of its initial state and of the signals it receives as input). Depending on its activation level, a node A might send a signal to a neighbor node B. The strength of this signal at the node B depends on the weight associated with the edge between the nodes .A and B. A neural network for information retrieval can be defined as illustrated in Figure 2.7. The model depicted here is based on the work in [815]. We first ALTERNATIVE ALGEBRAIC MODELS        47 observe that the neural network in Figure 2.7 is composed of three layers: one for the query terms, one for the document terms, and a third one for the documents themselves. Observe the similarity between the topology of this neural network and the topology of the inference and belief networks depicted in Figures 2.9 and 2.10. Here, however, the query term nodes are the ones which initiate the inference process by sending signals to the document term nodes. Following that, the document term nodes might themselves generate signals to the document nodes. This completes a first phase in which a signal travels from the query term nodes to the document nodes (i.e., from the left to the right in Figure 2.7). The neural network, however, does not stop after the first phase of signal propagation. In fact, the document nodes in their turn might generate new signals which are directed back to the document term nodes (this is the reason for the bidirectional edges between document term nodes and document nodes). Upon receiving this stimulus, the document term nodes might again fire new signals directed to the document nodes, repeating the process. The signals become weaker at each iteration and the spread activation process eventually halts. This process might activate a document di even when such a document does not contain any query terms. Thus, the whole process can be interpreted as the activation of a built-in thesaurus. To the query term nodes is assigned an initial (and fixed) activation level equal to 1 (the maximum). The query term nodes then send signals to the document term nodes which are attenuated by normalized query term weights whq. For a vector-based ranking, these normalized weights can be derived from the weights Wi:q defined for the vector model by equation 2.4. For instance, where the normalization is done using the norm of the query vector. Once the signals reach the document term nodes, these might send new signals out directed towards the document nodes. These signals are attenuated by normalized document term weights Wij derived from the weights Wij defined for the vector model by equation 2.3. For instance, where the normalization is done using the norm of the document vector. The signals which reach a document node are summed up. Thus, after the first round of signal propagation, the activation level of the document node associated to the document dj is given by x /=rt v^i=i 48         MODELING which is exactly the ranking provided by the classic vector model. To improve the retrieval performance, the network continues with the spreading activation process after the first round of propagation. This modifies the initial vector ranking in a process analogous to a user relevance feedback cycle (see Chapter 5). To make the process more effective, a minimum activation threshold might be defined such that document nodes below this threshold send no signals out. Details can be found in [815]. There is no conclusive evidence that a neural network provides superior retrieval performance with general collections. In fact, the model has not been tested extensively with large document collections. However, a neural network does present an alternative modeling paradigm. Further, it naturally allows retrieving documents which are not initially related to the query terms ó an appealing functionality.
mir-0040	2.8    Alternative Probabilistic Models One alternative which has always been considered naturally appealing for quantifying document relevance is the usage of probability theory and its main streams. One such stream which is gaming increased attention concerns the Bayesian belief networks which we now discuss. Bayesian (belief) networks are useful because they provide a clean formalism for combining distinct sources of evidence (past queries, past feedback cycles, and distinct query formulations) in support of the rank for a given document. This combination of distinct evidential sources can be used to improve retrieval performance (i.e., to improve the 'quality' of the ranked list of retrieved documents) as has been demonstrated in the work of Turtle and Croft [771]. In this chapter we discuss two models for information retrieval based on Bayesian networks. The first model is called inference network and provides the theoretical basis for the retrieval engine in the Inquery system [122]. Its success has attracted attention to the use of Bayesian networks with information retrieval systems. The second model is called belief network and generalizes the first model. At the end, we briefly compare the two models. Our discussion below uses a style which is quite distinct from that employed by Turtle and Croft in their original writings. Particularly, we pay more attention to probabilistic argumentation during the development of the model. We make a conscious effort of consistently going back to the Bayesian formalism for motivating the major design decisions. It is our view that such an explanation strategy allows for a more precise argumentation which facilitates the task of grasping the subtleties involved. Before proceeding, we briefly introduce Bayesian networks.
mir-0041	2.8.1    Bayesian Networks Bayesian networks [630] are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in which the nodes represent random variables, the arcs portray causal relationships between these ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS 49 variables, and the strengths of these causal influences are expressed by conditional probabilities. The parents of a node (which is then considered as a child node) are those judged to be direct causes for it. This causal relationship is represented in the DAG by a link directed from each parent node to the child node. The roots of the network are the nodes without parents. Let Xi be a node in a Bayesian network G and Tx% be the set of parent nodes of #$. The influence of Yx% on Xi can be specified by any set of functions Fi(xi,FXl) that satisfy lt;, rSl)   = o  lt;  Fi(xurXt)   lt;   i where X{ also refers to the states of the random variable associated to the node This specification is complete and consistent because the product Y[ii Fi(xi,Tx constitutes a joint probability distribution for the nodes in G. Figure 2.8    An example of a Bayesian network. Figure 2.8 illustrates a Bayesian network for a joint probability distribution P(xi,X2,X3,X4,x5). In this case, the dependencies declared in the network allow the natural expression of the joint probability distribution in terms of local conditional probabilities (a key advantage of Bayesian networks) as follows. The probability P(#i) is called the prior probability for the network and can be used to model previous knowledge about the semantics of the application.
mir-0042	2.8.2    Inference Network Model The two most traditional schools of thought in probability are based on the frequentist view and the epistemological view. The frequentist view takes probability as a statistical notion related to the laws of chance. The epistemological 50 MODELING Figure 2.9    Basic inference network model. view interprets probability as a degree of belief whose specification might be devoid of statistical experimentation. This second viewpoint is important because we frequently refer to probabilities in our daily lives without a clear definition of the statistical experiment which yielded those probabilities. The inference network model [772, 771] takes an epistemological view of the information retrieval problem. It associates random variables with the index terms, the documents, and the user queries. A random variable associated with a document dj represents the event of observing that document (i.e., the model assumes that documents are being observed in the search for relevant documents). The observation of the document dj asserts a belief upon the random variables associated with its index terms. Thus, observation of a document is the cause for an increased belief in the variables associated with its index terms. Index term and document variables are represented as nodes in the network. Edges are directed from a document node to its term nodes to indicate that observation of the document yields improved belief on its term nodes. The random variable associated with the user query models the event that the information request specified by the query has been met. This random variable is also represented by a node in the network. The belief in this (query) node is a function of the beliefs in the nodes associated with the query terms. Thus, edges are directed from the index term nodes to the query node. Figure 2.9 illustrates an inference network for information retrieval. The document d3 has A?2, kii and kt as its index terms. This is modeled by directing the edges from the node d3 to the nodes 2, k^ and kt. The query q is composed of the index terms k\, 2, and fcj. This is modeled by directing the edges from the nodes k\% 2* and k{ to the node q. Notice that Figure 2.9 also includes three extra nodes: Q2, #1, and /. The nodes $2 and qi are used to model an (alternative) Boolean formulation qj for the query q (in this case, q\ = (k\ A klt;i) V kt).  When such ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS        51 (additional) information is available, the user information need / is supported by both q and q\. In what follows, we concentrate our attention on the support provided to the query node q by the observation of a document d3. Later on, we discuss the impact of considering multiple query representations for an information need /. This is important because, as Turtle and Croft have demonstrated, a keyword-based query formulation (such as q) can be combined with a Boolean-like query formulation (such as q{) to yield improved retrieval performance for the same information need. The complete inference network model also includes text nodes and query concept nodes but the model discussed above summarizes the essence of the approach. A simplifying assumption is made which states that all random variables in the network are binary. This seems arbitrary but it does simplify the modeling task and is general enough to capture all the important relationships in the information retrieval problem. Definition Let k be a t-dimensional vector defined by k = (i, 2, ï ï ï ,kt) where k\, k2, ..., kt are binary random variables i.e., k% Ä {0,1}. These variables define the 2l possible states for k. Further, let d3 be a binary random variable associated with a document dj and let q be a binary random variable associated with the user query. Notice that q is used to refer to the query, to the random variable associated with it, and to the respective node in the network. This is also the case for dj and for each index term ki. We allow this overloading in syntax because it should always be clear whether we are referring to either the query or to its associated random variable. The ranking of a document dj with respect to a query q is a measure of how much evidential support the observation of dj provides to the query q. In an inference network, the ranking of a document dj is computed as P(q A dj) where q and d3 are short representations for q = 1 and dj = 1, respectively. In general, such a ranking is given by Vfc  VA: P(qAdj)    =    l-P(qAdj) 52        MODELING which is obtained by basic conditioning and the application of Bayes' rule. Notice that P{q\dj x k) = P(q\k) because the ki nodes separate the query node q from the document node d3.  Also, the notation q A dj is a short representation for The instantiation of a document node d3 (i.e., the observation of the document) separates its children index term nodes making them mutually independent (see Bayesian theory for details). Thus, the degree of belief asserted to each index term node ki by instantiating the document node dj can be computed separately. This implies that P(k\d3) can be computed in product form which yields (from equation 2.6), P(q/\dj)    =    TP(q\k)x P{k%\dj) ] x P(d3)      (2.7) P{q/\d3)    =    l-P(q/\dj where P{ki\d3) = 1 -P{kl\d3). Through proper specification of the probabilities P(q\k)i P(kt\dj), and P(dj), we can make the inference network cover a wide range of useful information retrieval ranking strategies. Later on, we discuss how to use an inference network to subsume the Boolean model and tf-idf ranking schemes. Let us first cover the specification of the P(d3) probabilities. Prior Probabilities for Inference Networks Since the document nodes are the root nodes in an inference network, they receive a prior probability distribution which is of our choosing. This prior probability reflects the probability associated to the event of observing a given document dj (to simplify matters, a single document node is observed at a time). Since we have no prior preferences for any document in particular, we usually adopt a prior probability distribution which is uniform. For instance, in the original work on inference networks [772, 771], the probability of observing a document d3 is set to l/N where N is the total number of documents in the system. Thus, The choice of the value 1/Ar for the prior probability P{dj) is a simple and natural specification given that our collection is composed of N documents. However, other specifications for P(d3) might also be interesting. For instance, in the cosine formula of the vector model, the contribution of an index term to ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS        53 the rank of the document d3 is inversely proportional to the norm of the vector dj. The larger the norm of the document vector, the smaller is the relative contribution of its index terms to the document final rank. This effect can be taken into account through proper specification of the prior probabilities P(dj) as follows. =   \-P{d3) where \d3 | stands for the norm of the vector d3. Therefore, in this case, the larger the norm of a document vector, the smaller its associated prior probability. Such specification reflects a prior knowledge that we have about the behavior of vector-based ranking strategies (which normalize the ranking in the document space). As commanded by Bayesian postulates, previous knowledge of the application domain should be asserted in the specification of the priors in the network, as we have just done. Inference Network for the Boolean Model Here we demonstrate how an inference network can be tuned to subsume the Boolean model. First, for the Boolean model, the prior probabilities P{d3) are all set to I/AT because the Boolean model makes no prior distinction on documents. Thus, p(d3) = i Regarding the conditional probabilities P(ki\dj) and P(q\k), the specification is as follows. 0    otherwise P(kt\dj)    =    l-Pihldj) which basically states that, when the document dj is being observed, only the nodes associated with the index terms of the document dj are active (i.e., have an induced probability greater than 0). For instance, observation of a document node dj whose term vector is composed of exactly the index terms A:2, kt, and kt (see Figure 2.9) activates the index term nodes {k2,kt,kt} and no others. Once the beliefs in the index term nodes have been computed, we can use them to compute the evidential support they provide to the user query q as 54        MODELING follows. P(q\k)    =    /  1    if 3$ô   I   (Qcc Ä qdnf) A(Vfct, 9i{k) = gi(qcc)) 1  ;          \ 0    otherwise P{q\k)    =    1-P(lt;?|fc) where qcc and gdn/ are as defined for the classic Boolean model. The above equation basically states that one of the conjunctive components of the user query (expressed in disjunctive normal form) must be matched by the set of active terms in k (in this case, those activated by the document observed) exactly. Substituting the above definitions for P(q\h), P(ki\dj), and P(dj) into equation 2.7, it can be easily shown that the set of documents retrieved is exactly the set of documents returned by the Boolean model as defined in section 2.5.2. Thus, an inference network can be used to subsume the Boolean model without difficulties. Inference Network for tf-idf Ranking Strategies For tf-idf ranking strategies (i.e., those related to the vector model), we adopt prior probabilities which reflect our prior knowledge of the importance of document normalization. Thus, we set the prior P(dj) to l/|dj| as follows. P(dj)    =    -1-                                                                     (2.8) P(dj)    =    1 Further, we have to decide where to introduce the tf (term-frequency) and the idf (inverse-document-frequency) factors in the network. For that purpose, we consider that the tf and idf factors are normalized (as in equation 2.1) and that these normalized factors are strictly smaller than 1. We first focus on capturing the impact of the tf factors in the network. Normalized tf factors are taken into account through the beliefs asserted upon the index term nodes as follows. P(ki\dj)    =   fij                                                                   (2.9) These equations simply state that, according to the observed document dj, the relevance of a term hi is determined by its normalized term-frequency factor. We are now in a position to consider the influence of idf factors. They are taken into account through the specification of the impact of index term nodes ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS        55 on the query node. Define a vector ki given by, ki=k  \   (9i(k) = 1 A V^ 9j{%) = 0) The vector k% is a reference to the state of the vector k in which the node ki is active and all others are inactive. The motivation is that tf-idf ranking strategies sum up the individual contributions of index terms and ki allows us to consider the influence of the term ki in isolation. We are now ready to define the influence of the index term nodes in the query node q as _    I idfi    if  k = hA gi(q) = 1                                     ( "   \ o     if j^£vft($) = o                                 (2*10) P(q\k)    =    1-P(q\k) where idfz here is a normalized version of the idf factor defined in equation 2.2. By applying equations 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 to equation 2.7, we can then write JJ x ói P{ds) I =    f IJPCJfeil^) ) x P{dj) x Y^p(ki\di) x __         I   '       y    _____    V                          \                             T ¶         V   1 /7 T      V    óóóóóóóó        Ky t   A       15       lt;*ª                          7                             11   1   A   6Ci/ 2   ^ Mjl       Vt      rf- ~^A    (g=1                        1~^J =    l-PfgAd,-) which provides a tf-idf-like ranking. Unfortunately, Cj depends on a product of the various probabilities P(ki\dj) which vary from document to document and thus the ranking is distinct from the one provided by the vector model. Despite this peculiarity in the tf-idf ranking generated, it has been shown that an inference network is able to provide good retrieval performance with general collections. The reason is that the network allows us to consistently combine evidence from distinct evidential sources to improve the final ranking, as we now discuss. Combining Evidential Sources In Figure 2.9, the first query node q is the standard keyword-based query formulation for the user information need /. The second query q\ is a Boolean-iike query formulation for the same information need (i.e., an additional evidential source collected from a specialist). The joint support these two query formulations provide to the information need node / can be modeled through, for 56        MODELING instance, an OR operator (i.e., / = q V qi). In this case, the ranking provided by the inference network is computed as, P(I A dj)    =   ^2 PCW x p(k\do) x p(ds) k =    X^1 ~ P(5l*) P(^)) x P(^ldi) x P(^) k which might yield a retrieval performance which surpasses the retrieval performance obtained with each of the query nodes in isolation as demonstrated in [771].
mir-0043	2.8.3    Belief Network Model The belief network model, introduced in 1996 by Ribeiro-Neto and Muntz [674], is also based on an epistemological interpretation of probabilities. However, it departs from the inference network model by adopting a clearly defined sample space. As a result, it yields a slightly different network topology which provides a separation between the document and the query portions of the network. This is the main difference between the two models and one which has theoretical implications. The Probability Space The probability space adopted was first introduced by Wong and Yao [830] and works as follows. All documents in the collection are indexed by index terms and the universe of discourse U is the set K of all index terms. Definition The set K = {i,..., kt} is the universe of discourse and defines the sample space for the belief network model Let u C K be a subset of K. To each subset u is associated a vector k such that gi(k) = 1 4=$- ki Ä u. The introduction of the vector k is useful to keep the notation compatible with the one which has been used throughout this chapter. Each index term is viewed as an elementary concept and AT as a concept space.   A concept u is a subset of K and might represent a document in the collection or a user query.   In a belief network, set relationships are specified using random variables as follows. Definition    7b each index term k% is associated a binary random variable which is also referred to as ki. The random variable kt is set to 1 to indicate that the index k% is a member of a concept/set represented by k. ALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS        57 This association of concepts with subsets is useful because it allows us to express the logical notions of conjunction, disjunction, negation, and implication as the more familiar set-theoretic notions of intersection, union, complementation, and inclusion. Documents and user queries can be defined as concepts in the sample space K as follows. Definition A document d3 in the collection is represented as a concept (i.e., a set) composed of the terms which are used to index dj. Analogously, a user query q is represented as a concept composed of the terms which are used to index q. A probability distribution P is defined over K as follows. Let c be a generic concept in the space K representing a document or user query. Then, P(c)    =    ^P(c|w)xP(U)                                                         (2.11) P(u)    =    ^- 1                                                                            (2.12) Equation 2.11 defines P(c) as the degree of coverage of the space K by c. Such a coverage is computed by contrasting each of the concepts in K with c (through P(c\u)) and by summing up the individual contributions. This sum is weighted by the probability P{u) with which u occurs in K. Since at the beginning the system has no knowledge of the probability with which a concept u occurs in the space K, we can assume that each u is equally likely which results in equation 2.12. Belief Network Model In the belief network model, the user query q is modeled as a network node to which is associated a binary random variable (as in the inference network model) which is also referred to as q. This variable is set to 1 whenever q completely covers the concept space K. Thus, when we assess P(q) we compute the degree of coverage of the space K by q. This is equivalent to assessing the degree of belief associated with the following proposition: Is it true that q completely covers all possible concepts in K? A document d3 is modeled as a network node with which is associated a binary random variable which is also referred to as d3. This variable is 1 to indicate that dj completely covers the concept space A". When we assess P(dj)% we compute the degree of coverage of the space K by dj. This is equivalent to assessing the degree of belief associated with the following proposition: Is it true that dj completely covers all possible concepts in K? According to the above formalism, the user query and the documents in the collection are modeled as subsets of index terms. Each of these subsets is interpreted as a concept embedded in the concept space K which works as a common sample space.   Furthermore, user queries and documents are modeled 58 MODELING Figure 2.10   Basic belief network model. identically. This is an important observation because it defines the topology of the belief network. Figure 2.10 illustrates our belief network model. As in the inference network model, a query q is modeled as a binary random variable which is pointed to by the index term nodes which compose the query concept. Documents are treated analogously to user queries (i.e., both are concepts in the space K). Thus, contrary to the inference network model, a document node is pointed to by the index term nodes which compose the document. This is the topological difference between the two models and one which has more implications than it seems at first glance. The ranking of a document dj relative to a given query q is interpreted as a concept matching relationship and reflects the degree of coverage provided to the concept dj by the concept q. Assumption In the belief network model, P(dj\q) is adopted as the rank of the document dj with respect to the query q. By the application of Bayes' theorem, we can write P{d3\q) = P(d3 A q)/P(q). Since P(q) is a constant for all documents in the collection, we can write P(dj\q) ~ P(dj A q) i.e., the rank assigned to a document dj is directly proportional to P(dj A q). This last probability is computed through the application of equation 2.11 which yields P(dj\q) In the belief network of Figure 2.10, instantiation of the index term variables logically separates the nodes q and d making them mutually independent (i.e., the document and query portions of the network are logically separated by inALTERNATIVE PROBABILISTIC MODELS stantiation of the index term nodes). Therefore, 59 which can be rewritten as P(k) (2.13) Vfc To complete the belief network we need to specify the conditional probabilities P(q\k) and P(dj\k). Distinct specifications of these probabilities allow the modeling of different ranking strategies (corresponding to different IR models). We now discuss how to specify these probabilities to subsume the vector model. For the vector model, the probabilities P{q\k) and P(d3\k) are specified as follows. Let, hi = k  |   (#(*?) = 1 A as before. Also, P(q\k)    = 0 9j(k)=0) if k = h A gt(q) = 1 otherwise P(q\k)    =    1-P(q\k) Further, define 0 P(dj\k)    =    1-P(dj\k) if k = ki A 9i(dj) = 1 otherwise Then, the ordering of the retrieved documents (i.e., the ranking) defined by P(dj\q) coincides with the ordering generated by the vector model as specified in section 2.5.3. Thus, the belief network model can be tuned to subsume the vector model which cannot be accomplished with the inference network model.
mir-0044	2.8.4    Comparison of Bayesian Network Models There is a close resemblance between the belief network model and the inference network model. However, this resemblance hides important differences between the two models. First, the belief network model is based on a set-theoretic view 60        MODELING of the IR ranking problem and adopts a clearly defined sample space. The inference network model takes a purely epistemological view of the IR problem which is more difficult to grasp (because, for instance, the sample space is not clearly defined). Second, the belief network model provides a separation between the document and the query portions of the network which facilitates the modeling of additional evidential sources such as past queries and past relevance information. Third, as a result of this document-query space separation, the belief network model is able to reproduce any ranking strategy generated by the inference network model while the converse is not true. To see that the belief network ranking subsumes any ranking generated by an inference network, compare equations 2.6 and 2.13. The key distinction is between the terms P(d3\k) and P(k\d3). For the latter, instantiation of the document node dj separates the index term nodes making them mutually independent. Thus, the joint probability P(k\d3) can always be computed as the product of the individual probabilities P(kl\dj). However, the computation of P(dj\k) might be non-decomposable in a product of term-based probabilities. As a result, P(d3\k) can express any probability function denned with P{k\d3) while the converse is not true. One should not infer from the above comparison that the inference network model is not a good model. On the contrary, it has been shown in the literature that the inference network model allows top retrieval performance to be accomplished with general collections. Further, it is the retrieval model used by the Inquery system. The point of the comparison is that, from a theoretical point of view, the belief network model is more general. Also, it provides a separation between the document space and the query space which simplifies the modeling task.
mir-0045	2.8.5    Computational Costs of Bayesian Networks In the inference network model, according to equation 2.6, only the states which have a single document active node are considered. Thus, the cost of computing the ranking is linear on the number of documents in the collection. As with conventional collections, index structures such as inverted files (see Chapter 8) are used to restrict the ranking computation to those documents which have terms in common with the query. Thus, the cost of computing an inference network ranking has the same complexity as the cost of computing a vectorial ranking. In the belief network model, according to equation 2.13, the only states (of the roots nodes) considered (for computing the rank of a document d3) are the ones in which the active nodes are exactly those associated with the query terms. Thus, again, the cost of computing the ranking is linear on the number of documents in the collection. If index structures are used, the cost of computing a belief network ranking has the same complexity as the cost of computing a vectorial ranking. STRUCTURED TEXT RETRIEVAL MODELS        61 Therefore, the Bayesian network models discussed here do not impose significant additional costs for ranking computation. This is so because the networks presented do not include cycles, which implies that belief propagation can be done in a time proportional to the number of nodes in the network.
mir-0046	2.8.6    The Impact of Bayesian Network Models The classic Boolean model is based on a neat formalism but is not very effective for information retrieval. The classic vector model provides improved answer sets but lacks a more formal framework. Many attempts have been made in the past to combine the best features of each model. The extended Boolean model and the generalized vector space model are two well known examples. These past attempts are grounded in the belief that the combination of selected properties from distinct models is a promising approach towards improved retrieval. Bayesian network models constitute modern variants of probabilistic reasoning whose major strength (for information retrieval) is a framework which allows the neat combination of distinct evidential sources to support a relevance judgement (i.e., a numerical rank) on a given document. In this regard, belief networks seem more appropriate than previous approaches and more promising. Further, besides allowing the combination of Boolean and vector features, a belief network can be naturally extended to incorporate evidential information derived from past user sessions [674] and feedback cycles [332]. The inference network model has been successfully implemented in the Inquery retrieval system [122] and compares favorably with other retrieval systems. However, despite these promises, whether Bayesian networks will become popular and widely used for information retrieval remains to be seen.
mir-0047	2.9    Structured Text Retrieval Models Consider a user with a superior visual memory. Such a user might then recall that the specific document he is interested in contains a page in which the string 'atomic holocaust appears in italic in the text surrounding a Figure whose label contains the word 'earth.' With a classic information retrieval model, this query could be expressed as ['atomic holocaust' and 'earth'] which retrieves all the documents containing both strings. Clearly, however, this answer contains many more documents than desired by this user. In this particular case, the user would like to express his query through a richer expression such as same-page (near ("atomic holocausts Figure (label ("earth')))) which conveys the details in his visual recollection. Further, the user might be interested in an advanced interface which simplifies the task of specifying this (now complex) query. This example illustrates the appeal of a query language which allows us to combine the specification of strings (or patterns) with the 62        MODELING specification of structural components of the document. Retrieval models which combine information on text content with information on the document structure are called structured text retrieval models. For a query such as the one illustrated above, a structured text retrieval system searches for all the documents which satisfy the query. Thus, there is no notion of relevance attached to the retrieval task. In this sense, the current structured text retrieval models are data (instead of information) retrieval models. However, the retrieval system could search for documents which match the query conditions only partially. In this situation, the matching would be approximate and some ranking would have to be used for ordering the approximate answers. Thus, a structured text retrieval algorithm can be seen as an information retrieval algorithm for which the issue of appropriate ranking is not well established. In fact, this is an actual, interesting, and open research problem. At the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, various structured text retrieval models have appeared in the literature. Usually, the more expressive the model, the less efficient is its query evaluation strategy. Thus, selection of a structured model for a given application must be exercised with care. A good policy is to select the most efficient model which supports the functionality required by the application in view. Here, we do not survey all the structured text retrieval models. Instead, we briefly discuss the main features of two of them, namely, a model based on non-overlapping lists and a model based on proximal nodes. These two models should provide a good overview of the main issues and tradeoffs in structured text retrieval. We use the term match point to refer to the position in the text of a sequence of words which matches (or satisfies) the user query. Thus, if the user specifies the simple query ['atomic holocaust in Hiroshima'] and this string appears in three positions in the text of a document dj, we say that the document dj contains three match points. Further, we use the term region to refer to a contiguous portion of the text and the term node to refer to a structural component of the document such as a chapter, a section, a subsection, etc. Thus, a node is a region with predefined topological properties which are known both to the author of the document and to the user who searches the document system.
mir-0048	2.9.1    Mode! Based on Non-Overlapping Lists Burkowski [132, 133] proposes to divide the whole text of each document in non-overlapping text regions which are collected in a list Since there are multiple ways to divide a text in non-overlapping regions, multiple lists are generated. For instance, we might have a list of all chapters in the document, a second list of all sections in the document, and a third list of all subsections in the document. These lists are kept as separate and distinct data structures. While the text regions in the same (flat) list have no overlapping, text regions from distinct lists might overlap. Figure 2.11 illustrates four separate lists for the same document. STRUCTURED TEXT RETRIEVAL MODELS        63  Chapter Ñ Sections Subsections Subsubsections Figure 2.11    Representation of the structure in the text of a document through four separate (flat) indexing lists. To allow searching for index terms and for text regions, a single inverted file (see Chapter 8 for a definition of inverted files) is built in which each structural component stands as an entry in the index. Associated with each entry, there is a list of text regions as a list of occurrences. Moreover, such a list could be easily merged with the traditional inverted file for the words in the text. Since the text regions are non-overlapping, the types of queries which can be asked are simple: (a) select a region which contains a given word (and does not contain other regions); (b) select a region A which does not contain any other region B (where B belongs to a list distinct from the list for A); (c) select a region not contained within any other region, etc.
mir-0049	2.9.2    Model Based on Proximal Nodes Navarro and Baeza-Yates [41, 589, 590] propose a model which allows the definition of independent hierarchical (non-flat) indexing structures over the same document text. Each of these indexing structures is a strict hierarchy composed of chapters, sections, paragraphs, pages, and lines which are called nodes (see Figure 2.12). To each of these nodes is associated a text region. Further, two distinct hierarchies might refer to overlapping text regions. Given a user query which refers to distinct hierarchies, the compiled answer is formed by nodes which all come from only one of them. Thus, an answer cannot be composed of nodes which come from two distinct hierarchies (which allows for faster query processing at the expense of less expressiveness). Notice, however, that due to the hierarchical structure, nested text regions (coming from the same hierarchy) are allowed in the answer set. Figure 2.12 illustrates a hierarchical indexing structure composed of four 64        MODELING -ï    Chapter Sections Subsections Subsubsections Figure 2.12    Hierarchical index for structural components and flat index for words. levels (corresponding to a chapter, sections, subsections, and subsubsections of the same document) and an inverted list for the word 'holocaust.' The entries in this inverted list indicate all the positions in the text of the document in which the word 'holocaust' occurs. In the hierarchy, each node indicates the position in the text of its associated structural component (chapter, section, subsection, or subsubsection). The query language allows the specification of regular expressions (to search for strings), the reference to structural components by name (to search for chapters, for instance), and a combination of these. In this sense, the model can be viewed as a compromise between expressiveness and efficiency. The somewhat limited expressiveness of the query language allows efficient query processing by first searching for the components which match the strings specified in the query and, subsequently, evaluating which of these components satisfy the structural part of the query. Consider, for instance, the query [(*section) with ('holocaust')] which searches for sections, subsections, or subsubsections which contain the word 'holocaust.7 A simple query processing strategy is to traverse the inverted list for the term 'holocaust1 and, for each entry in the list (which indicates an occurrence of the term 'holocaust' in the text), search the hierarchical index looking for sections, subsections, and subsubsections containing that occurrence of the term. A more sophisticated query processing strategy is as follows. For the first entry in the list for "holocaust,1 search the hierarchical index as before. This implies traversing down the hierarchy until no more successful matches occur (or the bottom of the hierarchy is reached). Let the last matching structural component be referred to as the innermost matching component. Once this first search is concluded, do not start ail over again for the following entry in the MODELS FOR BROWSING        65 inverted list. Instead, verify whether the innermost matching component also matches the second entry in the list. If it does, we immediately conclude that the larger structural components above it (in the hierarchy) also do. Proceed then to the third entry in the list, and so on. Notice that the query processing is accelerated because only the nearby (or proximal) nodes in the list need to be searched at each time. This is the reason for the label proximal nodes. The model based on proximal nodes allows us to formulate queries which are more complex than those which can be formulated in the model based on non-overlapping lists. To speed up query processing, however, only nearby (proximal) nodes are looked at which imposes restrictions on the answer set retrieved (all nodes must come from the same hierarchy). More complex models for structured retrieval have been proposed in the literature as discussed in [41, 590].
mir-0050	2.10    Models for Browsing As already observed, the user might not be interested in posing a specific query to the system. Instead, he might be willing to invest some time in exploring the document space looking for interesting references. In this situation, we say that the user is browsing the space instead of searching. Both with browsing and searching, the user has goals which he is pursuing. However, in general, the goal of a searching task is clearer in the mind of the user than the goal of a browsing task. As is obvious, this is not a distinction which is valid in all scenarios. But, since it is simple and provides a clear separation between the tasks of searching and browsing, it is adopted here. We distinguish three types of browsing namely, flat, structure guided, and hypertext.
mir-0051	The idea here is that the user explores a document space which has a flat organization. For instance, the documents might be represented as dots in a (two-dimensional) plan or as elements in a (single dimension) list. The user then glances here and there looking for information within the documents visited. For instance, he might look for correlations among neighbor documents or for keywords which are of interest to Mm. Such keywords could then be added to the original query in an attempt to provide better contextualization. This is a process called relevance feedback which is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Also, the user could explore a single document in a flat manner. For example, he could use a browser to look into a Web page, using the arrows and the scroll bar. One disadvantage is that in a given page or screen there may not be any indication about the context where the user is. For example, if he opens a novel at a random page, he might not know in which chapter that page is. Web search engines such as "Yahoo!1 provide, besides the standard search interface, a hierarchical directory which can be used for browsing (and frequently, for searching). However, the organization is not flat as discussed below. 66        MODELING
mir-0052	2.10.2    Structure Guided Browsing To facilitate the task of browsing, the documents might be organized in a structure such as a directory. Directories are hierarchies of classes which group documents covering related topics. Such hierarchies of classes have been used to classify document collections for many centuries now. Thus, it seems natural to adapt them for use with modern browsing interfaces. In this case, we say that the user performs a structure guided type of browsing. The same idea can be applied to a single document. For example, if we are browsing an electronic book, a first level of content could be the chapters, the second level, all sections, and so on. The last level would be the text itself (flat). A good user interface could go down or up those levels in a focused manner, assisting the user with the task of keeping track of the context. Besides the structure which directs the browsing task, the interface can also include facilities such as a history map which identifies classes recently visited. This might be quite useful for dealing with very large structures - an issue discussed in Chapters 10 and 13. When searching, the occurrences can also be displayed showing just the structure (for example, using the table of contents). This allows us to see the occurrences in a global context instead of in a page of text that may have no indication of wThere we are.
mir-0053	2.10.3    The Hypertext Model One fundamental concept related to the task of writing down text is the notion of sequencing. Written text is usually conceived to be read sequentially. The reader should not expect to fully understand the message conveyed by the writer by randomly reading pieces of text here and there. One might rely on the text structure to skip portions of the text but this might result in miscommunication between reader and writer. Thus, a sequenced organizational structure lies underneath most written text. When the reader fails to perceive such a structure and abide by it, he frequently is unable to capture the essence of the writer's message. Sometimes, however, we are looking for information which is subsumed by the whole text but which cannot be easily captured through sequential reading. For instance, while glancing at a book about the history of the wars fought by man, we might be momentarily interested solely in the regional wars in Europe. We know that this information is in the book, but we might have a hard time finding it because the writer did not organize his writings with this purpose (he might have organized the wars chronologically). In such a situation, a different organization of the text is desired. However, there is no point in rewriting the whole text. Thus, the solution is to define a new organizational structure besides the one already in existence. One way to accomplish such a goal is through the design of a hypertext. MODELS FOR BROWSING        67 Hypertext Definition and the Navigational Task A hypertext is a high level interactive navigational structure which allows us to browse text non-sequentially on a computer screen. It consists basically of nodes which are correlated by directed links in a graph structure. To each node is associated a text region which might be a chapter in a book, a section in an article, or a Web page. Two nodes A and B might be connected by a directed link Iab which correlates the texts associated with these two nodes. In this case, the reader might move to the node B while reading the text associated with the node A. In its most conventional form, a hypertext link Iab is attached to a specific string inside the text for node A. Such a string is marked specially (for instance, its characters might appear in a different color or underlined) to indicate the presence of the underlying link. While reading the text, the user might come across a marked string. If the user clicks on that string, the underlying directed link is followed, and a new text region (associated with the node at the destination) is displayed on the screen. The process of navigating the hypertext can be understood as a traversal of a directed graph. The linked nodes of the graph represent text nodes which are semantically related. While traversing this graph the reader visualizes a flow of information which was conceived by the designer of the hypertext. Consider our previous example regarding a book on the wars fought by man. One might design a hypertext composed of two distinct webs (here, a web is simply a connected component formed by a subset of all links in the hypertext). While the first web might be designed to provide access to the local wars fought in Europe in chronological order, the second web might be designed to provide access to the local wars fought by each European country. In this way, the user of this hypertext can access the information according to his particular need. When the hypertext is large, the user might lose track of the organizational structure of the hypertext. The effect is that the user might start to take bad navigational decisions which might sidetrack him from his main goal (which usually consists of finding a piece of information in the hypertext). When this happens, the user is said to be lost in hyperspace [604]. To avoid this problem, it is desirable that the hypertext include a hypertext map which shows where the user is at all times. In its simplest form, this map is a directed graph which displays the current node being visited. Additionally, such a map could include information on the paths the user has traveled so far. This can be used to remind the user of the uselessness of following paths which have been explored already. While navigating a hypertext, the user is restricted to the intended flow of information previously conceived by the hypertext designer. Thus, the task of designing a hypertext should take into account the needs of its potential users. This implies the execution of a requirement analysis phase before starting the actual implementation of the hypertext. Such a requirement analysis is critically important but is frequently overlooked. Furthermore, during the hypertext navigation, the user might find it difficult to orient himself. This difficulty arises even in the presence of a guiding 68        MODELING tool such as the hypertext map discussed above. One possible reason is an excessively complex hypertext organization with too many links which allow the user to travel back and forth. To avoid this problem, the hypertext can have a simpler structure which can be quickly remembered by the user at all times. For instance, the hypertext can be organized hierarchically to facilitate the navigational task. Definition of the structure of the hypertext should be accomplished in a domain modeling phase (done after a requirement analysis phase). Further, after the modeling of the domain, a user interface design should be concluded prior to implementation. Only then, can we say that we have a proper hypertext structure for the application at hand. In the Web, however, pages are usually implemented with no attention paid to requirement analysis, domain modeling, and user interface design. As a result, Web pages are frequently poorly conceived and often fail to provide the user with a proper hypertext structure for assistance with the information seeking task. With large hypertexts, it might be difficult for the user to position himself in the part of the whole graph which is of most interest to him. To facilitate this initial positioning step, a search based on index terms might be used. In [540], Manber discusses the advantages of this approach. Hypertexts provided the basis for the conception and design of the hypertext markup language (HTML) and the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) which originated the World Wide Web (which we simply refer to as the Web). In Chapter 13, we discuss the Web in detail. We briefly discuss some of its features below. About the Web When one talks about the Web, the first concept which comes to mind is that of a hypertext. In fact, we frequently think of the WTeb as a huge distributed hypertext domain. However, the Web is not exactly a proper hypertext because it lacks an underlying data model, it lacks a navigational plan, and it lacks a consistently designed user interface. Each one of the millions of Web page designers devises his own interface with its own peculiar characteristics. Many times we visit a Web site simply looking for a phone number and cannot find it because it is buried in the least expected place of the local hypertext structure. Thus, the Web user has no underlying metaphor to assist him in the search for information of interest. Instead of saying that the Web is a hypertext, we prefer to say that it is a pool of (partially) interconnected webs. Some of these webs might be characterized as a local hypertext (in the sense that they have an underlying structure which enjoys some consistency) but others might be simply a collection of pages designed separately (for instance, the web of a university department whose professors design their own pages). Despite not being exactly a hypertext, the Web has provided us with a new dimension in communication functionality because it is easily accessible world wide at very low cost. And maybe most important, the Web has no control body setting up regulations and censorship rules. As a BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        69 result, for the first time in the history of mankind, any one person can publish his writings through a large medium without being subjected to the filtering of an editorial board. For a more thorough discussion of these and many other issues related to the Web, the user is referred to Chapter 13.
mir-0054	2.11    Trends and Research issues There are three main types of products and systems which can benefit directly from research in models for information retrieval: library systems, specialized retrieval systems, and the Web. Regarding library systems, there is currently much interest in cognitive and behavioral issues oriented particularly at a better understanding of which criteria the users adopt to judge relevance. Prom the point of view of the computer scientist, a main question is how this knowledge about the user affects the ranking strategies and the user interface implemented by the system. A related issue is the investigation of how models other than the Boolean model (which is still largely adopted by most large commercial library systems) affect the user of a library. A specialized retrieval system is one which is developed with a particular application in mind. For instance, the LEXIS-NEXIS retrieval system (see Chapter 14), which provides access to a very large collection of legal and business documents, is a good example of a specialized retrieval system. In such a system, a key problem is how to retrieve (almost) all documents which might be relevant to the user information need without also retrieving a large number of unrelated documents. In this context, sophisticated ranking algorithms are highly desirable. Since ranking based on single evidential sources is unlikely to provide the appropriate answers, research on approaches for combining several evidential sources seems highly relevant (as demonstrated at the various TREC conferences, see Chapter 3 for details). In the Web, the scenario is quite distinct and unique. In fact, the user of the Web frequently does not know what he wants or has great difficulty in properly formulating his request. Thus, research in advanced user interfaces is highly desirable. From the point of view of the ranking engine, an interesting problem is to study how the paradigm adopted for the user interface affects the ranking. Furthermore, it is now well established that the indexes maintained by the various Web search engines are almost disjoint (e.g., the ten most popular search engines have indexes whose intersection corresponds to less than 2% of the total number of pages indexed). In this scenario, research on meta-search engines (i.e., engines which work by fusing the rankings generated by other search engines) seems highly promising.
mir-0055	2.12    Bibliographic Discussion Early in 1960, Maron and Kuhns [547] had already discussed the issues of relevance and probabilistic indexing in information retrieval.  Twenty-three years 70        MODELING later, Salton and McGill wrote a book [698] which became a classic in the field. The book provides a thorough coverage of the three classic models in information retrieval namely, the Boolean, the vector, and the probabilistic models. Another landmark reference is the book by van Rijsbergen [785] which, besides also covering the three classic models, presents a thorough and enjoyable discussion on the probabilistic model. The book edited by Prakes and Baeza-Yates [275] presents several data structures and algorithms for IR and is more recent. Further, it includes a discussion of ranking algorithms by Harman [340] which provides interesting insights into the history of information retrieval from 1960 to 1990. Boolean operations and their implementation are covered in [803]. The inadequacy of Boolean queries for information retrieval was characterized early on by Verhoeff, Goffman, and Belzer [786]. The issue of adapting the Boolean formalism to operate with other frameworks received great attention. Book-stein discusses the problems related with merging Boolean and weighted retrieval systems [101] and the implications of Boolean structure for probabilistic retrieval [103]. Losee and Bookstein [522] cover the usage of Boolean queries with probabilistic retrieval. Anick et al. [21] propose an interface based on natural language for Boolean retrieval. A thesaurus-based Boolean retrieval system is proposed in [493]. The vector model is maybe the most popular model among the research community in information retrieval. Much of this popularity is due to the long-term research of Salton and his associates [697, 704]. Most of this research revolved around the SMART retrieval system developed at Cornell University [695, 842, 696]. Term weighting for the vector model has also been investigated thoroughly. Simple term weighting was used early on by Salton and Lesk [697]. Sparck Jones introduced the idf factor [409, 410] and Salton and Yang verified its effectiveness for improving retrieval [704]. Yu and Salton [842] further studied the effects of term weighting in the final ranking. Salton and Buckley [696] summarize 20 years of experiments in term weighting with the SMART system. Raghavan and Wong [665] provide a critical analysis of the vector model. The probabilistic model was introduced by Robertson and Sparck Jones [677] and is thoroughly discussed in [785]. Experimental studies with the model were conducted by Sparck Jones [411, 412] which used feedback from the user to estimate the initial probabilities. Croft and Harper [199] proposed a method to estimate these probabilities without feedback from the user. Croft [198] later on added within-document frequency weights into the model. Fuhr discusses probabilistic indexing through polynomial retrieval functions [281, 284]. Cooper, Gey, and Dabney [186] and later on Gey [295] propose the use of logistic regression with probabilistic retrieval. Lee and Kantor [494] study the effect of inconsistent expert judgements on probabilistic retrieval. Puhr [282] reviews various variants of the classic probabilistic model. Cooper [187], in a seminal paper, raises troubling questions on the utilization of the probabilistic ranking principle in information retrieval. The inference network model was introduced by Turtle and Croft [772, 771] in 1990. Haines and Croft [332] discuss the utilization of inference networks for user relevance feedback (see Chapter 5).   Callan, Lu, and Croft [139] use an BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        71 inference network to search distributed document collections. Callan [138], in his turn, discusses the application of inference networks to information filtering. The belief network model, due to Ribeiro-Neto and Muntz [674], generalizes the inference network model. The extended Boolean model was introduced by Salton, Fox, and Wu [703]. Lee, Kim, Kim, and Lee [496] discuss the evaluation of Boolean operators with the extended Boolean model, while properties of the model are discussed in [495]. The generalized vector space model was introduced in 1985 by Wong, Ziarko, and Wong [832, 831]. Latent semantic indexing was introduced in 1988 by Furnas, Deerwester, Dumais, Landauer, Harshman, Streeter, and Lochbaum [287]. In a subsequent paper, Bartell, Cottrell, and Belew [62] show that latent semantic indexing can be interpreted as a special case of multidimensional scaling. Regarding neural network models for information retrieval, our discussion in this book is based mainly on the work by Wilkinson and Hingston [815]. But we also benefited from the writings of Kwok on the subject and related topics [466, 467, 469, 468]. The fuzzy set model (for information retrieval) covered in this book is due to Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi [616]. The utilization of fuzzy theory in information retrieval goes back to the 1970s with the work of Radecki [658, 659, 660, 661], of Sachs [691], and of Tahani [755]. Bookstein [102] proposes the utilization of fuzzy operators to deal with weighted Boolean searches. Kraft and Buel [461] utilize fuzzy sets to generalize a Boolean system. Miyamoto, Miyake, and Nakayama [567] discuss the generation of a pseudothesaurus using co-occurrences and fuzzy operators. Subsequently, Miyamoto and Nakayama [568] discuss the utilization of this thesaurus with information retrieval systems. Our discussion on structured text is based on the survey by [41]. Another survey of interest (an older one though) is the work by MacLeod [533]. Burkowski [132, 133] proposed a model based on non-overlapping regions. Clarke, Cormack, and Burkowski [173] extended this model with overlapping capabilities. The model based on proximal nodes was proposed by Navarro and Baeza-Yates [589, 590]. In [534], MacLeod introduced a model based on a single hierarchy which also associates attributes with nodes in the hierarchy (for database-like querying) and hypertext links with pairs of nodes. Kilpelainen and Mannila [439] discuss the retrieval from hierarchical texts through the specification of partial patterns. In [183], Consens and Milo discuss algebras for querying text regions. A classic reference on hypertexts is the book by Nielsen [604], Another popular reference is the book by Shneiderman and Kearsley [727]. Conklin [181] presents an introductory survey of the area. The Communications of the ACM dedicated an special edition [177] to hypermedia which discusses in detail the Dexter model ó a reference standard on the terminology and semantics of basic hypermedia concepts. A subsequent edition [178] was dedicated to the presentation of various models for supporting the design of hypermedia applications.
mir-0057	3.1    Introduction Before the final implementation of an information retrieval system, an evaluation of the system is usually carried out. The type of evaluation to be considered depends on the objectives of the retrieval system. Clearly, any software system has to provide the functionality it was conceived for. Thus, the first type of evaluation which should be considered is a functional analysis in which the specified system functionalities are tested one by one. Such an analysis should also include an error analysis phase in which, instead of looking for functionalities, one behaves erratically trying to make the system fail. It is a simple procedure which can be quite useful for catching programming errors. Given that the system has passed the functional analysis phase, one should proceed to evaluate the performance of the system. The most common measures of system performance are time and space. The shorter the response time, the smaller the space used, the better the system is considered to be. There is an inherent tradeoff between space complexity and time complexity which frequently allows trading one for the other. In Chapter 8 we discuss this issue in detail. In a system designed for providing data retrieval, the response time and the space required are usually the metrics of most interest and the ones normally adopted for evaluating the system. In this case, we look for the performance of the indexing structures (which are in place to accelerate the search), the interaction with the operating system, the delays in communication channels, and the overheads introduced by the many software layers which are usually present. We refer to such a form of evaluation simply as performance evaluation. In a system designed for providing information retrieval, other metrics, besides time and space, are also of interest. In fact, since the user query request is inherently vague, the retrieved documents are not exact answers and have to be ranked according to their relevance to the query. Such relevance ranking introduces a component which is not present in data retrieval systems and which plays a central role in information retrieval. Thus, information retrieval systems require the evaluation of how precise is the answer set. This type of evaluation is referred to as retrieval performance evaluation. 74        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION In this chapter, we discuss retrieval performance evaluation for information retrieval systems. Such an evaluation is usually based on a test reference collection and on an evaluation measure. The test reference collection consists of a collection of documents, a set of example information requests, and a set of relevant documents (provided by specialists) for each example information request. Given a retrieval strategy 5, the evaluation measure quantifies (for each example information request) the similarity between the set of documents retrieved by S and the set of relevant documents provided by the specialists. This provides an estimation of the goodness of the retrieval strategy S. In our discussion, we first cover the two most used retrieval evaluation measures: recall and precision. We also cover alternative evaluation measures such as the E measure, the harmonic mean, satisfaction, frustration, etc. Following that, we cover four test reference collections namely, TIPSTER/TREC, CACM, CISI, and Cystic Fibrosis.
mir-0058	3.2    Retrieval Performance Evaluation When considering retrieval performance evaluation, we should first consider the retrieval task that is to be evaluated. For instance, the retrieval task could consist simply of a query processed in batch mode (i.e., the user submits a query and receives an answer back) or of a whole interactive session (i.e., the user specifies his information need through a series of interactive steps with the system). Further, the retrieval task could also comprise a combination of these two strategies. Batch and interactive query tasks are quite distinct processes and thus their evaluations are also distinct. In fact, in an interactive session, user effort, characteristics of the interface design, guidance provided by the system, and duration of the session are critical aspects which should be observed and measured. In a batch session, none of these aspects is nearly as important as the quality of the answer set generated. Besides the nature of the query request, one has also to consider the setting where the evaluation will take place and the type of interface used. Regarding the setting, evaluation of experiments performed in a laboratory might be quite distinct from evaluation of experiments carried out in a real life situation. Regarding the type of interface, while early bibliographic systems (which still dominate the commercial market as discussed in Chapter 14) present the user with interfaces which normally operate in batch mode, newer systems (which are been popularized by the high quality graphic displays available nowadays) usually present the user with complex interfaces which often operate interactively. Retrieval performance evaluation in the early days of computer-based information retrieval systems focused primarily on laboratory experiments designed for batch interfaces. In the 1990s, a lot more attention has been paid to the evaluation of real life experiments. Despite this tendency, laboratory experimentation is still dominant. Two main reasons are the repeatability and the scalability provided by the closed setting of a laboratory. RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION        75 In this book, we focus mainly on experiments performed in laboratories. In this chapter in particular we discuss solely the evaluation of systems which operate in batch mode. Evaluation of systems which operate interactively is briefly discussed in Chapter 10.
mir-0059	3.2.1    Recall and Precision Consider an example information request / (of a test reference collection) and its set R of relevant documents. Let \R\ be the number of documents in this set. Assume that a given retrieval strategy (which is being evaluated) processes the information request / and generates a document answer set A. Let \A\ be the number of documents in this set. Further, let \Ra\ be the number of documents in the intersection of the sets R and A. Figure 3.1 illustrates these sets. The recall and precision measures are defined as follows. ï Recall is the fraction of the relevant documents (the set R) which has been retrieved i.e., Recall = \R\ ï Precision is the fraction of the retrieved documents (the set A) which is relevant i.e., Precision = \A\ Recall and precision, as defined above, assume that all the documents in the answer set A have been examined (or seen). However, the user is not usually presented with all the documents in the answer set A at once.   Instead, the Relevant Docs in Answer Set                 ^-------_^ Collection Relevant Docs         Answer Set' |*|                       \A\ Figure 3.1    Precision and recall for a given example information request. 76        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION documents in A are first sorted according to a degree of relevance (i.e., a ranking is generated). The user then examines this ranked list starting from the top document. In this situation, the recall and precision measures vary as the user proceeds with his examination of the answer set A. Thus, proper evaluation requires plotting a precision versus recall curve as follows. As before, consider a reference collection and its set of example information requests. Let us focus on a given example information request for which a query q is formulated. Assume that a set Rq containing the relevant documents for q has been defined. Without loss of generality, assume further that the set Rq is composed of the following documents Rq = {^3,^5,^9, ^25, ^39^44, ^56^71)^89? d\2z]                                   (3.1) Thus, according to a group of specialists, there are ten documents which are relevant to the query q. Consider now a new retrieval algorithm which has just been designed. Assume that this algorithm returns, for the query g, a ranking of the documents in the answer set as follows. Ranking for query q: 1.	d\2Z ï	6.  CI9 ï	11.	"38 2.		7. d5n	12.	d48 3.	d56 ï	8.  di29	13. 4.	de	9-  ^187	14.	dn 5.	d8	10.  ^25 ï	15. The documents that are relevant to the query q are marked with a bullet after the document number. If we examine this ranking, starting from the top document, we observe the following points. First, the document di23 which is ranked as number 1 is relevant. Further, this document corresponds to 10% of all the relevant documents in the set Rq. Thus, we say that we have a precision of 100% at 10% recall. Second, the document d$ß which is ranked as number 3 is the next relevant document. At this point, we say that we have a precision of roughly 66% (two documents out of three are relevant) at 20% recall (two of the ten relevant documents have been seen). Third, if we proceed with our examination of the ranking generated we can plot a curve of precision versus recall as illustrated in Figure 3.2. The precision at levels of recall higher than 50% drops to 0 because not all relevant documents have been retrieved. This precision versus recall curve is usually based on 11 (instead often) standard recall levels which are 0%, 10%, 20%, ..., 100%. For the recall level 0%, the precision is obtained through an interpolation procedure as detailed below. In the above example, the precision and recall figures are for a single query. Usually, however, retrieval algorithms are evaluated by running them for several distinct queries. In this case, for each query a distinct precision versus recall curve is generated. To evaluate the retrieval performance of an algorithm over RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 77 Figure 3.2    Precision at 11 standard recall levels. all test queries, we average the precision figures at each recall level as follows. P(r) = Pi(r) (3.2) t=l where P(r) is the average precision at the recall level r, Nq is the number of queries used, and Pi(r) is the precision at recall level r for the i-th query. Since the recall levels for each query might be distinct from the 11 standard recall levels, utilization of an interpolation procedure is often necessary. For instance, consider again the set of 15 ranked documents presented above. Assume that the set of relevant documents for the query q has changed and is now given by (3.3) In this case, the first relevant document in the ranking for query q is d5e which provides a recall level of 33.3% (with precision also equal to 33.3%) because, at this point, one-third of all relevant documents have already been seen. The second relevant document is di29 which provides a recall level of 66.6% (with precision equal to 25%). The third relevant document is d$ which provides a recall level of 100% (with precision equal to 20%). The precision figures at the 11 standard recall levels are interpolated as follows. Let fj, j E {0,1,2,..., 10}, be a reference to the j-th standard recall level (i.e., rs is a reference to the recall level 50%). Then, P(rj)-= max r3lt;rlt;r^t   P(r) (3.4) 78 RETRIEVAL EVALUATION 120 100 -gt; 80 -60 20 40 60 Recall 80 100 120 Figure  3.3    Interpolated precision at  11 standard recall levels relative to Rq  = which states that the interpolated precision at the j-th standard recall level is the maximum known precision at any recall level between the j-th recall level and the (j -f l)-th recall level. In our last example, this interpolation rule yields the precision and recall figures illustrated in Figure 3.3. At recall levels 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the interpolated precision is equal to 33.3% (which is the known precision at the recall level 33.3%). At recall levels 40%, 50%, and 60%, the interpolated precision is 25% (which is the precision at the recall level 66.6%). At recall levels 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%, the interpolated precision is 20% (which is the precision at recall level 100%). The curve of precision versus recall which results from averaging the results for various queries is usually referred to as precision versus recall figures. Such average figures are normally used to compare the retrieval performance of distinct retrieval algorithms. For instance, one could compare the retrieval performance of a newly proposed retrieval algorithm with the retrieval performance of the classic vector space model. Figure 3.4 illustrates average precision versus recall figures for two distinct retrieval algorithms. In this case, one algorithm has higher precision at lower recall levels while the second algorithm is superior at higher recall levels. One additional approach is to compute average precision at given document cutoff values. For instance, we can compute the average precision when 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, or 100 relevant documents have been seen. The procedure is analogous to the computation of average precision at 11 standard recall levels but provides additional information on the retrieval performance of the ranking algorithm. Average precision versus recall figures are now a standard evaluation strategy for information retrieval systems and are used extensively in the information retrieval literature.    They are useful because thev allow us to evaluate RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION        79 100 120 Figure 3.4    Average recall versus precision figures for two distinct retrieval algorithms. quantitatively both the quality of the overall answer set and the breadth of the retrieval algorithm. Further, they are simple, intuitive, and can be combined in a single curve. However, precision versus recall figures also have their disadvantages and their widespread usage has been criticized in the literature. We return to this point later on. Before that, let us discuss techniques for summarizing precision versus recall figures by a single numerical value. Single Value Summaries Average precision versus recall figures are useful for comparing the retrieval performance of distinct retrieval algorithms over a set of example queries. However, there are situations in which we would like to compare the retrieval performance of our retrieval algorithms for the individual queries. The reasons are twofold. First, averaging precision over many queries might disguise important anomalies in the retrieval algorithms under study. Second, when comparing two algorithms, we might be interested in investigating whether one of them outperforms the other for each query in a given set of example queries (notice that this fact can be easily hidden by an average precision computation). In these situations, a single precision value (for each query) can be used. This single value should be interpreted as a summary of the corresponding precision versus recall curve. Usually, this single value summary is taken as the precision at a specified recall level. For instance, we could evaluate the precision when we observe the first relevant document and take this precision as the single value summary. Of course, as seems obvious, this is not a good approach. More interesting strategies can be adopted as we now discuss. 80        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION Average Precision at Seen Relevant Documents The idea here is to generate a single value summary of the ranking by averaging the precision figures obtained after each new relevant document is observed (in the ranking). For instance, consider the example in Figure 3.2. The precision figures after each new relevant document is observed are 1, 0.66, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3. Thus, the average precision at seen relevant documents is given by (l+0.66+0.5-H).4-H).3)/5 or 0.57. This measure favors systems which retrieve relevant documents quickly (i.e., early in the ranking). Of course, an algorithm might present a good average precision at seen relevant documents but have a poor performance in terms of overall recall. R-Precision The idea here is to generate a single value summary of the ranking by computing the precision at the R-th position in the ranking, where R is the total number of relevant documents for the current query (i.e., number of documents in the set Rq). For instance, consider the examples in Figures 3.2 and 3.3. The value of R-precision is 0.4 for the first example (because R = 10 and there are four relevant documents among the first ten documents in the ranking) and 0.33 for the second example (because R = 3 and there is one relevant document among the first three documents in the ranking). The R-precision measure is a useful parameter for observing the behavior of an algorithm for each individual query in an experiment. Additionally, one can also compute an average R-precision figure over all queries. However, using a single number to summarize the full behavior of a retrieval algorithm over several queries might be quite imprecise. Precision Histograms The R-precision measures for several queries can be used to compare the retrieval history of two algorithms as follows. Let RPa{i) and RPb(i) be the R-precision values of the retrieval algorithms A and B for the i-th query. Define, for instance, the difference RPA/B(i) = RPA(i) - RPB(i)                                                             (3.5) A value of RPa/b^) equal to 0 indicates that both algorithms have equivalent performance (in terms of R-precision) for the i-th query.   A positive value of RPa/b(^) indicates a better retrieval performance by algorithm A (for the i-th query) while a negative value indicates a better retrieval performance by algorithm B. Figure 3.5 Illustrates the RPaib^) values (labeled R-Precision A/B) for two hypothetical retrieval algorithms over ten example queries.  The algorithm .4 is superior for eight queries while the algorithm B performs better for the two other queries (numbered 4 and 5). This type of bar graph is called a precision histogram and allows us to quickly compare the retrieval performance history of two algorithms through visual inspection. Summary Table Statistics Single mine measures can also be stored in a table to provide a statistical summary regarding the set of all the queries in a retrieval task. For instance, these RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION        81 1,5  , 1,0 0,5 Q. n U 1             2            3 -1,0 ' igt;          6           7          8           9          10 -1,5 Query Number Figure 3.5    A precision histogram for ten hypothetical queries. summary table statistics could include: the number of queries used in the task, the total number of documents retrieved by all queries, the total number of relevant documents which were effectively retrieved when all queries are considered, the total number of relevant documents which could have been retrieved by all queries, etc. Precision and Recall Appropriateness Precision and recall have been used extensively to evaluate the retrieval performance of retrieval algorithms. However, a more careful reflection reveals problems with these two measures [451, 664, 754]. First, the proper estimation of maximum recall for a query requires detailed knowledge of all the documents in the collection. With large collections, such knowledge is unavailable which implies that recall cannot be estimated precisely. Second, recall and precision are related measures which capture different aspects of the set of retrieved documents. In many situations, the use of a single measure which combines recall and precision could be more appropriate. Third, recall and precision measure the effectiveness over a set of queries processed in batch mode. However, with modern systems, interactivity (and not batch processing) is the key aspect of the retrieval process. Thus, measures which quantify the informativeness of the retrieval process might now be more appropriate. Fourth, recall and precision are easy to define when a linear ordering of the retrieved documents is enforced. For systems which require a weak ordering though, recall and precision might be inadequate. 82        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION
mir-0060	3.2.2    Alternative Measures Since recall and precision, despite their popularity, are not always the most appropriate measures for evaluating retrieval performance, alternative measures have been proposed over the years. A brief review of some of them is as follows. The Harmonic Mean As discussed above, a single measure which combines recall and precision might be of interest. One such measure is the harmonic mean F of recall and precision [422] which is computed as where r(j) is the recall for the j-th document in the ranking, P(j) is the precision for the j-th document in the ranking, and F(j) is the harmonic mean of r(j) and P(j) (thus, relative to the j-th document in the ranking). The function F assumes values in the interval [0,1]. It is 0 when no relevant documents have been retrieved and is 1 when all ranked documents are relevant. Further, the harmonic mean F assumes a high value only when both recall and precision are high. Therefore, determination of the maximum value for F can be interpreted as an attempt to find the best possible compromise between recall and precision. The E Measure Another measure which combines recall and precision was proposed by van Ri-jsbergen [785] and is called the E evaluation measure. The idea is to allow the user to specify whether he is more interested in recall or in precision.   The E measure is defined as follows. where r(j) is the recall for the j-th document in the ranking, P(j) is the precision for the j-th document in the ranking, E(j) is the E evaluation measure relative to r(j) and P{j), and b is a user specified parameter which reflects the relative importance of recall and precision. For 6 = 1, the E(j) measure works as the complement of the harmonic mean F(j). Values of b greater than 1 indicate that the user is more interested in precision than in recall while values of b smaller than I indicate that the user is more interested in recall than in precision. RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 83 User-Oriented Measures Recall and precision are based on the assumption that the set of relevant documents for a query is the same, independent of the user. However, different users might have a different interpretation of which document is relevant and which one is not. To cope with this problem, user-oriented measures have been proposed such as coverage ratio, novelty ratio, relative recall, and recall effort [451]. As before, consider a reference collection, an example information request /, and a retrieval strategy to be evaluated. Let R be the set of relevant documents for / and A be the answer set retrieved. Also, let U be the subset of R which is known to the user. The number of documents in U is \U\. The intersection of the sets A and U yields the documents known to the user to be relevant which were retrieved. Let \Rk\ be the number of documents in this set. Further, let \Ru\ be the number of relevant documents previously unknown to the user which were retrieved. Figure 3.6 illustrates the situation. The coverage ratio is defined as the fraction of the documents known (to the user) to be relevant which has actually been retrieved i.e., coverage = \Rk\ \U\ The novelty ratio is defined as the fraction of the relevant documents retrieved which was unknown to the user i.e., novelty = \Ru\ \Ru\ + \Rk\ A high coverage ratio indicates that the system is finding most of the relevant documents the user expected to see. A high novelty ratio indicates that the system is revealing (to the user) many new relevant documents which were previously unknown. Relevant Docs Relevant Docs known to the User M Answer Set Relevant Docs known to the User which were retrieved \Rk\ Relevant Docs previously unknown to the User which were retrieved Figure 3.6    Coverage and novelty ratios for a given example information request. 84       RETRIEVAL EVALUATION Additionally, two other measures can be defined as follows. The relative recall is given by the ratio between the number of relevant documents found (by the system) and the number of relevant documents the user expected to find. In the case when the user finds as many relevant documents as he expected, he stops searching and the relative recall is equal to 1. The recall effort is given by the ratio between the number of relevant documents the user expected to find and the number of documents examined in an attempt to find the expected relevant documents. Other Measures Other measures which might be of interest include the expected search length, which is good for dealing with sets of documents weakly ordered, the satisfaction, which takes into account only the relevant documents, and the frustration, which takes into account only the non-relevant documents [451].
mir-0061	3.3    Reference Collections In this section we discuss various reference collections which have been used throughout the years for the evaluation of information retrieval systems. We first discuss the TIPSTER/TREC collection which, due to its large size and thorough experimentation, is usually considered to be the reference test collection in information retrieval nowadays. Following that, we cover the CACM and ISI collections due to their historical importance in the area of information retrieval. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of the Cystic Fibrosis collection. It is a small collection whose example information requests were extensively studied by four groups of specialists before generation of the relevant document sets.
mir-0062	3.3.1    The TREC Collection Research in information retrieval has frequently been criticized on two fronts. First, that it lacks a solid formal framework as a basic foundation. Second, that it lacks robust and consistent testbeds and benchmarks. The first of these criticisms is difficult to dismiss entirely due to the Inherent degree of psychological suhjectiveness associated with the task of deciding on the relevance of a given document (which characterizes information, as opposed to data, retrieval). Thus, at least for now, research in information retrieval will have to proceed without a solid formal underpinning. The second of these criticisms, however, can be acted upon. For three decades, experimentation in information retrieval was based on relatively small test collections which did not reflect the main issues present in a large bibliographical environment. Further, comparisons between various retrieval systems were difficult to make because distinct groups conducted experiments focused on distinct aspects of retrieval (even when the same test collection was used) and there were no widely accepted benchmarks. REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        85 In the early 1990s, a reaction to this state of disarray was initiated under the leadership of Donna Harman at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in Maryland. Such an effort consisted of promoting a yearly conference, named TREC for Text REtrieval Conference, dedicated to experimentation with a large test collection comprising over a million documents. For each TREC conference, a set of reference experiments is designed. The research groups which participate in the conference use these reference experiments for comparing their retrieval systems. A clear statement of the purpose of the TREC conferences can be found in the NIST TREC Web site [768] and reads as follows. The TREC conference series is co-sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Information Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of the TIPSTER Text Program. The goal of the conference series is to encourage research in information retrieval from large text applications by providing a large test collection, uniform scoring procedures, and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their results. Attendance at TREC conferences is restricted to those researchers and developers who have performed the TREC retrieval tasks and to selected government personnel from sponsoring agencies. Participants in a TREC conference employ a wide variety of retrieval techniques, including methods using automatic thesauri, sophisticated term weighting, natural language techniques, relevance feedback, and advanced pattern matching. Each system works with the same test collection that consists of about 2 gigabytes of text (over 1 million documents) and a given set of information needs called "topics.' Results are run through a common evaluation package so that groups can compare the effectiveness of different techniques and can determine how differences between systems affect performance. Since the collection was built under the TIPSTER program, it is frequently referred to as the TIPSTER or the TIPSTER/TREC test collection.    Here, however, for simplicity we refer to it as the TREC collection. The first TREC conference was held at NIST in November 1992, while the second TREC conference occurred in August 1993. In November 1997, the sixth TREC conference was held (also at NIST) and counted the following participating organizations (extracted from [794]): Apple Computer                                      City Univ., London ATT Labs Research                               CLARITECH Corporation Australian National Univ.

Cambridge Univ. Waterloo Verity, Inc. Xerox Res. Centre Europe The seventh TREC conference was held again at NIST in November of 1998. In the following, we briefly discuss the TREC document collection and the (benchmark) tasks at the TREC conferences. As with most test collections, the TREC collection is composed of three parts: the documents, the example information requests (called topics in the TREC nomenclature), and a set of relevant documents for each example information request. Further, the TREC conferences also include a set of tasks to be used as a benchmark. The Document Collection The TREC collection has been growing steadily over the years. At TREC-3, the collection size was roughly 2 gigabytes while at TREC-6 it had gone up to roughly 5.8 gigabytes. In the beginning, copyright restrictions prevented free distribution of the collection and, as a result, the distribution CD-ROM disks had to be bought. In 1998, however, an arrangement was made which allows free access to the documents used in the most recent TREC conferences. As a result, TREC disk 4 and TREC disk 5 are now available from NIST at a small fee (US$200 in 1998) to cover distribution costs. Information on how to obtain the collection (which comes with the disks) and the topics with their relevant document sets (which have to be retrieved through the network) can be obtained directly from the NIST TREC Web site [768]. The TREC collection is distributed in six CD-ROM disks of roughly 1 gigabyte of compressed text each- The documents come from the following sources: WSJ        -?

Stopwords are not removed and no stemming is performed (see Chapter 7 for details on stemming). tagged with SGML (see Chapter 6) to allow easy parsing (which implies simple coding for the groups participating at TREC conferences). Major structures such as a field for the document number (identified by lt;DOCNOgt;) and a field for the document text (identified by lt;TEXTgt;) are common to all documents. Minor structures might be different across subcollections to preserve parts of the structure in the original document. This has been the philosophy for formatting decisions at NIST: preserve as much of the original structure as possible while providing a common framework which allows simple decoding of the data. An example of a TREC document is the document numbered 880406-0090 RETRIEVAL EVALUATION lt;docgt; lt;docnogt; WSJ880406-0090 lt;/docnogt; lt;hlgt; ATT Unveils Services to Upgrade Phone Networks Under Global Plan lt;/hlgt; lt;authorgt; Janet Guyon (WSJ Staff) lt;/authorgt; lt; dateline gt; New York lt;/dateline gt; lt;textgt; American Telephone ; Telegraph Co. introduced the first of a new generation of phone services with broad ... lt;/textgt; lt;/docgt; Figure 3.7   TREC document numbered WSJ880406-0090. in the Wall Street Journal subcollection which is shown in Figure 3.7 (extracted from [342]). Further details on the TREC document collection can be obtained from [794, 768]. The Example Information Requests (Topics) The TREC collection includes a set of example information requests which can be used for testing a new ranking algorithm. Each request is a description of an information need in natural language. In the TREC nomenclature, each test information request is referred to as a topic. An example of an information request in TREC is the topic numbered 168 (prepared for the TREC-3 conference) which is illustrated in Figure 3.8 (extracted from [342]). The task of converting an information request (topic) into a system query (i.e., a set of index terms, a Boolean expression, a fuzzy expression, etc.) must be done by the system itself and is considered to be an integral part of the evaluation procedure. The number of topics prepared for the first six TREC conferences goes up to 350. The topics numbered 1 to 150 were prepared for use with the TREC-1 and TREC-2 conferences. They were written by people who were experienced users of real systems and represented long-standing information needs. The topics numbered 151 to 200 were prepared for use with the TREC-3 conference, are shorter, and have a simpler structure which includes only three subfields (named Title, Description, and Narrative as illustrated in the topic 168 above). The topics numbered 201 to 250 were prepared for use with the TREC-4 conference and are even shorter. At the TREC-5 (which included topics 251-300) and TREC-6 (which included topics 301-350) conferences, the topics were prepared with a composition similar to the topics in TREC-3 (i.e., they were expanded with respect to the topics in TREC-4 which were considered to be too short). REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        89 lt;topgt; lt;numgt; Number: 168 lt;titlegt; Topic: Financing AMTRAK lt;descgt; Description: A document will address the role of the Federal Government in financing the operation of the National Railroad Transportation Corporation (AMTRAK). lt;narrgt; Narrative: A relevant document must provide information on the government's responsibility to make AMTRAK an economically viable entity. It could also discuss the privatization of AMTRAK as an alternative to continuing government subsidies. Documents comparing government subsidies given to air and bus transportation with those provided to AMTRAK would also be relevant. lt;/topgt; Figure 3.8    Topic numbered 168 in the TREC collection. The Relevant Documents for Each Example Information Request At the TREC conferences, the set of relevant documents for each example information request (topic) is obtained from a pool of possible relevant documents. This pool is created by taking the top K documents (usually, K = 100) in the rankings generated by the various participating retrieval systems. The documents in the pool are then shown to human assessors who ultimately decide on the relevance of each document. This technique for assessing relevance is called the pooling method [794] and is based on two assumptions. First, that the vast majority of the relevant documents is collected in the assembled pool. Second, that the documents which are not in the pool can be considered to be not relevant. Both assumptions have been verified to be accurate in tests done at the TREC conferences. A detailed description of these relevance assessments can be found in [342, 794]. The (Benchmark) Tasks at the TREC Conferences The TREC conferences include two main information retrieval tasks [342]. In the first, called ad hoc task, a set of new (conventional) requests are run against a fixed document database. This is the situation which normally occurs in a library where a user is asking new queries against a set of static documents. In the second, called routing task, a set of fixed requests are run against a database whose documents are continually changing. This is like a filtering task in which the same questions are always being asked against a set of dynamic documents (for instance, news clipping services). Unlike a pure filtering task, however, the retrieved documents must be ranked. 90        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION For the ad hoc task, the participant systems receive the test information requests and execute them on a pre-specified document collection. For the routing task, the participant systems receive the test information requests and two distinct document collections. The first collection is used for training and allows the tuning of the retrieval algorithm. The second collection is used for testing the tuned retrieval algorithm. Starting at the TREC-4 conference, new secondary tasks, besides the ad hoc and routing tasks, were introduced with the purpose of allowing more specific comparisons among the various systems. At TREC-6, eight (specific) secondary tasks were added in as follows. ª Chinese Ad hoc task in which both the documents and the topics are in Chinese. ï  Filtering Routing task in which the retrieval algorithm has only to decide whether a new incoming document is relevant (in which case it is taken) or not (in which case it is discarded). No ranking of the documents taken needs to be provided. The test data (incoming documents) is processed in time-stamp order. ï  Interactive Task in which a human searcher interacts with the retrieval system to determine the relevant documents. Documents are ruled relevant or not relevant (i.e., no ranking is provided). ï  NLP Task aimed at verifying whether retrieval algorithms based on natural language processing offer advantages when compared to the more traditional retrieval algorithms based on index terms. ï  Cross languages Ad hoc task in wrhich the documents are in one language but the topics are in a different language. ï  High precision Task in which the user of a retrieval system is asked to retrieve ten documents that answer a given (and previously unknown) information request within five minutes (wall clock time). ï  Spoken document retrieval Task in which the documents are written transcripts of radio broadcast news shows. Intended to stimulate research on retrieval techniques for spoken documents. ï  Very large corpus Ad hoc task in which the retrieval systems have to deal with collections of size 20 gigabytes (7.5 million documents). For TREC-7, the NLP and the Chinese secondary tasks were discontinued. Additionally, the routing task was retired as a main task because there is a consensus that the filtering task is a more realistic type of routing task. TREC-7 also included a new task called Query Task in which several distinct query versions were created for each example information request [794]. The main goal of this task is to allow investigation of query-dependent retrieval strategies, a well known problem with the TREC collection due to the sparsity of the given information requests (which present very little overlap) used in past TREC conferences. REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        91 Besides providing detailed descriptions of the tasks to be executed, the TREC conferences also make a clear distinction between two basic techniques for transforming the information requests (which are in natural language) into query statements (which might be in vector form, in Boolean form, etc.). In the TREC-6 conference, the allowable query construction methods were divided into automatic methods, in which the queries were derived completely automatically from the test information requests, and manual methods, in which the queries were derived using any means other than the fully automatic method [794]. Evaluation Measures at the TREC Conferences At the TREC conferences, four basic types of evaluation measures are used: summary table statistics, recall-precision averages, document level averages, and average precision histograms. Briefly, these measures can be described as follows (see further details on these measures in Section 3.2). ï  Summary table statistics Consists of a table which summarizes statistics relative to a given task. The statistics included are: the number of topics (information requests) used in the task, the number of documents retrieved over all topics, the number of relevant documents which were effectively retrieved for all topics, and the number of relevant documents which could have been retrieved for all topics. ï  Recall-precision averages Consists of a table or graph with average precision (over all topics) at 11 standard recall levels.   Since the recall levels of the individual queries are seldom equal to the standard recall levels, interpolation is used to define the precision at the standard recall levels.   Further, a non-interpolated average precision over seen relevant documents (and over all topics) might be included. ï  Document level averages In this case, average precision (over all topics) is computed at specified document cutoff values (instead of standard recall levels).   For instance, the average precision might be computed when 5, 10, 20, 100 relevant documents have been seen.   Further, the average R-precision value (over all queries) might also be provided. ï  Average precision histogram Consists of a graph which includes a single measure for each separate topic. This measure (for a topic ti) is given, for instance, by the difference between the R-precision (for topic tz) for a target retrieval algorithm and the average R-precision (for topic t%) computed from the results of all participating retrieval systems.
mir-0063	3.3.2    The CACM and ISI Collections The TREC collection is a large collection which requires time consuming preparation before experiments can be carried out effectively at a local site. Further, 92        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION the testing itself is also time consuming and requires much more effort than that required to execute the testing in a small collection. For groups who are not interested in making this investment, an alternative approach is to use a smaller test collection which can be installed and experimented with in a much shorter time. Further, a small collection might include features which are not present in the larger TREC collection. For instance, it is well known that the example information requests at TREC present very little overlap among themselves and thus are not very useful for investigating the impact of techniques which take advantage of information derived from dependencies between the current and past user queries (an issue which received attention at the TREC-7 conference). Further, the TREC collection does not provide good support for experimenting with algorithms which combine distinct evidential sources (such as co-citations, bibliographic coupling, etc.) to generate a ranking. In these situations, alternative (and smaller) test collections might be more appropriate. For the experimental studies in [271], five different (small) test collections were developed: ADI (documents on information science), CACM, INSPEC (abstracts on electronics, computer, and physics), ISI, and Medlars (medical articles). In this section we cover two of them in detail: the CACM and the ISI test collections. Our discussion is based on the work by Fox [272]. The CACM Collection The documents in the CACM test collection consist of all the 3204 articles published in the Communications of the ACM from the first issue in 1958 to the last number of 1979. Those documents cover a considerable range of computer science literature due to the fact that the CACM served for many years as the premier periodical in the field. Besides the text of the documents, the collection also includes information on structured subfields (called concepts by Fox) as follows: ï  author names ï  date information ï  word stems from the title and abstract sections ï  categories derived from a hierarchical classification scheme ï  direct references between articles ï  bibliographic coupling connections ï  number of co-citations for each pair of articles. The subfields 'author names5 and "date information' provide information on authors and date of publication. The subfield 'word stems1 provides, for each document, a list of indexing terms (from the title and abstract sections) which have been stemmed (i.e., reduced to their grammatical roots as explained in Chapter 7). The subfield "categories' assigns a list of classification categories (from the Computing Reviews category scheme) to each document.  Since the REFERENCE COLLECTIONS        93 categories are fairly broad, the number of categories for any given document is usually smaller than five. The subfield 'direct references' provides a list of pairs of documents [da,d] in which each pair identifies a document da which includes a direct reference to a document d^. The subfield 'bibliographic coupling' provides a list of triples [di,d2,ttCited] m which the documents d\ and c?2 both include a direct reference to a same third document dj and the factor ncite(i counts the number of documents dj cited by both d\ and cfe- The subfield 'co-citations' provides a list of triples [di,d2 ,nCiting] in which the documents d\ and cfe are both cited by a same third document dj and the factor nCiting counts the number of documents dj citing both d\ and d^. Thus, the CACM collection provides a unique environment for testing retrieval algorithms which are based on information derived from cross-citing patterns ó a topic which has attracted much attention in the past. The CACM collection also includes a set of 52 test information requests. For instance, the information request numbered 1 reads as follows. What articles exist which deal with TSS (Time Sharing System), an operating system for IBM computers? For each information request, the collection also includes two Boolean query formulations and a set of relevant documents. Since the information requests are fairly specific, the average number of relevant documents for each information request is small and around 15. As a result, precision and recall figures tend to be low. The ISI Collection The 1460 documents in the ISI (often referred to as CISI) test collection were selected from a previous collection assembled by Small [731] at the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). The documents selected (which are about information sciences) were those most cited in a cross-citation study done by Small. The main purpose of the ISI collection is to support investigation of similarities based on terms and on cross-citation patterns. The documents in the ISI collection include three types of subfieids as follows. ï  author names ï  word stems from the title and abstract sections ï  number of co-citations for each pair of articles. The meaning of each of these subfieids is as in the CACM collection. The ISI collection includes a total of 35 test information requests (in natural language) for which there are Boolean query formulations. It also includes 41 additional test information requests for which there is no Boolean query formulation (only the version in natural language).  The information requests are 94        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION fairly general which resulted in a larger number of relevant documents to each request (around 50). However, many of these relevant documents have no terms in common with the information requests which implies that precision and recall figures tend to be low. Statistics for the CACM and ISI Collections Tables 3.2 and 3.3 provide comparative summary statistics for the CACM and the ISI test collections. Collection    Num. Docs    Num. Terms    Terms/Docs.

We notice that, compared to the size of the collection, the ISI collection has a much higher percentage of relevant documents per query (3.4%) than the CACM collection (0.5%). However, as already discussed, many of the relevant documents in the ISI collection have no terms in common with the respective information requests which usually yields low precision. Related Test Collections At the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Fox has assembled together nine small test collections in a CD-ROM. These test collections have sizes comparable to those of the CACM and ISI collections, but include their own particularities. Since they have been used throughout the years for evaluation of information retrieval systems, they provide a good setting for the preliminary testing of information retrieval algorithms. A list of these nine test collections is provided in Table 3.4.

The collection also includes 100 information requests (generated by an expert with two decades of clinical and research experience with cystic fibrosis) and the documents relevant to each query. Further, 4 separate relevance scores are provided for each relevant document. These relevance scores can be 0 (which indicates non-relevance), 1 (which indicates marginal relevance), and 2 (which indicates high relevance). Thus, the overall relevance score for a document (relative to a given query) varies from 0 to 8. Three of the relevance scores were provided by subject experts while the fourth relevance score was provided by a medical bibliographer. Table 3.5 provides some statistics regarding the information requests in the CF collection. We notice that the number of queries with at least one relevant document is close to the total number of queries in the collection. Further, for various relevance thresholds (the minimum value of relevance score used to characterize relevance), the average number of relevant documents per query is between 10 and 30. The CF collection, despite its small size, has two important characteristics. First, its set of relevance scores was generated directly by human experts through a careful evaluation strategy. Second, it includes a good number of information requests (relative to the collection size) and, as a result, the respective query vectors present overlap among themselves.   This allows experimentation 96        RETRIEVAL EVALUATION Relevance	Queries	Min.	Num.	Max.	Num.	Avg.	Num.

mir-0065	3.4    Trends and Research Issues A major trend today is research in interactive user interfaces. The motivation is a general belief that effective retrieval is highly dependent on obtaining proper feedback from the user. Thus, evaluation studies of interactive interfaces will tend to become more common in the near future. The main issues revolve around deciding which evaluation measures are most appropriate in this scenario. A typical example is the informativeness measure [754] introduced in 1992. Furthermore, the proposal, the study, and the characterization of alternative measures to recall and precision, such as the harmonic mean and the E measures, continue to be of interest.
mir-0066	3.5    Bibliographic Discussion A nice chapter on retrieval performance evaluation appeared in the book by Salton and McGill [698]. Even if outdated, it is still interesting reading. The book by Khorfage [451] also includes a full chapter on retrieval evaluation.  A recent paper by Mizzaro [569] presents a very complete survey of relevance studies throughout the years. About 160 papers are discussed in this paper. Two recent papers by Shaw, Burgin, and Howel [422, 423] discuss standards and evaluations in test collections for cluster-based and vector-based retrieval models. These papers also discuss the advantages of the harmonic mean (of recall and precision) as a single alternative measure for recall and precision. Problems with recall and precision related to systems which require a weak document ordering are discussed by Raghavan, Bollmann, and Jung [664, 663]. Tague-Sutcliffe proposes a measure of iiiformativeiiess for evaluating interactive user sessions [754]. BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        97 Our discussion of the TREC collection is based on the papers by Har-man [342] and by Vorhees and Harman [794]. The TREC collection is the most important reference collection nowadays for evaluation of complex information requests which execute on a large collection. Our coverage of the CACM and ISI collections is based on the work by Fox [272]. These collections are small, require short setup time, and provide a good environment for testing retrieval algorithms which are based on information derived from cross-citing patterns ó a topic which has attracted much attention in the past [94, 435, 694, 730, 732, 809] and which might nourish again in the context of the Web. The discussion on the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) collection is based on the work by Shaw, Wood, Wood, and Tibbo [721]. The CF collection is also small but includes a set of relevance scores carefully generated by human experts. Furthermore, its example information requests present overlap among themselves which allows the testing of retrieval algorithms that take advantage of past user sessions to improve retrieval performance.
mir-0068	4.1    Introduction We cover in this chapter the different kinds of queries normally posed to text retrieval systems. This is in part dependent on the retrieval model the system adopts, i.e., a full-text system will not answer the same kinds of queries as those answered by a system based on keyword ranking (as Web search engines) or on a hypertext model. In Chapter 8 we explain how the user queries are solved, while in this chapter we show which queries can be formulated. The type of query the user might formulate is largely dependent on the underlying information retrieval model. The different models for text retrieval systems are covered in Chapter 2. As in previous chapters, we want to distinguish between information retrieval and data retrieval, as we use this dichotomy to classify different query languages. We have chosen to distinguish first languages that allow the answer to be ranked, that is, languages for information retrieval. As covered in Chapter 2, for the basic information retrieval models, keyword-based retrieval is the main type of querying task. For query languages not aimed at information retrieval, the concept of ranking cannot be easily defined, so we consider them as languages for data retrieval. Furthermore, some query languages are not intended for final users and can be viewed as languages that a higher level software package should use to query an on-line database or a CD-ROM archive. In that case, we talk about protocols rather than query languages. Depending on the user experience, a different query language will be used. For example, if the user knows exactly what he wants, the retrieval task is easier and ranking may not even be needed. An important issue is that most query languages try to use the content (i.e., the semantics) and the structure of the text (i.e., the text syntax) to find relevant documents. In that sense, the system may fail to find the relevant answers (see Chapter 3). For this reason, a number of techniques meant to enhance the usefulness of the queries exist. Examples include the expansion of a word to the set of its synonyms or the use of a thesaurus and stemming to 99 100        QUERY LANGUAGES put together all the derivatives of the same word. Moreover, some words which are very frequent and do not carry meaning (such as 'the'), called stopwords, may be removed. This subject is covered in Chapter 7. Here we assume that all the query preprocessing has already been done. Although these operations are usually done for information retrieval, many of them can also be useful in a data retrieval context. When we want to emphasize the difference between words that can be retrieved by a query and those which cannot, we call the former 'keywords.' Orthogonal to the kind of queries that can be asked is the subject of the retrieval unit the information system adopts. The retrieval unit is the basic element which can be retrieved as an answer to a query (normally a set of such basic elements is retrieved, sometimes ranked by relevance or other criterion). The retrieval unit can be a file, a document, a Web page, a paragraph, or some other structural unit which contains an answer to the search query. Prom this point on, we will simply call those retrieval units 'documents,' although as explained this can have different meanings (see also Chapter 2). This chapter is organized as follows. We first show the queries that can be formulated with keyword-based query languages. They are aimed at information retrieval, including simple words and phrases as well as Boolean operators which manipulate sets of documents. In the second section we cover pattern matching, which includes more complex queries and is generally aimed at complementing keyword searching with more powerful data retrieval capabilities. Third, we cover querying on the structure of the text, which is more dependent on the particular text model. Finally, we finish with some standard protocols used on the Internet and by CD-ROM publishers.
mir-0069	4.2    Keyword-Based Querying A query is the formulation of a user information need. In its simplest form, a query is composed of keywords and the documents containing such keywords are searched for. Keyword-based queries are popular because they are intuitive, easy to express, and allow for fast ranking. Thus, a query can be (and in many cases is) simply a word, although it can in general be a more complex combination of operations involving several words. In the rest of this chapter we will refer to single-word and multiple-word queries as basic queries.   Patterns, which are covered in section 4.3, are also considered as basic queries.
mir-0070	4.2.1    Single-Word Queries The most elementary query that can be formulated in a text retrieval system is a word. Text documents are assumed to be essentially long sequences of words. Although some models present a more general view, virtually all models allow us KEYWORD-BASED QUERYING         101 to see the text in this perspective and to search words. Some models are also able to see the internal division of words into letters. These latter models permit the searching of other types of patterns, which are covered in section 4.3. The set of words retrieved by these extended queries can then be fed into the word-treating machinery, say to perform thesaurus expansion or for ranking purposes. A word is normally defined in a rather simple way. The alphabet is split into 'letters' and 'separators,' and a word is a sequence of letters surrounded by separators. More complex models allow us to specify that some characters are not letters but do not split a word, e.g. the hyphen in 'on-line.' It is good practice to leave the choice of what is a letter and what is a separator to the manager of the text database. The division of the text into words is not arbitrary, since words carry a lot of meaning in natural language. Because of that, many models (such as the vector model) are completely structured on the concept of words, and words are the only type of queries allowed (moreover, some systems only allow a small set of words to be extracted from the documents). The result of word queries is the set of documents containing at least one of the words of the query. Further, the resulting documents are ranked according to a degree of similarity to the query. To support ranking, two common statistics on word occurrences inside texts are commonly used: 'term frequency' which counts the number of times a word appears inside a document and 'inverse document frequency' which counts the number of documents in which a word appears. See Chapter 2 for more details. Additionally, the exact positions where a word appears in the text may be required for instance, by an interface which highlights each occurrence of that word.
mir-0071	4.2.2    Context Queries Many systems complement single-word queries with the ability to search words in a given context, that is, near other words. Words which appear near each other may signal a higher likelihood of relevance than if they appear apart. For instance, we may want to form phrases of words or find words which are proximal in the text. Therefore, we distinguish two types of queries: ï  Phrase  is a sequence of single-word queries. An occurrence of the phrase is a sequence of words. For instance, it is possible to search for the word kenhance,' and then for the word 'retrieval/ In phrase queries it is normally understood that the separators in the text need not be the same as those in the query (e.g., two spaces versus one space), and uninteresting words are not considered at all. For instance, the previous example could match a text such as '...enhance the retrieval...1. Although the notion of a phrase is a very useful feature in most cases, not all systems implement it. ?  Proximity   A more relaxed version of the phrase query is the proximity query. In this case, a sequence of single words or phrases is given, together 102        QUERY LANGUAGES AND translation syntax                      syntactic Figure 4.1 An example of a query syntax tree. It will retrieve all the documents which contain the word 'translation' as well as either the word 'syntax' or the word 'syntactic'. with a maximum allowed distance between them. For instance, the above example could state that the two words should occur within four words, and therefore a match could be c. . .enhance the power of retrieval. . ..' This distance can be measured in characters or words depending on the system. The words and phrases may or may not be required to appear in the same order as in the query. Phrases can be ranked in a fashion somewhat analogous to single words (see Chapters 2 and 5 for details). Proximity queries can be ranked in the same way if the parameters used by the ranking technique do not depend on physical proximity. Although it is not clear how to do better ranking, physical proximity has semantic value. This is because in most cases the proximity means that the words are in the same paragraph, and hence related in some way.
mir-0072	4.2.3    Boolean Queries The oldest (and still heavily used) form of combining keyword queries is to use Boolean operators.   A Boolean query   has a syntax composed of atoms (i.e., basic queries) that retrieve documents, and of Boolean operators which work on their operands (which are sets of documents) and deliver sets of documents. Since this scheme is in general compositional (i.e., operators can be composed over the results of other operators), a query syntax tree is naturally defined, where the leaves correspond to the basic queries and the internal nodes to the operators. The query syntax tree operates on an algebra over sets of documents (and the final answer of the query is also a set of documents). This is much as, for instance, the syntax trees of arithmetic expressions where the numbers and variables are the leaves and the operations form the internal nodes. Figure 4.1 shows an example. The operators most commonly used, given two basic queries or Boolean KEYWORD-BASED QUERYING         103 subexpressions t\ and e2, are: © OR The query (ei OR 62) selects all documents which satisfy ei or 62-Duplicates are eliminated. Æ AND The query (ei AND e2) selects all documents which satisfy both e\ and e2Æ BUT The query (ei BUT e2) selects all documents which satisfy e\ but not e2. Notice that classical Boolean logic uses a NOT operation, where (NOT e2) is valid whenever 62 is not. In this case all documents not satisfying e2 should be delivered, which may retrieve a huge amount of text and is probably not what the user wants. The BUT operator, instead, restricts the universe of retrievable elements to the result of e\.\ Besides selecting the appropriate documents, the IR system may also sort the documents by some criterion, highlight the occurrences within the documents of the words mentioned in the query, and allow feedback by taking the answer set as a basis to reformulate the query. With classic Boolean systems, no ranking of the retrieved documents is normally provided. A document either satisfies the Boolean query (in which case it is retrieved) or it does not (in which case it is not retrieved). This is quite a limitation because it does not allow for partial matching between a document and a user query. To overcome this limitation, the condition for retrieval must be relaxed. For instance, a document which partially satisfies an AND condition might be retrieved. In fact, it is widely accepted that users not trained in mathematics find the meaning of Boolean operators difficult to grasp. With this problem in mind, a Lfuzzy Boolean1 set of operators has been proposed. The idea is that the meaning of AND and OR can be relaxed, such that instead of forcing an element to appear in all the operands (AND) or at least in one of the operands (OR), they retrieve elements appearing in some operands (the AND may require it to appear in more operands than the OR). Moreover, the documents are ranked higher when they have a larger number of elements in common with the query (see Chapter 2).
mir-0073	4.2.4    Natural Language Pushing the fuzzy Boolean model even further, the distinction between AND and OR can be completely blurred, so that a query becomes simply an enumeration of words and context queries. All the documents matching a portion of the user query are retrieved. Higher ranking is assigned to those documents matching more parts of the query. The negation can be handled by letting the user express t  Notice that the same problem arises in the relational calculus, which is shown similar to the relational algebra only when "unsafe' expressions are avoided.   Unsafe expressions are those that make direct or indirect reference to a universe of elements, as NOT does. 104        QUERY LANGUAGES that some words are not desired, so that the documents containing them are penalized in the ranking computation. A threshold may be selected so that the documents with very low weights are not retrieved. Under this scheme we have completely eliminated any reference to Boolean operations and entered into the field of natural language queries. In fact, one can consider that Boolean queries are a simplified abstraction of natural language queries. A number of new issues arise once this model is used, especially those related to the proper way to rank an element with respect to a query. The search criterion can be re-expressed using a different model, where documents and queries are considered just as a vector of 'term weights' (with one coordinate per interesting keyword or even per existing text word) and queries are considered in exactly the same way (context queries are not considered in this case). Therefore, the query is now internally converted into a vector of term weights and the aim is to retrieve all the vectors (documents) which are close to the query (where closeness has to be defined in the model). This allows many interesting possibilities, for instance a complete document can be used as a query (since it is also a vector), which naturally leads to the use of relevance feedback techniques (i.e., the user can select a document from the result and submit it as a new query to retrieve documents similar to the selected one). The algorithms for this model are totally different from those based on searching patterns (it is even possible that not every text word needs to be searched but only a small set of hopefully representative keywords extracted from each document). Natural language querying is also covered in Chapter 14.
mir-0074	4.3    Pattern Matching In this section we discuss more specific query formulations (based on the concept of a pattern) which allow the retrieval of pieces of text that have some property. These data retrieval queries are useful for linguistics, text statistics, and data extraction.  Their result can be fed into the composition mechanism described above to form phrases and proximity queries, comprising what we have called basic queries. Basic queries can be combined using Boolean expressions. In this sense we can view these data retrieval capabilities as enhanced tools for information retrieval. However, it is more difficult to rank the result of a pattern matching expression. A pattern is a set of syntactic features that must occur in a text segment. Those segments satisfying the pattern specifications are said to 'match" the pattern. We are interested in documents containing segments which match a given search pattern. Each system allows the specification of some types of patterns, which range from very simple (for example, words) to rather complex (such as regular expressions). In general, as more powerful is the set of patterns allowed, more involved are the queries that the user can formulate and more complex is the implementation of the search. The most used types of patterns are: PATTERN MATCHING         105 ´ Words A string (sequence of characters) which must be a word in the text (see section 4.2). This is the most basic pattern. Æ Prefixes A string which must form the beginning of a text word. For instance, given the prefix 'comput' all the documents containing words such as 'computer,' 'computation,' 'computing,' etc. are retrieved. Æ Suffixes A string which must form the termination of a text word. For instance, given the suffix 'ters' all the documents containing words such as 'computers,' 'testers,' 'painters,' etc. are retrieved. ´ Substrings A string which can appear within a text word. For instance, given the substring 'tal' all the documents containing words such as 'coastal,' 'talk,' 'metallic,' etc. are retrieved. This query can be restricted to find the substrings inside words, or it can go further and search the substring anywhere in the text (in this case the query is not restricted to be a sequence of letters but can contain word separators). For instance, a search for 'any flow' will match in the phrase '. . .many flowers. . ..' ï  Ranges A pair of strings which matches any word lying between them in lexicographical order. Alphabets are normally sorted, and this induces an order into the strings which is called lexicographical order (this is indeed the order in which words in a dictionary are listed).  For instance, the range between words 'held' and 'hold' will retrieve strings such as 'hoax' and 'hissing.' ï  Allowing errors   A word together with an error threshold.  This search pattern retrieves all text words which are "similar' to the given word. The concept of similarity can be defined in many ways. The general concept is that the pattern or the text may have errors (coming from typing, spelling, or from optical character recognition software, among others), and the query should try to retrieve the given word and what are likely to be its erroneous variants. Although there are many models for similarity among words, the most generally accepted in text retrieval is the Levenshtein distance, or simply edit distance.   The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and replacements needed to make them equal (see Chapter 6). Therefore, the query specifies the maximum number of allowed errors for a word to match the pattern (i.e., the maximum allowed edit distance). This model can also be extended to search substrings (not only words), retrieving any text segment which is at the allowed edit distance from the search pattern. Under this extended model, if a typing error splits 'flower' into "f lo wer' it could still be found with one error, while in the restricted case of words it could not (since neither kflo' nor 'wer' are at edit distance 1 fro in k flower").  Variations on this distance model are of use in computational biology for searching on DNA or protein sequences as well as in signal processing. ï  Regular expressions   Some text retrieval systems allow searching for regular expressions. A regular expression is a rather general pattern built 106        QUERY LANGUAGES up by simple strings (which are meant to be matched as substrings) and the following operators: -  union: if ei and 62 are regular expressions, then (ei|e2) matches what t\ or 62 matches. -  concatenation: if e\ and e2 are regular expressions, the occurrences of (ei 62) are formed by the occurrences of e\ immediately followed by those of 62 (therefore simple strings can be thought of as a concatenation of their individual letters). -  repetition: if e is a regular expression, then (e*) matches a sequence of zero or more contiguous occurrences of e. For instance, consider a query like 'pro (blem | tein) (s | e) (0 | 1 2)*" (where e denotes the empty string). It will match words such as cproblem021 and 'proteins.' As in previous cases, the matches can be restricted to comprise a whole word, to occur inside a word, or to match an arbitrary text segment. This can also be combined with the previous type of patterns to search a regular expression allowing errors. ï Extended patterns It is normal to use a more user-friendly query language to represent some common cases of regular expressions. Extended patterns are subsets of the regular expressions which are expressed with a simpler syntax. The retrieval system can internally convert extended patterns into regular expressions, or search them with specific algorithms. Each system supports its own set of extended patterns, and therefore no formal definition exists. Some examples found in many new systems are: -  classes of characters, i.e.   one or more positions within the pattern are matched by any character from a pre-defined set.  This involves features such as case-insensitive matching, use of ranges of characters (e.g., specifying that some character must be a digit), complements (e.g., some character must not be a letter), enumeration (e.g., a character must be a vowel), wild cards (i.e., a position within the pattern matches with anything), among others. -  conditional expressions, i.e., a part of the pattern may or may not appear. -  wild characters which match any sequence in the text, e.g. any word which starts as kflo1 and ends with 4ers,' which matches 'flowers' as well as 'flounders/ -  combinations that allow some parts of the pattern to match exactly and other parts with errors.
mir-0075	4.4    Structural Qyeries Up to now we have considered the text collection as a set of documents which can be queried with regard to their text content. This model is unable to take advantage of novel text features which are becoming commonplace, such as the (a) STRUCTURAL QUERIES (c) 107 Figure 4.2    The three main structures:   (a) form-like fixed structure, (6) hypertext structure, and (c) hierarchical structure. text structure. The text collections tend to have some structure built into them, and allowing the user to query those texts based on their structure (and not only their content) is becoming attractive. The standardization of languages to represent structured texts such as HTML has pushed forward in this direction (see Chapter 6). As discussed in Chapter 2, mixing contents and structure in queries allows us to pose very powerful queries, which are much more expressive than each query mechanism by itself. By using a query language that integrates both types of queries, the retrieval quality of textual databases can be improved. This mechanism is built on top of the basic queries, so that they select a set of documents that satisfy certain constraints on their content (expressed using words, phrases, or patterns that the documents must contain). On top of this, some structural constraints can be expressed using containment, proximity, or other restrictions on the structural elements (e.g., chapters, sections, etc.) present in the documents. The Boolean queries can be built on top of the structural queries, so that they combine the sets of documents delivered by those queries. In the Boolean syntax tree (recall the example of Figure 4.1) the structural queries form the leaves of the tree. On the other hand, structural queries can themselves have a complex syntax. We divide this section according to the type of structures found in text databases. Figure 4.2 illustrates them. Although structured query languages should be amenable for ranking, this is still an open problem. In what follows it is important to distinguish the difference between the structure that a text may have and what can be queried about that structure. In general, natural language texts may have any desired structure. However, different models allow the querying of only some aspects of the real structure. When we say that the structure allowed is restricted in some way, we mean that only the aspects which follow this restriction can be queried, albeit the text may have more structural information. For instance, it is possible that an article has a nested structure of sections and subsections, but the query model does not accept recursive structures. In this case we will not be able to query for sections included in others, although this may be the case in the texts documents under consideration. 108        QUERY LANGUAGES
mir-0076	4.4.1    Fixed Structure The structure allowed in texts was traditionally quite restrictive. The documents had a fixed set of fields, much like a filled form. Each field had some text inside. Some fields were not present in all documents. Only rarely could the fields appear in any order or repeat across a document. A document could not have text not classified under any field. Fields were not allowed to nest or overlap. The retrieval activity allowed on them was restricted to specifying that a given basic pattern was to be found only in a given field. Most current commercial systems use this model. This model is reasonable when the text collection has a fixed structure. For instance, a mail archive could be regarded as a set of mails, where each mail has a sender, a receiver, a date, a subject, and a body field. The user can thus search for the mails sent to a given person with 'football' in the subject field. However, the model is inadequate to represent the hierarchical structure present in an HTML document, for instance. If the division of the text into fields is rigid enough, the content of some fields can even be interpreted not as text but as numbers, dates, etc. thereby allowing different queries to be posed on them (e.g., month ranges in dates). It is not hard to see that this idea leads naturally to the relational model, each field corresponding to a column in the database table. Looking at the database as a text allows us to query the textual fields with much more power than is common in relational database systems. On the other hand, relational databases may make better use of their knowledge on the data types involved to build specialized and more efficient indices. A number of approaches towards combining these trends have been proposed in recent years, their main problem being that they do not achieve optimal performance because the text is usually stored together with other types of data. Nevertheless, there are several proposals that extend SQL (Structured Query Language) to allow full-text retrieval. Among them we can mention proposals by leading relational database vendors such as Oracle and Sybase, as well as SFQL, which is covered in section 4.5.
mir-0077	4.4.2    Hypertext Hypertexts probably represent the maximum freedom with respect to structuring power. A hypertext is a directed graph where the nodes hold some text and the links represent connections between nodes or between positions inside the nodes (see Chapter 2). Hypertexts have received a lot of attention since the explosion of the Web, which is indeed a gigantic hypertext-like database spread across the world. However, retrieval from a hypertext began as a merely navigational activity. That is. the user had to manually traverse the hypertext nodes following links to search what he wanted. It was not possible to query the hypertext based on its structure. Even in the Web one can search by the text contents of the nodes, but not by their structural connectivity. STRUCTURAL QUERIES        109 An interesting proposal to combine browsing and searching on the Web is WebGlimpse. It allows classical navigation plus the ability to search by content in the neighborhood of the current node. Currently, some query tools have appeared that achieve the goal of querying hypertexts based on their content and their structure. This problem is covered in detail in Chapter 13.
mir-0078	4.4.3    Hierarchical Structure An intermediate structuring model which lies between fixed structure and hypertext is the hierarchical structure. This model represents a recursive decomposition of the text and is a natural model for many text collections (e.g., books, articles, legal documents, structured programs, etc.). Figure 4.3 shows an example of such a hierarchical structure. The simplification from hypertext to a hierarchy allows the adoption of faster algorithms to solve queries. As a general rule, the more powerful the model, the less efficiently it can be implemented. Our aim in this section is to analyze and discuss the different approaches presented by the hierarchical models. We first present a selection of the most representative models and then discuss the main subjects of this area.

The structure is assumed to be marked in the text by tags (as in HTML), and therefore is defined in terms of initial and final tags. This allows a dynamic scheme where the structure of interest is not fixed but can be determined at query time. For instance, since tags need not to be especially designed as normal tags, one can define that the end-of-lines are the marks in order to define a structure on lines. This also allows for a very efficient implementation and no additional space overhead for the structure. Each pair of initial and final tags defines a region, which is a set of contiguous text areas. Externally computed regions are also supported. However, the areas of a region cannot nest or overlap, which is quite restrictive. There is no restriction on areas of different regions. Apart from text searching operations, it is possible to select areas containing (or not) other areas, contained (or not) in other areas, or followed (or not) by other areas. A disadvantage is that the algebra mixes regions and sets of text positions which are incompatible and force complex conversion semantics. For instance, if the result of a query is going to generate overlapping areas (a fact that cannot be determined beforehand) then the result is converted to positions. Also, the dynamic definition of regions is flexible but requires the structure to be express-able using tags (also called 'markup', see Chapter 6), which for instance does not occur in some structured programming languages. Overlapped Lists These can be seen as an evolution of PAT Expressions. The model allows for the areas of a region to overlap, but not to nest. This elegantly solves the problems of mixing regions and sets of positions. The model considers the use of an inverted list (see Chapter 8) where not only the words but also the regions are indexed. Apart from the operations of PAT Expressions, the model allows us to perform set union, and to combine regions. Combination means selecting the minimal text areas which include any two areas taken from two regions. A 'followed by' operator imposes the additional restriction that the first area must be before the second one. An kn words' operator generates the region of all (overlapping) sequences of n words of the text (this is further used to retrieve elements close to each other). If an operation produces a region with nested areas, only the minimal areas are selected. An example is shown in Figure 2.11. The implementation of this model can also be very efficient. It is not clear, however, whether overlapping is good or not for capturing the structural properties that information has in practice. A new proposal allows the structure to be nested and overlapped, showing that more interesting operators can still be implemented. STRUCTURAL QUERIES         111 Lists of References These are an attempt to make the definition and querying of structured text uniform, using a common language. The language goes beyond querying structured text, so we restrict our attention to the subset in which we are interested. The structure of documents is fixed and hierarchical, which makes it impossible to have overlapping results. All possible regions are defined at indexing time. The answers delivered are more restrictive, since nesting is not allowed (only the top-level elements qualify) and all elements must be of the same type, e.g. only sections, or only paragraphs. In fact, there are also hypertext links but these cannot be queried (the model also has navigational features). A static hierarchical structure makes it possible to speak in terms of direct ancestry of nodes, a concept difficult to express when the structure is dynamic. The language allows for querying on 'path expressions,' which describe paths in the structure tree. Answers to queries are seen as lists of 'references.' A reference is a pointer to a region of the database. This integrates in an elegant way answers to queries and hypertext links, since all are lists of references. Proximal Nodes This model tries to find a good compromise between expressiveness and efficiency. It does not define a specific language, but a model in which it is shown that a number of useful operators can be included achieving good efficiency. The structure is fixed and hierarchical. However, many independent structures can be defined on the same text, each one being a strict hierarchy but allowing overlaps between areas of different hierarchies. An example is shown in Figure 2.12. A query can relate different hierarchies, but returns a subset of the nodes of one hierarchy only (i.e., nested elements are allowed in the answers, but no overlaps). Text matching queries are modeled as returning nodes from a special 'text hierarchy.' The model specifies a fully compositional language where the leaves of the query syntax tree are formed by basic queries on contents or names of structural elements (e.g., all chapters). The internal nodes combine results. For efficiency, the operations defined at the internal nodes must be implementable looking at the identity and text areas of the operands, and must relate nodes which are close in the text. It has been shown that many useful operators satisfy this restriction: selecting elements that (directly or transitively) include or are included in others; that are included at a given position (e.g., the third paragraph of each chapter); that are shortly before or after others; set manipulation; and many powerful variations. Operations on content elements deliver a set of regions with no nesting, and those results can be fully integrated into any query. This ability to integrate the text into the model is very useful. On the other hand, some queries requiring non-proximal operations are not allowed, for instance semijoins. An example of a semijoin is 'give me the titles of all the chapters referenced in this chapter/ 112        QUERY LANGUAGES Tree Matching This model relies on a single primitive: tree inclusion, whose main idea is as follows. Interpreting the structure both of the text database and of the query (which is defined as a pattern on the structure) as trees, determine an embedding of the query into the database which respects the hierarchical relationships between nodes of the query. Two variants are studied. Ordered inclusion forces the embedding to respect the left-to-right relations among siblings in the query, while unordered inclusion does not. The leaves of the query can be not only structural elements but also text patterns, meaning that the ancestor of the leaf must contain that pattern. Simple queries return the roots of the matches. The language is enriched by Prolog-like variables, which can be used to express requirements on equality between parts of the matched substructure and to retrieve another part of the match, not only the root. Logical variables are also used for union and intersection of queries, as well as to emulate tuples and join capabilities. Although the language is set oriented, the algorithms work by sequentially obtaining each match. The use of logical variables and unordered inclusion makes the search problem intractable (NP-hard in many cases). Even the good cases have an inefficient solution in practice. Discussion A survey of the main hierarchical models raises a number of interesting issues, most of them largely unresolved up to now. Some of them are listed below. Static or dynamic structure As seen, in a static structure there are one or more explicit hierarchies (which can be queried, e.g., by ancestry), while in a dynamic structure there is not really a hierarchy, but the required elements are built on the fly. A dynamic structure is implemented over a normal text index, while a static one may or may not be. A static structure is independent of the text markup, while a dynamic one is more flexible for building arbitrary structures. Restrictions on the structure The text or the answers may have restrictions about nesting and/or overlapping. In some cases these restrictions exist for efficiency reasons. In other cases, the query language is restricted to avoid restricting the structure.   This choice is largely dependent on the needs of each application. Integration with text In many structured models, the text content is merely seen as a secondary source of information which is used only to restrict the matches of structural elements. In classic IR models, on the other side, information on the structure is the secondaxv element which is used onlv to restrict text matches. For an effective QUERY PROTOCOLS         113 integration of queries on text content with queries on text structure, the query language must provide for full expressiveness of both types of queries and for effective means of combining them. Query language Typical queries on structure allow the selection of areas that contain (or not) other areas, that are contained (or not) in other areas, that follow (or are followed by) other areas, that are close to other areas, and set manipulation. Many of them are implemented in most models, although each model has unique features. Some kind of standardization, expressiveness taxonomy, or formal categorization would be highly desirable but does not exist yet.
mir-0079	4.5    Query Protocols In this section we briefly cover some query languages that are used automatically by software applications to query text databases. Some of them are proposed as standards for querying CD-ROMs or as intermediate languages to query library systems. Because they are not intended for human use, we refer to them as protocols rather than languages. More information on protocols can be found in Chapters 14 and 15. The most important query protocols are: ï  Z39.50 is a protocol approved as a standard in 1995 by ANSI and NISO. This protocol is intended to query bibliographical information using a standard interface between the client and the host database manager which is independent of the client user interface and of the query database language at the host. The database is assumed to be a text collection with some fixed fields (although it is more flexible than usual). The Z39.50 protocol is used broadly and is part, for instance, of WAIS (see below). The protocol does not only specify the query language and its semantics, but also the way in which client and server establish a session, communicate and exchange information, etc.   Although originally conceived only to operate on bibliographical information (using the Machine Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) format), it has been extended to query other types of information as well. ï  WAIS   (Wide Area Information Service) is a suite of protocols that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s before the boom of the Web.  The goal of WAIS was to be a network publishing protocol and to be able to query databases through the Internet. In the CD-ROM publishing arena, there are several proposals for query protocols. The main goal of these protocols is to provide 'disk interchangeability." This means more flexibility in data communication between primary information providers and end users. It also enables significant cost savings since it allows access to diverse information without the need to buy, install, and train users for different data retrieval applications. We briefly cover three of these proposals: 114        QUERY LANGUAGES Æ CCL (Common Command Language) is a NISO proposal (Z39.58 or ISO 8777) based on Z39.50. It defines 19 commands that can be used interactively. It is more popular in Europe, although very few products use it. It is based on the classical Boolean model. ï  CD-RDx   (Compact Disk Read only Data exchange) uses a client-server architecture and has been implemented in most platforms.   The client is generic while the server is designed and provided by the CD-ROM publisher who includes it with the database in the CD-ROM. It allows fixed-length fields, images, and audio, and is supported by such US national agencies as the CIA, NASA, and GSA. ï  SFQL   (Structured Full-text Query Language) is based on SQL and also has a client-server architecture. SFQL has been adopted as a standard by the aerospace community (the Air Transport Association/Aircraft Industry Association). Documents are rows in a relational table and can be tagged using SGML. The language defines the format of the answer, which has a header and a variable length message area. The language does not define any specific formatting or markup. For example, a query in SFQL is: Select abstract from journal.papers where title contains  "text search" The language supports Boolean and logical operators, thesaurus, proximity operations, and some special characters such as wild cards and repetition. For example: where paper contains  "retrieval"  or like  "info ï/," and date gt; 1/1/98 Compared with CCL or CD-RDx, SFQL is more general and flexible, although it is based on a relational model, which is not always the best choice for a document database.
mir-0080	4.6    Trends and Research Issues We reviewed in this chapter the main aspects of the query languages that retrieve information from textual databases. Our discussion covered from the most classic tools to the most novel capabilities that are emerging, from searching words to extended patterns, from the Boolean model to querying structures. Table 4.1 shows the different basic queries allowed in the different models. Although the probabilistic and the Bayesian belief network (BBN) models are based on word queries, they can incorporate set operations. We present in Figure 4.4 the types of operations we covered and how they can be structured (not all of them exist in all models and not ail of them have to be used to form a query). The figure shows, for instance, that we can form a query using Boolean operations over phrases (skipping structural queries), which TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES 115 Model	Queries allowed Boolean	word, set operations Vector	words Probabilistic	words BBN	words Table 4.1    Relationship between types of queries and models. can be formed by words and by regular expressions (skipping the ability to allow errors). natural language Boolean queries fuzzy Boolean structural queries proximity basic queries pattern matching words keywords and context substrings prefixes suffixes regular expressions extended patterns Figure 4.4    The types of queries covered and how they are structured. The area of query languages for text databases is definitely moving towards higher flexibility. While text models are moving towards the goal of achieving a better understanding of the user needs (by providing relevance feedback, for instance), the query languages are allowing more and more power in the specification of the query. While extended patterns and searching allowing errors permit us to find patterns without complete knowledge of what is wanted, querying on the structure of the text (and not only on its content) provides greater expressiveness and increased functionality. Another important research topic is visual query languages. Visual metaphors can help non-experienced users to pose complex Boolean queries. Also, a visual query language can include the structure of the document. This topic is related to user interfaces arid visualization and is covered in Chapter 10. 116        QUERY LANGUAGES

mir-0083	5.1    Introduction Without detailed knowledge of the collection make-up and of the retrieval environment, most users find it difficult to formulate queries which are well designed for retrieval purposes. In fact, as observed with Web search engines, the users might need to spend large amounts of time reformulating their queries to accomplish effective retrieval. This difficulty suggests that the first query formulation should be treated as an initial (naive) attempt to retrieve relevant information. Following that, the documents initially retrieved could be examined for relevance and new improved query formulations could then be constructed in the hope of retrieving additional useful documents. Such query reformulation involves two basic steps: expanding the original query with new terms and reweighting the terms in the expanded query. In this chapter, we examine a variety of approaches for improving the initial query formulation through query expansion and term reweighting. These approaches are grouped in three categories: (a) approaches based on feedback information from the user; (b) approaches based on information derived from the set of documents initially retrieved (called the local set of documents); and (c) approaches based on global information derived from the document collection. In the first category, user relevance feedback methods for the vector and probabilistic models are discussed. In the second category, two approaches for local analysis (i.e., analysis based on the set of documents initially retrieved) are presented. In the third category, two approaches for global analysis are covered. Our discussion is not aimed at completely covering the area, neither does it intend to present an exhaustive survey of query operations. Instead, our discussion is based on a selected bibliography which, we believe, is broad enough to allow an overview of the main issues and tradeoffs involved in query operations. Local and global analysis are highly dependent on clustering algorithms. Thus, clustering is covered throughout our discussion. However, there is no intention of providing a complete survey of clustering algorithms for information retrieval. 117 118        QUERY OPERATIONS
mir-0084	5-2    User Relevance Feedback Relevance feedback is the most popular query reformulation strategy. In a relevance feedback cycle, the user is presented with a list of the retrieved documents and, after examining them, marks those which are relevant. In practice, only the top 10 (or 20) ranked documents need to be examined. The main idea consists of selecting important terms, or expressions, attached to the documents that have been identified as relevant by the user, and of enhancing the importance of these terms in a new query formulation. The expected effect is that the new query will be moved towards the relevant documents and away from the non-relevant ones. Early experiments using the Smart system [695] and later experiments using the probabilistic weighting model [677] have shown good improvements in precision for small test collections when relevance feedback is used. Such improvements come from the use of two basic techniques: query expansion (addition of new terms from relevant documents) and term reweighting (modification of term weights based on the user relevance judgement). Relevance feedback presents the following main advantages over other query reformulation strategies: (a) it shields the user from the details of the query reformulation process because all the user has to provide is a relevance judgement on documents; (b) it breaks down the whole searching task into a sequence of small steps which are easier to grasp; and (c) it provides a controlled process designed to emphasize some terms (relevant ones) and de-emphasize others (non-relevant ones). In the following three subsections, we discuss the usage of user relevance feedback to (a) expand queries with the vector model, (b) reweight query terms with the probabilistic model, and (c) reweight query terms with a variant of the probabilistic model.
mir-0085	5.2.1    Query Expansion and Term Reweighting for the Vector Model The application of relevance feedback to the vector model considers that the term-weight vectors of the documents identified as relevant (to a given query) have similarities among themselves (i.e., relevant documents resemble each other). Further, it is assumed that non-relevant documents have term-weight vectors which are dissimilar from the ones for the relevant documents. The basic idea is to reformulate the query such that it gets closer to the term-weight vector space of the relevant documents. Let us define some additional terminology regarding the processing of a given query q as follows, Dr: set of relevant documents, as identified by the user, among the retrieved documents; Dn: set of non-relevant documents among the retrieved documents; Cr: set of relevant documents among all documents in the collection; USER RELEVANCE FEEDBACK         119 |Z)r|, |Dn|, \Cr\:   number of documents in the sets Dr, Dni and Cr, respectively; a,/?, 7: tuning constants. Consider first the unrealistic situation in which the complete set Cr of relevant documents to a given query q is known in advance. In such a situation, it can be demonstrated that the best query vector for distinguishing the relevant documents from the non-relevant documents is given by, The problem with this formulation is that the relevant documents which compose the set Cr are not known a priori. In fact, we are looking for them. The natural way to avoid this problem is to formulate an initial query and to incrementally change the initial query vector. This incremental change is accomplished by restricting the computation to the documents known to be relevant (according to the user judgement) at that point. There are three classic and similar ways to calculate the modified query qm as follows, Standard JRochio :    qm    = a q + ]P   dj VdjEDr Ide-Regular :    qm    = a q + (3   ^    dj   ó 7 \fd3eDr Ide^Dec^Hi :    qm    = a q +  j3   ^    d3   -  7   maxnon_Teievani{d]) where maxnon-reievant(dj) is a reference to the highest ranked non-relevant document. Notice that now Dr and Dn stand for the sets of relevant and non-relevant documents (among the retrieved ones) according to the user judgement, respectively. In the original formulations, Rochio [678] fixed a = 1 and Ide [391] fixed a = ft = 7 = 1. The expressions above are modern variants. The current understanding is that the three techniques yield similar results (in the past, Ide Dec-Hi was considered slightly better). The Rochio formulation is basically a direct adaptation of equation 5.1 in which the terms of the original query are added in. The motivation is that in practice the original query q may contain important information. Usually, the information contained in the relevant documents is more important than the information provided by the non-relevant documents [698]. This suggests making the constant 7 smaller than the constant /3. An alternative approach is to set ~ to 0 which yields a positive feedback strategy. The main advantages of the above relevance feedback techniques are simplicity and good results. The simplicity is due to the fact that the modified term weights are computed directly from the set of retrieved documents.  The good 120       QUERY OPERATIONS results are observed experimentally and are due to the fact that the modified query vector does reflect a portion of the intended query semantics. The main disadvantage is that no optimality criterion is adopted.
mir-0086	5.2.2    Term Reweighting for the Probabilistic Model The probabilistic model dynamically ranks documents similar to a query q according to the probabilistic ranking principle. Prom Chapter 2, we already know that the similarity of a document dj to a query q can be expressed as 2=1 szm(d^q) a V wUq wid     log       v   J   '     + log     p^ -              (5.2) l-P(kt\R)        *    P(ki\R) where P(fci|i?) stands for the probability of observing the term k{ in the set R of relevant documents and P(ki\R) stands for the probability of observing the term k{ in the set R of non-relevant documents. Initially, equation 5.2 cannot be used because the probabilities P(kl\R) and P(kt\R) are unknown. A number of different methods for estimating these probabilities automatically (i.e., without feedback from the user) were discussed in Chapter 2. With user feedback information, these probabilities are estimated in a slightly different way as follows. For the initial search (when there are no retrieved documents yet), assumptions often made include: (a) P(ki\R) is constant for all terms ki (typically 0.5) and (b) the term probability distribution P(ki\R) can be approximated by the distribution in the whole collection. These two assumptions yield: P{k{\R)   =   0.5 where, as before, nt stands for the number of documents in the collection which contain the term k(. Substituting into equation 5.2, we obtain t                                            AT f ,     N     v^              ,     iv-rii sirriin^iaiidj.q) ~ x     ......     1-i For the feedback searches, the accumulated statistics related to the relevance or non-relevance of previously retrieved documents are used to evaluate the probabilities P(ki\R) and P(ki\~R). As before, let Dr be the set of relevant retrieved documents (according to the user judgement) and Drj be the subset of DT composed of the documents which contain the term k{. Then, the probabilities P(ki\R) and P(ki\R) can be approximated by (5.3) USER RELEVANCE FEEDBACK        121 Using these approximations, equation 5.2 can rewritten as r      \Dr,i\                  n,-\Dr,i\ Notice that here, contrary to the procedure in the vector space model, no query expansion occurs. The same query terms are being reweighted using feedback information provided by the user. Formula 5.3 poses problems for certain small values of \Dr\ and \Dr^\ that frequently arise in practice (\Dr\ = 1, \Dr^\ = 0). For this reason, a 0.5 adjustment factor is often added to the estimation of P(kt\R) and P(ki\R) yielding This 0.5 adjustment factor may provide unsatisfactory estimates in some cases, and alternative adjustments have been proposed such as rii/N or (n^ ó |Dr,z|) /{N - \Dr\) [843]. Taking rii/N as the adjustment factor (instead of 0.5), equation 5.4 becomes )-    N-\Dr\+l The main advantages of this relevance feedback procedure are that the feedback process is directly related to the derivation of new weights for query terms and that the term reweighting is optimal under the assumptions of term independence and binary document indexing (wi,q Ä {0,1} and u^j Ä {0,1}). The disadvantages include: (1) document term weights are not taken into account during the feedback loop; (2) weights of terms in the previous query formulations are also disregarded; and (3) no query expansion is used (the same set of index terms in the original query is reweighted over and over again). As a result of these disadvantages, the probabilistic relevance feedback methods do not in general operate as effectively as the conventional vector modification methods. To extend the probabilistic model with query expansion capabilities, different approaches have been proposed in the literature ranging from term weighting for query expansion to term clustering techniques based on spanning trees. All of these approaches treat probabilistic query expansion separately from probabilistic term reweighting. While we do not discuss them here, a brief history of research on this issue and bibliographical references can be found in section 5.6.
mir-0087	5.2.3    A Variant of Probabilistic Term Reweighting The discussion above on term reweighting is based on the classic probabilistic niodel introduced by Robertson and Sparck Jones in 1976. In 1983, Croft extended this weighting scheme by suggesting distinct initial search methods 122        QUERY OPERATIONS and by adapting the probabilistic formula to include within-document frequency weights. This variant of probabilistic term reweighting is more flexible (and also more powerful) and is briefly reviewed in this section. The formula 5.2 for probabilistic ranking can be rewritten as sim(dj,q) a where Fij,q is interpreted as a factor which depends on the triple [K,d3,q]. In the classic formulation, FMilt;7 is computed as a function of P(ki\R) and P(kt\R) (see equation 5.2). In his variant, Croft proposed that the initial search and the feedback searches use distinct formulations. For the initial search, he suggested Juj    = max(fij) where fx j is a normalized within-document frequency. The parameters C and K should be adjusted according to the collection. For automatically indexed collections, C should be initially set to 0. For the feedback searches, Croft suggested the following formulation for F.        fc I log   P(W     iloc1^*'^   7 IJlt;9"VC+   gl-P(h\R) +1∞g    P(kt\R)   )   ^ where P(kt\R) and P{kt\R) are computed as in equation 5.4. This variant of probabilistic term reweighting has the following advantages: (1) it takes into account the within-document frequencies; (2) it adopts a normalized version of these frequencies; and (3) it introduces the constants C and K which provide for greater flexibility. However, it constitutes a more complex formulation and, as before, it operates solely on the terms originally in the query (without query expansion).
mir-0088	5.2.4    Evaluation of Relevance Feedback Strategies Consider the modified query vector qm generated by the Rochio formula and assume that we want to evaluate its retrieval performance. A simplistic approach is to retrieve a set of documents using qm, to rank them using the vector formula, and to measure recall-precision figures relative to the set of relevant documents (provided by the experts) for the original query vector q. In general, the results siiow spectacular improvements. Unfortunately, a significant part of this improvement results from the higher ranks assigned to the set R of documents AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS        123 already identified as relevant during the feedback process [275]. Since the user has seen these documents already (and pointed them as relevants), such evaluation is unrealistic. Further, it masks any real gains in retrieval performance due to documents not seen by the user yet. A more realistic approach is to evaluate the retrieval performance of the modified query vector qm considering only the residual collection i.e., the set of all documents minus the set of feedback documents provided by the user. Because highly ranked documents are removed from the collection, the recall-precision figures for qm tend to be lower than the figures for the original query vector q. This is not a limitation because our main purpose is to compare the performance of distinct relevance feedback strategies (and not to compare the performance before and after feedback). Thus, as a basic rule of thumb, any experimentation involving relevance feedback strategies should always evaluate recall-precision figures relative to the residual collection.
mir-0089	5.3    Automatic Local Analysis In a user relevance feedback cycle, the user examines the top ranked documents and separates them into two classes: the relevant ones and the non-relevant ones. This information is then used to select new terms for query expansion. The reasoning is that the expanded query will retrieve more relevant documents. Thus, there is an underlying notion of clustering supporting the feedback strategy. According to this notion, known relevant documents contain terms which can be used to describe a larger cluster of relevant documents. In this case, the description of this larger cluster of relevant documents is built interactively with assistance from the user. A distinct approach is to attempt to obtain a description for a larger cluster of relevant documents automatically. This usually involves identifying terms which are related to the query terms. Such terms might be synonyms, stemming variations, or terms which are close to the query terms in the text (i.e., terms with a distance of at most k words from a query term). Two basic types of strategies can be attempted: global ones and local ones. In a global strategy, all documents in the collection are used to determine a global thesaurus-like structure which defines term relationships. This structure is then shown to the user who selects terms for query expansion. Global strategies are discussed in section 5.4. In a local strategy, the documents retrieved for a given query q are examined at query time to determine terms for query expansion. This is similar to a relevance feedback cycle but might be done without assistance from the user (i.e., the approach might be fully automatic). Two local strategies are discussed below: local clustering and local context analysis. The first is based on the work done by Attar and Fraenkel in 1977 and is used here to establish many of the fundamental ideas and concepts regarding the usage of clustering for query expansion. The second is a recent work done by Xu and Croft in 1996 and illustrates the advantages of combining techniques from both local and global analysis. 124        QUERY OPERATIONS
mir-0090	5.3.1    Query Expansion Through Local Clustering Adoption of clustering techniques for query expansion is a basic approach which has been attempted since the early years of information retrieval. The standard approach is to build global structures such as association matrices which quantify term correlations (for instance, number of documents in which two given terms co-occur) and to use correlated terms for query expansion. The main problem with this strategy is that there is not consistent evidence that global structures can be used effectively to improve retrieval performance with general collections. One main reason seems to be that global structures do not adapt well to the local context defined by the current query. One approach to deal with this effect is to devise strategies which aim at optimizing the current search. Such strategies are based on local clustering and are now discussed. Our discussion is based on the original work by Attar and Praenkel which appeared in 1977. We first define basic terminology as follows. Definition Let V(s) be a non-empty subset of words which are grammatical variants of each other. A canonical form s ofV(s) is called a stem. For instance, if V(s)={polish,polishing,polished} then $=polish. For a detailed discussion on stemming algorithms see Chapter 7. While stems are adopted in our discussion, the ideas below are also valid for non-stemmed keywords. We proceed with a characterization of the local nature of the strategies covered here. Definition For a given query q, the set D\ of documents retrieved is called the local document set Further, the set V/ of all distinct words in the local document set is called the local vocabulary. The set of all distinct stems derived from the set Vi is referred to as Si. We operate solely on the documents retrieved for the current query. Since it is frequently necessary to access the text of such documents, the application of local strategies to the Web is unlikely at this time. In fact, at a client machine, retrieving the text of 100 Web documents for local analysis would take too long, reducing drastically the interactive nature of Web interfaces and the satisfaction of the users. Further, at the search engine site, analyzing the text of 100 Web documents would represent an extra spending of CPU time which is not cost effective at this time (because search engines depend on processing a high number of queries per unit of time for economic survival). However, local strategies might be quite useful in the environment of intranets such as, for instance, the collection of documents issued by a large business company. Further, local strategies might also be of great assistance for searching information in specialized document collections (for instance, medical document collections). Local feedback strategies are based on expanding the query with terms correlated to the query terms. Such correlated terms are those present in local dusters built from the local document set.   Thus, before we discuss local AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS        125 query expansion, we discuss strategies for building local clusters. Three types of clusters are covered: association clusters, metric clusters, and scalar clusters. Association Clusters An association cluster is based on the co-occurrence of stems (or terms) inside documents. The idea is that stems which co-occur frequently inside documents have a synonymity association. Association clusters are generated as follows. Definition The frequency of a stem Si in a document dj, dj G Di, is referred to as fs,L,j- Let m=(mij) be an association matrix with \Si\ rows and \Di\ columns, where mlJ=fs%j. Let fhl be the transpose of m. The matrix s=mfht is a local stem-stem association matrix. Each element su^v in s expresses a correlation cu,v between the stems $u and sv namely, The correlation factor cUiV quantifies the absolute frequencies of co-occurrence and is said to be unnormalized. Thus, if we adopt su,v = cu,v                                                                                                      (5.6) then the association matrix s is said to be unnormalized.  An alternative is to normalize the correlation factor. For instance, if we adopt then the association matrix s is said to be normalized. The adoption of normalization yields quite distinct associations as discussed below. Given a local association matrix s, we can use it to build local association clusters as follows. Definition Consider the u-th row in the association matrix s (i.e., the row with all the associations for the stem su). Let Su(n) be a function which takes the u-th row and returns the set of n largest values sUiV1 where v varies over the set of local stems and v ^ u.  Then Su(n) defines a local association cluster around the stem su. If su,v is given by equation 5.6, the association cluster is said to be unnormalized. If su^v is given by equation 5.7f the association cluster is said to be normalized. Given a query q, we are normally interested in finding clusters only for the \q\ query terms. Further, it is desirable to keep the size of such clusters small This means that such clusters can be computed efficiently at query time. 126        QUERY OPERATIONS Despite the fact that the above clustering procedure adopts stems, it can equally be applied to non-stemmed keywords. The procedure remains unchanged except for the usage of keywords instead of stems. Keyword-based local clustering is equally worthwhile trying because there is controversy over the advantages of using a stemmed vocabulary, as discussed in Chapter 7. Metric Clusters Association clusters are based on the frequency of co-occurrence of pairs of terms in documents and do not take into account where the terms occur in a document. Since two terms which occur in the same sentence seem more correlated than two terms which occur far apart in a document, it might be worthwhile to factor in the distance between two terms in the computation of their correlation factor. Metric clusters are based on this idea. Definition Let the distance r(kt,kj) between two keywords kt and k3 be given by the number of words between them in a same document. If k2 and k3 are in distinct documents we take r(ki,kj) = oo. A local stem-stem metric correlation matrix s is defined as follows. Each element su,v of s expresses a metric correlation cu,v between the stems su and sv namely; In this expression, as already defined, V(su) and V(sv) indicate the sets of keywords which have su and sv as their respective stems. Variations of the above expression for cu,L. have been reported in the literature (such as l/r2(ki, kj)) but the differences in experimental results are not remarkable. The correlation factor cu^v quantifies absolute inverse distances and is said to be unnormalized. Thus, if we adopt then the association matrix s is said to be unnormalized.  An alternative is to normalize the correlation factor. For instance, if we adopt (5.9) u'v     |V'(M| x \V(sv)\ then the association matrix sis said to be normalized. Given a local metric matrix s*. we can use it to build local metric clusters as follows. Definition     Consider the u-th row in the metric correlation matrix s (i.e., the row with all the associations for tht stern su).   Let Su(n) be a function which AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS         127 takes the u-th row and returns the set of n largest values su^v, where v varies over the set of local stems and v ^ u. Then Su(n) defines a local metric cluster around the stem su. If su,v is given by equation 5.8, the metric cluster is said to be unnormalized. If su^v is given by equation 5.9, the metric cluster is said to be normalized. ScaSar Clusters One additional form of deriving a synonymity relationship between two local stems (or terms) su and sv is by comparing the sets Su(n) and Sv(n). The idea is that two stems with similar neighborhoods have some synonymity relationship. In this case we say that the relationship is indirect or induced by the neighborhood. One way of quantifying such neighborhood relationships is to arrange all correlation values su^ in a vector su, to arrange all correlation values sVil in another vector svi and to compare these vectors through a scalar measure. For instance, the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is a popular scalar similarity measure. Definition Let su = (su,i, su$-gt; ï ï ï 1 su,n) and sv = (sw,i, sL,,2, ï - ï, Sy,n) be two vectors of correlation values for the stems su and sv. Further, let s = {su%v) be a scalar association matrix.  Then, each su^v can be defined as \SU\  X  Kl The correlation matrix sis said to be induced by the neighborhood. Using it. a scalar cluster is then defined as follows. Definition Let Su(n) be a function which returns the set of n largest values su,v, v y£ u7 defined according to equation 5.10. Then, Su{n) defines a scalar cluster around the stem su. Interactive Search Formulation Stems (or terms) that belong to clusters associated to the query stems (or terms) can be used to expand the original query. Such stems are called neighbors (of the query stems) and are characterized as follows. A stem su which belongs to a cluster (of size n) associated to another stem sv (i.e., su G Sv(n)) is said to be a neighbor of sv. Sometimes, su is also called a searchonym of sv but here we opt for using the terminology neighbor. While neighbor sterns are said to have a synonymity relationship, they are not necessarily synonyms in the grammatical sense. Often, neighbor steins represent distinct keywords which are though correlated by the current query context. The local aspect of this correlation is reflected in the fact that the documents and stems considered in the correlation matrix are all local (i.e., dj E Alt; su Ä V}). 128        QUERY OPERATIONS Figure 5.1    Stem su as a neighbor of the stem sv. Figure 5.1 illustrates a stem (or term) su which is located within a neighborhood Sv(n) associated with the stem (or term) sv. In its broad meaning, neighbor stems are an important product of the local clustering process since they can be used for extending a search formulation in a promising unexpected direction, rather than merely complementing it with missing synonyms. Consider the problem of expanding a given user query q with neighbor stems (or terms). One possibility is to expand the query as follows. For each stem sv Ä q, select m neighbor stems from the cluster Sv(n) (which might be of type association, metric, or scalar) and add them to the query. Hopefully, the additional neighbor stems will retrieve new relevant documents. To cover a broader neighborhood, the set Sv(n) might be composed of stems obtained using correlation factors (i.e., cUilgt;) normalized and unnormalized. The qualitative interpretation is that an unnormalized cluster tends to group stems whose ties are due to their large frequencies, while a normalized cluster tends to group stems which are more rare. Thus, the union of the two clusters provides a better representation of the possible correlations. Besides the merging of normalized and unnormalized clusters, one can also use information about correlated stems to improve the search. For instance, as before, let two stems $u and sv be correlated with a correlation factor cu,v. If cu,v is larger than a predefined threshold then a neighbor stem of su can also be interpreted as a neighbor stem of sv and vice versa. This provides greater flexibility, particularly with Boolean queries. To illustrate, consider the expression (su -f sv) where the + symbol stands for disjunction- Let su* be a neighbor stem of su. Then, one can try both (sugt; + sv) and (su-t-su') as synonym search expressions, because of the correlation given by cu^v. AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANALYSIS         129 Experimental results reported in the literature usually support the hypothesis of the usefulness of local clustering methods. Furthermore, metric clusters seem to perform better than purely association clusters. This strengthens the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the association of two terms and the distance between them. We emphasize that all the qualitative arguments in this section are explicitly based on the fact that all the clusters are local (i.e., derived solely from the documents retrieved for the current query). In a global context, clusters are derived from all the documents in the collection which implies that our qualitative argumentation might not stand. The main reason is that correlations valid in the whole corpora might not be valid for the current query.
mir-0091	5.3.2    Query Expansion Through Local Context Analysis The local clustering techniques discussed above are based on the set of documents retrieved for the original query and use the top ranked documents for clustering neighbor terms (or stems). Such a clustering is based on term (stems were considered above) co-occurrence inside documents. Terms which are the best neighbors of each query term are then used to expand the original query q. A distinct approach is to search for term correlations in the whole collection ó an approach called global analysis. Global techniques usually involve the building of a thesaurus which identifies term relationships in the whole collection. The terms are treated as concepts and the thesaurus is viewed as a concept relationship structure. Thesauri are expensive to build but, besides providing support for query expansion, are useful as a browsing tool as demonstrated by some search engines in the Web. The building of a thesaurus usually considers the use of small contexts and phrase structures instead of simply adopting the context provided by a whole document. Furthermore, with modern variants of global analysis, terms which are closest to the whole query (and not to individual query terms) are selected for query expansion. The application of ideas from global analysis (such as small contexts and phrase structures) to the local set of documents retrieved is a recent idea which we now discuss. Local context analysis [838] combines global and local analysis and works as follows. First, the approach is based on the use of noun groups (i.e., a single noun, two adjacent nouns, or three adjacent nouns in the text), instead of simple keywords, as document concepts. For query expansion, concepts are selected froiri the top ranked documents (as in local analysis) based on their co-occurrence with query terms (no stemming). However, instead of documents, passages (i.e., a text window of fixed size) are used for determining co-occurrence (as in global analysis). More specifically, the local context analysis procedure operates in three steps. ï First, retrieve the top n ranked passages using the original query.   This is accomplished by breaking up the documents initially retrieved by the 130        QUERY OPERATIONS query in fixed length passages (for instance, of size 300 words) and ranking these passages as if they were documents. ï  Second, for each concept c in the top ranked passages, the similarity sirn(q)c) between the whole query q (not individual query terms) and the concept c is computed using a variant of tf-idf ranking. ï  Third, the top m ranked concepts (according to sim(q,c)) are added to the original query q. To each added concept is assigned a weight given by 1 ó 0.9 x i/m where i is the position of the concept in the final concept ranking. The terms in the original query q might be stressed by assigning a weight equal to 2 to each of them. Of these three steps, the second one is the most complex and the one which we now discuss. The similarity sim(q, c) between each related concept c and the original query q is computed as follows.  where n is the number of top ranked passages considered. The function /(c, ki) quantifies the correlation between the concept c and the query term fcj and is given by where pfij is the frequency of term k2 in the j-th passage and pfCiJ is the frequency of the concept c in the j-th passage. Notice that this is the standard correlation measure defined for association clusters (by Equation 5.5) but adapted for passages. The inverse document frequency factors are computed as idjx    =    mar(l,ó  where Ar is the number of passages in the collection, npt is the number of passages containing the term kv and npc is the number of passages containing the concept c. The factor 5 is a constant parameter which avoids a value equal to zero for sirn(q,c) (which is useful, for instance, if the approach is to be used with probabilistic frameworks such as that provided by belief networks). Usually, 8 is a small factor with values close to 0.1 (10% of the maximum of 1). Finally, the idft factor in the exponent is introduced to emphasize infrequent query terms. The procedure above for computing sirniq.c) is a non-trivial variant of tf-idf ranking.  Furthermore, it lias been adjusted for operation with TREC data AUTOMATIC GLOBAL ANALYSIS        131 and did not work so well with a different collection. Thus, it is important to have in mind that tuning might be required for operation with a different collection. We also notice that the correlation measure adopted with local context analysis is of type association. However, we already know that a correlation of type metric is expected to be more effective. Thus, it remains to be tested whether the adoption of a metric correlation factor (for the function /(c, fe^)) makes any difference with local context analysis.
mir-0092	5.4    Automatic Global Analysis The methods of local analysis discussed above extract information from the local set of documents retrieved to expand the query. It is well accepted that such a procedure yields improved retrieval performance with various collections. An alternative approach is to expand the query using information from the whole set of documents in the collection. Strategies based on this idea are called global analysis procedures. Until the beginning of the 1990s, global analysis was considered to be a technique which failed to yield consistent improvements in retrieval performance with general collections. This perception has changed with the appearance of modern procedures for global analysis. In the following, we discuss two of these modern variants. Both of them are based on a thesaurus-like structure built using all the documents in the collection. However, the approach taken for building the thesaurus and the procedure for selecting terms for query expansion are quite distinct in the two cases.
mir-0093	5.4.1    Query Expansion based on a Similarity Thesaurus In this section we discuss a query expansion model based on a global similarity thesaurus which is constructed automatically [655]. The similarity thesaurus is based on term to term relationships rather than on a matrix of co-occurrence (as discussed in section 5.3). The distinction is made clear in the discussion below. Furthermore, special attention is paid to the selection of terms for expansion and to the reweighting of these terms. In contrast to previous global analysis approaches, terms for expansion are selected based on their similarity to the whole query rather than on their similarities to individual query terms. A similarity thesaurus is built considering term to term relationships. However, such relationships are not derived directly from co-occurrence of terms inside documents. Rather, they are obtained by considering that the terms are concepts in a concept space. In this concept space, each term is indexed by the documents in which it appears. Thus, terms assume the original role of documents while documents are interpreted as indexing elements. The following definitions establish the proper framework. Definition As before (see Chapter 2), let t he the number of terms in the collection, N be the number of documents in the collection, and fx j be the frequency 132        QUERY OPERATIONS of occurrence of the term k{ in the document dj. Further, let tj be the number of distinct index terms in the document dj and itfj be the inverse term frequency for document dj. Then, t itfj = log ó analogously to the definition of inverse document frequency. Within this framework, to each term k{ is associated a vector fc$ given by where, as in Chapter 2, Wi0 is a weight associated to the index-document pair [ki,dj]. Here, however, these weights are computed in a rather distinct form as follows. where maxj(fij) computes the maximum of all factors /^ for the i-th term (i.e., over all documents in the collection). We notice that the expression above is a variant of tf-idf weights hut one which considers inverse term frequencies instead. The relationship between two terms ku and kv is computed as a correlation factor cu^v given by wuj x wvj                                               (5.12) We notice that this is a variation of the correlation measure used for computing scalar association matrices (defined by Equation 5.5). The main difference is that the weights are based on interpreting documents as indexing elements instead of repositories for term co-occurrence. The global similarity thesaurus is built through the computation of the correlation factor cu,v for each pair of indexing terms [ku,kv] in the collection (analogously to the procedure in section 5.3). Of course, this is computationally expensive. However, this global similarity thesaurus has to be computed only once and can be updated incrementally. Given the global similarity thesaurus, query expansion is done in three steps as follows. ï First, represent the query in the concept space used for representation of the index terms. AUTOMATIC GLOBAL ANALYSIS        133 ï  Second, based on the global similarity thesaurus, compute a similarity sirn(q,kv) between each term kv correlated to the query terms and the whole query q. ï  Third,  expand the query with the top r  ranked terms  according to sim(q, kv). For the first step, the query is represented in the concept space of index term vectors as follows. Definition     To the query q is associated a vector q in the term-concept space given by q= y}Twliqki where Wi,q is a weight associated to the index-query pair [kt,q].   This weight is computed analogously to the index-document weight formula in equation 5.11. For the second step, a similarity sim(q, kv) between each term kv (correlated to the query terms) and the user query q is computed as sim(q,kv) = q- kv = kueQ where cu,v is the correlation factor given in equation 5.12. As illustrated in Figure 5.2, a term might be quite close to the whole query while its distances to individual query terms are larger. This implies that the terms selected here for query expansion might be distinct from those selected by previous global analysis methods (which adopted a similarity to individual query terms for deciding terms for query expansion). For the third step, the top r ranked terms according to sim(q, kv) are added to the original query q to form the expanded query q . To each expansion term kv in the query q is assigned a weight wvq' given by ^ _   sirnjq.ky) Wv,q    ~~ Np The expanded query q is then used to retrieve new documents to the user. This completes the technique for query expansion based on a similarity thesaurus. Contrary to previous global analysis approaches, this technique has yielded improved retrieval performance (in the range of 20%) with three different collections. It is worthwhile making one final observation. Consider a document dj which is represented in the term-concept space by dj = *%2ktÄd u?ij^´- Further, assume that the original query q is expanded to include all tne t index terms 134        QUERY OPERATIONS Q=lKa,Kb) Figure 5.2    The distance of a given term kv to the query centroid Qc might be quite distinct from the distances of kv to the individual query terms. (properly weighted) in the collection.  Then, the similarity sim(q^dj) between the document dj and the query q can be computed in the term-concept space by E vj X wu,q X cu,v Such an expression is analogous to the formula for query-document similarity in the generalized vector space model (see Chapter 2). Thus, the generalized vector space model can be interpreted as a query expansion technique. The main differences with the term-concept idea are the weight computation and the fact that only the top r ranked terms are used for query expansion with the term-concept technique.
mir-0094	5.4.2    Query Expansion based on a Statistical Thesaurus In this section, we discuss a query expansion technique based on a global statistical thesaurus [200], Despite also being a global analysis technique, the approach is quite distinct from the one described above which is based on a similarity thesaurus. The global thesaurus is composed of classes which group correlated terms in the context of the whole collection. Such correlated terms can then be used to expand the original user query. To be effective, the terms selected for expansion must have high term discrimination values [699] which implies that they must be low frequency terms. However, it is difficult to cluster low frequency terms effectively due to the small amount of information, about them (they occur in few documents). To circumvent this problem, we cluster documents into AUTOMATIC GLOBAL ANALYSIS        135 classes instead and use the low frequency terms in these documents to define our thesaurus classes. In this situation, the document clustering algorithm must produce small and tight clusters. A document clustering algorithm which produces small and tight clusters is the complete link algorithm which works as follows (naive formulation). (1)  Initially, place each document in a distinct cluster. (2)  Compute the similarity between all pairs of clusters. (3)  Determine the pair of clusters [CU,CV] with the highest inter-cluster similarity. (4)  Merge the clusters Cu and Cv. (5)  Verify a stop criterion. If this criterion is not met then go back to step 2. (6)  Return a hierarchy of clusters. The similarity between two clusters is defined as the minimum of the similarities between all pairs of inter-cluster documents (i.e., two documents not in the same cluster). To compute the similarity between documents in a pair, the cosine formula of the vector model is used. As a result of this minimality criterion, the resultant clusters tend to be small and tight. Consider that the whole document collection has been clustered using the complete link algorithm. Figure 5.3 illustrates a small portion of the whole cluster hierarchy in which sirn(Cu,Cv) = 0.15 and sim(Cu+v,Cz) =0.11 where CujrV is a reference to the cluster which results from merging Cu and Cv. Notice that the similarities decrease as we move up in the hierarchy because high level clusters include more documents and thus represent a looser grouping. Thus, the tightest clusters lie at the bottom of the clustering hierarchy. Given the document cluster hierarchy for the whole collection, the terms that compose each class of the global thesaurus are selected as follows. ï Obtain from the user three parameters: threshold class (TC), number of Figure  5.3    Hierarchy of three clusters (inter-cluster similarities indicated in the ovals) generated by the complete link algorithm. 136        QUERY OPERATIONS documents in a class (NDC), and minimum inverse document frequency (MIDF). ï  Use the parameter TC as a threshold value for determining the document clusters that will be used to generate thesaurus classes. This threshold has to be surpassed by sim(CU} Cv) if the documents in the clusters Cu and Cv are to be selected as sources of terms for a thesaurus class. For instance, in Figure 5.3, a value of 0.14 for TC returns the thesaurus class Cu+V while a value of 0.10 for TC returns the classes Cu+V and Cu+V+Z. ï  Use the parameter NDC as a limit on the size of clusters (number of documents) to be considered.   For instance, if both Cu+V and Cu+u+2 are preselected (through the parameter TC) then the parameter NDC might be used to decide between the two. A low value of NDC might restrict the selection to the smaller cluster Cu+V. ï  Consider the set of documents in each document cluster preselected above (through the parameters TC and NDC). Only the lower frequency documents are used as sources of terms for the thesaurus classes. The parameter MIDF defines the minimum value of inverse document frequency for any term which is selected to participate in a thesaurus class.   By doing so, it is possible to ensure that only low frequency terms participate in the thesaurus classes generated (terms too generic are not good synonyms). Given that the thesaurus classes have been built, they can be used for query expansion. For this, an average term weight wtc for each thesaurus class C is computed as follows. where \C\ is the number of terms in the thesaurus class C and wt,c is a Pre~ computed weight associated with the term-class pair [kt, C]. This average term weight can then be used to compute a thesaurus class weight we as The above weight formulations have been verified through experimentation and have yielded good results. Experiments with four test collections (ADI, Medlars, CACM, and LSI; see Chapter 8 for details on these collections) indicate that global analysis using a thesaurus built by the complete link algorithm might yield consistent improvements in retrieval performance. The main problem with this approach is the initialization of the parameters TC, NDC, and MIDF. The threshold value TC depends on the collection and can be difficult to set properly. Inspection of the cluster hierarchy is almost always necessary for assisting with the setting of TC. Care must be exercised because a TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        137 high value of TC might yield classes with too few terms while a low value of TC might yield too few classes. The selection of the parameter NDC can be decided more easily once TC has been set. However, the setting of the parameter MIDF might be difficult and also requires careful consideration.
mir-0095	5.5    Trends and Research Issues The relevance feedback strategies discussed here can be directly applied to the graphical interfaces of modern information systems. However, since interactivity is now of greater importance, new techniques for capturing feedback information from the user are desirable. For instance, there is great interest in graphical interfaces which display the documents in the answer set as points in a 2D or 3D space. The motivation is to allow the user to quickly identify (by visual inspection) relationships among the documents in the answer. In this scenario, a rather distinct strategy for quantifying feedback information might be required. Thus, relevance strategies for dealing with visual displays are an important research problem. In the past, global analysis was viewed as an approach which did not yield good improvements in retrieval performance. However, new results obtained at the beginning of the 1990s changed this perception. Further, the Web has provided evidence that techniques based on global analysis might be of interest to the users. For instance, this is the case with the highly popular 'Yahoo!' software which uses a manually built hierarchy of concepts to assist the user with forming the query. This suggests that investigating the utilization of global analysis techniques in the Web is a promising research problem. Local analysis techniques are interesting because they take advantage of the local context provided with the query. In this regard, they seem more appropriate than global analysis techniques. Furthermore, many positive results have been reported in the literature. The application of local analysis techniques to the Web, however, has not been explored and is a promising research direction. The main challenge is the computational burden imposed on the search engine site due to the need to process document texts at query time. Thus, a related research problem of relevance is the development of techniques for speeding up query processing at the search engine site. In truth, this problem is of interest even if one considers only the normal processing of the queries because the search engines depend on processing as many queries as possible for economic survival. The combination of local analysis, global analysis, visual displays, and interactive interfaces is also a current and important research problem. Allowing the user to visually explore the document space and providing him with clues which assist with the query formulation process are highly relevant issues. Positive results in this area might become a turning point regarding the design of user interfaces and are likely to attract wide attention. 138        QUERY OPERATIONS
mir-0096	5.6    Bibliographic Discussion Query expansion methods have been studied for a long time. While the success of expansion methods throughout the years has been debatable, more recently researchers have reached the consensus that query expansion is a useful and little explored (commercially) technique. Useful because its modern variants can be used to consistently improve the retrieval performance with general collections. Little explored because few commercial systems (and Web search engines) take advantage of it. Early work suggesting the expansion of a user query with closely related terms was done by Maron and Kuhns in 1960 [547]. The classic technique for combining query expansion with term reweighting in the vector model was studied by Rocchio in 1965 (using the Smart system [695] as a testbed) and published later on [678], Ide continued the studies of Rocchio and proposed variations to the term reweighting formula [391]. The probabilistic model was introduced by Robertson and Sparck Jones [677] in 1976. A thorough and entertaining discussion of this model can be found in the book by van Rijsbergen [785]. Croft and Harper [199] suggested that the initial search should use a distinct computation. In 1983, Croft [198] proposed to extend the probabilistic formula to include within-document frequencies and introduced the C and K parameters. Since the probabilistic model does not provide means of expanding the query, query expansion has to be done separately. In 1978, Harper and van Rijsbergen [345] used a term-term clustering technique based on a maximum spanning tree to select terms for probabilistic query expansion. Two years later, they also introduced a new relevance weighting scheme, called EMIM [344], to be used with their query expansion technique. In 1981, Wu and Salton [835] used relevance feedback to reweight terms (using a probabilistic formula) extracted from relevant documents and used these terms to expand the query. Empirical results showed improvements in retrieval performance. Our discussion on user relevance feedback for the vector and probabilistic models in section 5.2 is based on four sources: a nice paper by Salton and Buckley [696], the book by van Rijsbergen [785], the book by Salton and McGill [698], and two book chapters by Harman [340, 339]. Regarding automatic query expansion, Lesk [500] tried variations of term-term clustering in the Smart system without positive results. Following that, Sparck Jones and Barber [413] and Minker, Wilson and Zimmerman [562] also observed no improvements with query expansion based on term-term global clustering. These early research results left the impression that query expansion based on global analysis is not an effective technique. However, more recent results show that this is not the case. In fact, the research results obtained by Vorhees [793], by Crouch and Yang [200], and by Qiu and Prei [655] indicate that query expansion based on global analysis can consistently yield improved retrieval performance. Our discussion on query expansion through local clustering is based on early work by Attar and Fraenkel [35] from 1977.   The idea of local context BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        139 analysis is much more recent and was introduced by Xu and Croft [838] in 1996. The discussion on query expansion using a global similarity thesaurus is based on the work by Qiu and Prei [655]. Finally, the discussion on query expansion using a global statistical thesaurus is based on the work of Crouch and Yang [200] which is influenced by the term discrimination value theory introduced by Salton, Yang, and Yu [699] early in 1975. Since query expansion frequently is based on some form of clustering, our discussion covered a few clustering algorithms. However, our aim was not to provide a thorough review of clustering algorithms for information retrieval. Such a review can be found in the work of Rasmussen [668].
mir-0098	6.1    Introduction Text is the main form of communicating knowledge. Starting with hieroglyphs, the first written surfaces (stone, wood, animal skin, papyrus, and rice paper), and paper, text has been created everywhere, in many forms and languages. We use the term document to denote a single unit of information, typically text in a digital form, but it can also include other media. In practice, a document is loosely denned. It can be a complete logical unit, like a research article, a book or a manual. It can also be part of a larger text, such as a paragraph or a sequence of paragraphs (also called a passage of text), an entry in a dictionary, a judge's opinion on a case, the description of an automobile part, etc. Furthermore, with respect to its physical representation, a document can be any physical unit, for example a file, an email, or a World Wide Web (or just Web) page. A document has a given syntax and structure which is usually dictated by the application or by the person who created it. It also has a semantics, specified by the author of the document (who is not necessarily the same as the creator). Additionally, a document may have a presentation style associated with it, which specifies how it should be displayed or printed. Such a style is usually given by the document syntax and structure and is related to a specific application (for example, a Web browser). Figure 6.1 depicts all these relations. A document can also have information about itself, called metadata. The next section explains different types of metadata and their relevance. The syntax of a document can express structure, presentation style, semantics, or even external actions. In many cases one or more of these elements are implicit or are given together. For example, a structural element (e.g., a section) can have a fixed formatting style. The semantics of a document is also associated with its use. For example, Postscript directives are designed for drawing. The syntax of a document can be implicit in its content, or expressed in a simple declarative language or even in a programming language. For example, many editor formats are declarative while a TeX document uses a powerful typesetting language. Although a powerful language could be easier to parse than the data itself, it might be difficult to convert documents in that language to other formats.  Many syntax languages are proprietary and specific, but open 141 142        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES Document Syntax Text + Structure + Other Media Presentation Style Semantics Figure 6.1    Characteristics of a document. and generic languages are better because documents can be interchanged between applications and are more flexible. Text can also be written in natural language. However, at present the semantics of natural language is still not easy for a computer to understand. The current trend is to use languages which provide information on the document structure, format, and semantics while being readable by humans as well as computers. The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which is covered later on in this chapter, tries to balance all the issues above. Metadata, markup, and semantic encoding represent different levels of formalization of the document contents. Most documents have a particular formatting style. However, new applications are pushing for external formatting such that information can be represented independently of style, and vice versa. The presentation style can be embedded in the document, as in TeX or Rich Text Format (RTF). Style can be complemented by macros (for example, LaTeX in the case of TeX). In most cases, style is defined by the document author. However, the reader may decide part of the style (for example, by setting options in a Web browser). The style of a document defines how the document is visualized in a computer window or a printed page, but can also include treatment of other media such as audio or video. In this chapter we first cover metadata. Following that we discuss text characteristics such as formats and natural language statistics. Next we cover languages to describe text structure, presentation style, or semantics. The last part is devoted to multimedia formats and languages.
mir-0099	6.2    Metadata Most documents and text collections have associated with them what is known as metadata. Metadata is information on the organization of the data, the various data domains, and the relationship between them. In short, metadata is 'data about the data."  For instance, in a database management system, the schema METADATA        143 specifies some of the metadata, namely, the name of the relations, the fields or attributes of each relation, the domain of each attribute, etc. Common forms of metadata associated with text include the author, the date of publication, the source of the publication, the document length (in pages, words, bytes, etc.), and the document genre (book, article, memo, etc.). For example, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [807] proposes 15 fields to describe a document. Following Marchionini [542], we refer to this kind of information as Descriptive Metadata, metadata that is external to the meaning of the document, and pertains more to how it was created. Another type of metadata characterizes the subject matter that can be found within the document's contents. We will refer to this as Semantic Metadata. Semantic Metadata is associated with a wide number of documents and its availability is increasing. All books published within the USA are assigned Library of Congress subject codes, and many journals require author-assigned key terms that are selected from a closed vocabulary of relevant terms. For example, biomedical articles that appear within the MEdigital libraryINE (see Chapter 3) system are assigned topical metadata pertaining to disease, anatomy, Pharmaceuticals, and so on. To standardize semantic terms, many areas use specific ontologies, which are hierarchical taxonomies of terms describing certain knowledge topics. An important metadata format is the Machine Readable Cataloging Record (MARC) which is the most used format for library records. MARC has several fields for the different attributes of a bibliographic entry such as title, author, etc. Specific uses of MARC are given in Chapter 14. In the USA, a particular version of MARC is used: USMARC, which is an implementation of ANSI/NISO Z39.2, the American National Standard for Bibliographic Information Interchange. The USMARC format documents contain the definitions and content for the fields that have to be used in records structured according to Z39.2. This standard is maintained by the Library of Congress of the USA. With the increase of data in the Web, there are many initiatives to add metadata information to Web documents. In the Web, metadata can be used for many purposes. Some of them are cataloging (BibTeX is a popular format for this case), content rating (for example, to protect children from reading some type of documents), intellectual property rights, digital signatures (for authentication), privacy levels (who should and who should not have access to a document), applications to electronic commerce, etc. The new standard for Web metadata is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which provides interoperability between applications. This framework allows the description of Wreb resources to facilitate automated processing of the information. It does not assume any particular application or semantic domain. It consists of a description of nodes and attached attribute/value pairs. Nodes can be any WTeb resource, that is, any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which includes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Attributes are properties of nodes, and their values are text strings or other nodes (Web resources or metadata instances). To describe the semantics, values from, for example, the Dublin Core library metadata URL can be used. Other predefined vocabularies for authoring metadata are expected, in particular for content rating and for digital signatures.   In addition, currently. 144        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES there are many Web projects on ontologies for different application domains (see also Chapters 13 and 15). Metadata is also useful for metadescriptions of nontextual objects. For example, a set of keywords that describe an image. These keywords can later be used to search for the image using classic text information retrieval techniques (on the metadescriptions).
mir-0100	6.3    Text With the advent of the computer, it was necessary to code text in binary digits. The first coding schemes were EBCDIC and ASCII, which used seven bits to code each possible symbol. Later, ASCII was standardized to eight bits (ISO-Latin), to accommodate several languages, including accents and other diacritical marks. Nevertheless, ASCII is not suitable for oriental languages such as Chinese or Japanese Kanji, where each symbol might represent a concept and therefore thousands of them exist. For this case, a 16-bit code exists called Unicode (ISO 10616) [783]. In this section we cover different characteristics of text. First, the possible formats of text, ASCII being the simplest format. Second, how the information content of text can be measured, followed by different models for it. Finally, we mention briefly how we can measure similarity between strings or pieces of text.
mir-0101	6.3.1    Formats There is no single format for a text document, and an IR system should be able to retrieve information from many of them. In the past, IR systems would convert a document to an internal format. However, that has many disadvantages, because the original application related to the document is not useful any more. On top of that, we cannot change the contents of a document. Current IR systems have filters that can handle most popular documents, in particular those of word processors with some binary syntax such as Word, WordPerfect or FrameMaker. Even then, good filters might not be possible if the format is proprietary and its details are not public. This is not the case for full ASCII syntax, as in TeX documents. Although documents can be in a binary format (for example, parts of a Word document), documents that are represented in human-readable ASCII form imply more portability and are easier to modify (for example, they can be edited with different applications). Other text formats were developed for document interchange. Among these we should mention the Rich Text Format (RTF), which is used by word processors and has ASCII syntax. Other important formats were developed for displaying or printing documents. The most popular ones are the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Postscript (which is a powerful programming language for drawing). Other interchange formats are used to encode electronic mail, for example MIME (Multipurpose internet Mail Exchange). MIME supports multiple character sets, multiple languages, and multiple media. On top of these formats, nowadays many files are compressed. Text compression is treated in detail in Chapter 7, but here we comment on the most TEXT        145 popular compression software and associated formats. These include Compress (Unix), ARJ (PCs), and ZIP (for example gzip in Unix and Winzip in Windows). Other tools allow us to convert binary files, in particular compressed text, to ASCII text such that it can be transmitted through a communication line using only seven bits. Examples of these tools are uuencode/uudecode and binhex.
mir-0102	6.3.2    Information Theory Written text has a certain semantics and is a way to communicate information. Although it is difficult to formally capture how much information is there in a given text, the distribution of symbols is related to it. For example, a text where one symbol appears almost all the time does not convey much information. Information theory defines a special concept, entropy, to capture information content (or equivalently, information uncertainty). If the alphabet has a symbols, each one appearing with probability pz (probability here is defined as the symbol frequency over the total number of symbols) in a text, the entropy of this text is defined as E= -' 2=1 In this formula the a symbols of the alphabet are coded in binary, so the entropy is measured in bits. As an example, for a = 2, the entropy is 1 if both symbols appear the same number of times or 0 if only one symbol appears. We say that the amount of information in a text can be quantified by its entropy. The definition of entropy depends on the probabilities (frequencies) of each symbol. To obtain those probabilities we need a text model. So we say that the amount of information in a text is measured with regard to the text model. This concept is also important, for example, in text compression, where the entropy is a limit on how much the text can be compressed, depending on the text model. In our case we are interested in natural language, as we now discuss.
mir-0103	6.3.3    Modeling Natural Language Text is composed of symbols from a finite alphabet. We can divide the symbols in two disjoint subsets: symbols that separate words and symbols that belong to words. It is well known that symbols are not uniformly distributed. If we consider just letters (a to z), we observe that vowels are usually more frequent than most consonants. For example, in English, the letter V has the highest frequency. A simple model to generate text is the binomial model In it, each symbol is generated with a certain probability. However, natural language has a dependency on previous symbols. For example, in English, a letter ki' cannot appear after a letter V and vowels or certain consonants have a higher probability 146        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES of occurring. Therefore, the probability of a symbol depends on previous symbols. We can use a finite-context or Markovian model to reflect this dependency. The model can consider one, two, or more letters to generate the next symbol. If we use k letters, we say that it is a fc-order model (so the binomial model is considered a 0-order model). We can use these models taking words as symbols. For example, text generated by a 5-order model using the distribution of words in the Bible might make sense (that is, it can be grammatically correct), but will be different from the original. More complex models include finite-state models (which define regular languages), and grammar models (which define context free and other languages). However, finding the right grammar for natural language is still a difficult open problem. The next issue is how the different words are distributed inside each document. An approximate model is Zipf's Law [847, 310], which attempts to capture the distribution of the frequencies (that is, number of occurrences) of the words in the text. The rule states that the frequency of the i-ih most frequent word is l/ie times that of the most frequent word. This implies that in a text of n words with a vocabulary of V words, the z-th most frequent word appears n/{ie Hy{9)) times, where Hy{9) is the harmonic number of order 9 of V, defined as so that the sum of all frequencies is n. The left side of Figure 6.2 illustrates the distribution of frequencies considering that the words are arranged in decreasing order of their frequencies. The value of 6 depends on the text. In the most simple formulation, 0 = 1, and therefore Hy{9) = O(logn). However, this simplified version is very inexact, and the case 9 gt; 1 (more precisely, between 1.5 and 2.0) fits better the real data [26]. This case is very different, since the distribution is much more skewed, and Hy{6) = 0(1). Experimental data suggests that a better model is fc/(c-h£)* where c is an additional parameter and k is such that all frequencies add to n. This is called a Mandelbrot distribution [561]. Since the distribution of words is very skewed (that is, there are a few hundred words which take up 50% of the text), words that are too frequent, such as stopwords, can be disregarded. A stopword is a word which does not carry meaning in natural language and therefore can be ignored (that is, made not searchable), such as 4a,' 'the,' 'by,' etc. Fortunately the most frequent words are stopwords and therefore, half of the words appearing in a text do not need to be considered. This allows us, for instance, to significantly reduce the space overhead of indices for natural language texts. For example, the most frequent words in the TREC-2 collection (see Chapter 3 for details on this reference collection and others) are "the,1 fcof,' 'and,1 "a,1 "to1 and in1 (see also Chapter 7). Another issue is the distribution of words in the documents of a collection. A simple model is to consider that each word appears the same number of times in every document.   However, this is not true in practice.   A better model is TEXT 147 Words Text size Figure 6.2    Distribution of sorted word frequencies (left) and size of the vocabulary (right). to consider a negative binomial distribution, which says that the fraction of documents containing a word k times is a + k-l k -a-k where p and a are parameters that depend on the word and the document collection. For example, for the Brown Corpus [276] and the word *said\ we have p = 9.24 and a = 0.42 [171]. The latter reference gives other models derived from a Poisson distribution. The next issue is the number of distinct words in a document. This set of words is referred to as the document vocabulary. To predict the growth of the vocabulary size in natural language text, we use the so-called Heaps' Law [352]. This is a very precise law which states that the vocabulary of a text of size n words is of size V = KnÆ = 0{nP), where K and /3 depend on the particular text. The right side of Figure 6.2 illustrates how the vocabulary size varies with the text size. K is normally between 10 and 100, and f3 is a positive value less than one. Some experiments [26, 42] on the TREC-2 collection show that the most common values for /3 are between 0.4 and 0.6. Hence, the vocabulary of a text grows sublinearly with the text size, in a proportion close to its square root. Notice that the set of different words of a language is fixed by a constant (for example, the number of different English words is finite). However, the limit is so high that it is much more accurate to assume that the size of the vocabulary is O(n) instead of O(l), although the number should stabilize for huge enough texts. On the other hand, many authors argue that the number keeps growing anyway because of typing or spelling errors. Heaps' law also applies to collections of documents because, as the total text size grows, the predictions of the model become more accurate. Furthermore, this model is also valid for the World Wide Web (see Chapter 13). The last issue is the average length of words. This relates the text size in 148        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES words with the text size in bytes (without accounting for punctuation and other extra symbols). For example, in the different subcollections of the TREC-2 collection, the average word length is very close to 5 letters, and the range of variation of this average in each subcollection is small (from 4.8 to 5.3 letters). If we remove the stopwords, the average length of a word increases to a number between 6 and 7 (letters). If we take only the words of the vocabulary, the average length is higher (about 8 or 9). This defines the total space needed for the vocabulary. Heaps' law implies that the length of the words in the vocabulary increases logarithmically with the text size and thus, that longer and longer words should appear as the text grows. However, in practice, the average length of the words in the overall text is constant because shorter words are common enough (e.g. stop-words). This balance between short and long words, such that the average word length remains constant, has been noticed many times in different contexts, and can also be explained by a finite-state model in which: (a) the space character has probability close to 0.2; (b) the space character cannot appear twice subsequently; and (c) there are 26 letters [561]. This simple model is consistent with Zipf's and Heaps' laws. The models presented in this section are used in Chapters 8 and 13, in particular Zipf's and Heaps' laws.
mir-0104	6.3.4    Similarity Models In this section we define notions of syntactic similarity between strings or documents. Similarity is measured by a distance function. For example, if we have strings of the same length, we can define the distance between them as the number of positions that have different characters. Then, the distance is 0 if they are equal. This is called the Hamming distance. A distance function should also be symmetric (that is, the order of the arguments does not matter) and should satisfy the triangle inequality (that is, distance(a, c) lt; distance(a, b) 4- distance(b, c)). An important distance over strings is the edit or Levenshtein distance mentioned earlier. The edit distance is defined as the minimum number of characters, insertions, deletions, and substitutions that we need to perform in any of the strings to make them equal. For instance, the edit distance between 'color1 and 'colour1 is one, while the edit distance between 'survey1 arid 'surgery' is two. The edit distance is considered to be superior for modeling syntactic errors than other more complex methods such as the Soundex system, which is based on phonetics [595]. Extensions to the concept of edit distance include different weights for each operation, adding transpositions, etc. There are other measures. For example, assume that we are comparing two given strings and the only operation allowed is deletion of characters. Then, after all non-common characters have been deleted, the remaining sequence of characters (not necessarily contiguous in the original string, but in the same order) is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of both strings. For example, the LCS of 'survey' and "surgery' is %surey.' MARKUP LANGUAGES        149 Similarity can be extended to documents. For example, we can consider lines as single symbols and compute the longest common sequence of lines between two files. This is the measure used by the dif f command in Unix-like operating systems. The main problem with this approach is that it is very time consuming and does not consider lines that are similar. The latter drawback can be fixed by taking a weighted edit distance between lines or by computing the LCS over all the characters. Other solutions include extracting fingerprints (any piece of text that in some sense characterizes it) for the documents and comparing them, or finding large repeated pieces. There are also visual tools to see document similarity. For example, Dotplot draws a rectangular map where both coordinates are file lines and the entry for each coordinate is a gray pixel that depends on the edit distance between the associated lines.
mir-0105	6.4    Markup Languages Markup is defined as extra textual syntax that can be used to describe formatting actions, structure information, text semantics, attributes, etc. For example, the formatting commands of TeX (a popular text formatting software) could be considered markup. However, formal markup languages are much more structured. The marks are called tags, and usually, to avoid ambiguity, there is an initial and ending tag surrounding the marked text. The standard metalanguage for markup is SGML, as already mentioned. An important subset of SGML is XML (extensible Markup Language), the new metalanguage for the Web. The most popular markup language used for the Web, HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is an instance of SGML. All these languages and examples of them are described below.
mir-0106	6.4.1    SGML SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language (ISO 8879) and is a metalanguage for tagging text developed by a group led by Goldfarb [303] based on earlier work done at IBM. That is, SGML provides the rules for defining a markup language based on tags. Each instance of SGML includes a description of the document structure called a document type definition. Hence, an SGML document is defined by: (1) a description of the structure of the document and (2) the text itself marked with tags which describe the structure. We will explain later the syntax associated with the tags. The document type definition is used to describe and name the pieces that a document is composed of and define how those pieces relate to each other. Part of the definition can be specified by an SGML document type declaration (DTD). 150        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES Other parts, such as the semantics of elements and attributes, or application conventions, cannot be expressed formally in SGML. Comments can be used, however, to express them informally. This means that all of the rules for applying SGML markup to documents are part of the definition, and those that can be expressed in SGML syntax are represented in the DTD. The DTD does not define the semantics (that is, the meaning, presentation, and behavior), or intended use, of the tags. However, some semantic information can be included in comments embedded in the DTD, while more complete information is usually present in separate documentation. This additional documentation typically describes the elements, or logical pieces of data, the attributes, and information about those pieces of data. For example, two tags can have the same name but different semantics in two different applications. Tags are denoted by angle brackets (lt;tagnamegt;). Tags are used to identify the beginning and ending of pieces of the document, for example a quote in a literary text. Ending tags are specified by adding a slash before the tag name (e.g., lt;/tagnamegt;). For example, the tag lt;/authoxgt; could be used to identify the element 'name of author,' which appears in italics and generates a link to a biographic sketch. Tag attributes are specified at the beginning of the element, inside the angle brackets and after the nametag using the syntax attname=value. Figure 6.3 gives an example of a simple DTD and a document using it. While we do not intend to discuss SGML syntax here, we give a brief description of the example such that the reader can grasp the main ideas. Each ELEMENT represents a tag denoted by its name. The two following characters indicate if the starting and ending tags are compulsory (-) or optional (0). For example, the ending tag for prolog is necessary while for sender it is not. Following that, the inside portion of the content tag is specified using a regular expression style syntax where V stands for concatenation, 4|' stands for logical or, '?' stands for zero or one occurrence, '*' stands for zero or more occurrences, and k+' stands for one or more occurrences of the preceding element. The content tag can be composed of the combination of other tag contents, ASCII characters (PCDATA), and binary data (NDATA), or EMPTY. The possible attributes of a tag are given in an attribute list (ATTLIST) identified by the tag name, followed by the name of each attribute, its type, and if it is required or not (otherwise, the default value is given). An SGML document instance is associated with the DTD so that the various tools working with the data know which are the correct tags and how they are organized. The document description generally does not specify how a document should look, for example when it is printed on paper or displayed on a screen. Because SGML separates content from format, we can create very good models of data that have no mechanism for describing the format, hence, no standard way to output the data in a formatted fashion. Therefore, output specifications, which are directions on how to format a document, are often added to SGML documents. For this purpose, output specification standards such as DSSSL (Document Style Semantic Specification Language) and FOSI (Formatted Output Specification Instance) were devised. Both of these standards define mechanisms for associating style information with SGML document instances.

They are the components of an SGML system used for defining, for instance, that the data identified by a tag should be typeset in italics. One important use of SGML is in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The TEI is a cooperative project that started in 1987 and includes several US associations related to the humanities and linguistics. The main goal is to generate guidelines for the preparation and interchange of electronic texts for scholarly 152        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES research, as well as for industry. In addition to the guidelines, TEI provides several document formats through SGML DTDs. One of the most used formats is TEI Lite. The TEI Lite DTD can be used stand-alone or together with the full set of TEI DTD files.
mir-0107	6.4.2    HTML HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is an instance of SGML. HTML was created in 1992 and has evolved during the past years, 4.0 being the latest version, released as a recommendation at the end of 1997. Currently it is being extended in many ways to solve its many limitations, for example, to be able to write mathematical formulas. Most documents on the Web are stored and transmitted in HTML. HTML is a simple language well suited for hypertext, multimedia, and the display of small and simple documents. HTML is based on SGML, and although there is an HTML DTD (Document Type Definition), most HTML instances do not explicitly make reference to the DTD. The HTML tags follow all the SGML conventions and also include formatting directives. HTML documents can have other media embedded within them, such as images or audio in different formats. HTML also has fields for metadata, which can be used for different applications and purposes. If we also add programs (for example, using Javascript) inside a page, some people call it dynamic HTML (or DHTML). This should not be confused with a Microsoft proposal (also called dynamic HTML) of an Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. Figure 6.4 gives an example of an HTML document together with its output in a Web browser. Because HTML does not fix the presentation style of a document, in 1997, Cascade Style Sheets (CSS) were introduced. CSS offer a powerful and manageable way for authors, artists, and typographers to create visual effects that improve the aesthetics of HTML pages in the Web. Style sheets can be used one after another (called cascading) to define the presentation style for different elements of an HTML page. Style sheets separate information about presentation from document content, which in turn simplifies Web site maintenance, promotes Web page accessibility, and makes the Web faster. However, CSS support In current browsers is still modest. Another disadvantage is that two style sheets do not have to be consistent nor complete, so the stylistic result might not be good, in particular regarding color. CSS are supposed to balance the expectations of the author and of the reader regarding presentation Issues. Nevertheless, it is not clear who or in which cases the author or the reader should define the presentation. The evolution of HTML implies support for backward compatibility and also for forward compatibility, because people should also be able to see new documents with old browsers. HTML 4.0 has been specified in three flavors: strict, transitional, and frameset. Strict HTML only worries about non-presentational MARKUP LANGUAGES   153 lt;htmlgt; lt;headgt; lt;titlegt;HTML Examplelt;/titlegt; lt;meta naine=rby content="Just an example"gt; lt;/headgt; lt;bodygt; lt;hlgt;HTML Examplelt;/hlgt; lt;pgt; lt;hrgt; lt;pgt; HTML has many lt;igt;tagslt;/igt;, among them: lt;ligt; links to other lt;a href=http://www.w3c.org/gt;pageslt;/agt; (a from anchor), lt;ligt; paragraphs (p) , headings (hi, h2, etc), font types (b, i), lt;ligt; horizontal rules (hr), indented lists and items (ul, li), lt;ligt; images (img), tables, forms, etc. lt;hrgt; lt;Pgt; lt;img align=left src="at_work.gif"gt; This page is lt;bgt;alwayslt;/bgt; under construction. lt;/bodygt; lt;/htmlgt; HTML Example HTML has many tags, among them: ¶ links to other gag^.

Transitional HTML uses all the presentational features for pages that should be read for old browsers that do not understand CSS. Frameset HTML is used when you want to partition the browser window in two or more frames. HTML 4.0 includes support for style sheets, internationalization, frames, richer tables and forms, and accessibility options for people with disabilities. Typical HTML applications use a fixed small set of tags in conformance with a single SGML specification. Fixing a small set of tags allows users to leave the language specification out of the document and makes it much easier to build applications, but this advantage comes at the cost of severely limiting HTML in several important aspects. In particular, HTML does not: ï  allow users to specify their own tags or attributes in order to parameterize or otherwise semantically qualify their data; ï  support the specification of nested structures needed to represent database schemas or object-oriented hierarchies; ï  support the kind of language specification that allows consuming applications to check data for structural validity on importation. In contrast to HTML stands generic SGML. A generic SGML application is one that supports SGML language specifications of arbitrary complexity and makes possible the qualities of extensibility, structure, and validation missing in HTML. SGML makes it possible to define your own formats for your own documents, to handle large and complex documents, and to manage large information repositories. However, full SGML contains many optional features that are not needed for Web applications and have proven to have a cost/benefit ratio unattractive to current vendors of Web browsers. All these reasons led to the development of XML, a simpler metalanguage that is described in the next section.
mir-0108	6.4.3    XML XML stands for extensible Markup Language and is a simplified subset of SGML. That is, XML is not a markup language, as HTML is, but a metalanguage that is capable of containing markup languages in the same way as SGML. XML allows a human-readable semantic markup, which is also machine-readable. As a result, XML makes it easier to develop and deploy new specific markup, enabling automatic authoring, parsing, and processing of networked data. In some ways, XML alkws one to do many things that today are done by Java scripts or other program interfaces. XML does not have many of the restrictions imposed by HTML but on the other hand imposes a more rigid syntax on the markup, which becomes important at processing time. In XML, ending tags cannot be omitted. Also, tags for elements that do not have any content, like BR and IMG, are specially marked by a slash before the closing angle bracket. XML also distinguishes upper MARKUP LANGUAGES         155 lt;?XML VERSION="i.O"  RMD="NOKrE"   ?gt; lt;e-mail id="94108rbyn  date^sent="02101998"gt; lt;prologgt; lt;sendergt; Pablo Neruda lt;/sendergt; lt;addressgt; Federico Garcia Lorca lt;/addressgt; lt;addressgt; Ernest Hemingway lt;/addressgt; lt;subjectgt; Pictures of my house in Isla Negra lt;Ccgt; Gabriel Garcia Marquez lt;/Ccgt; lt;/prologgt; lt;contentsgt; lt;pargt; As promised in my previous letter, I am sending two digital pictures to show you my house and the splendid view of the Pacific Ocean from my bedroom (photo lt;ref idref="F2"/gt;) . lt;/pargt; lt;image id="Fl" ref="photol.gif" /gt; lt;image id="F2"gt; ref="photo2.jpg" /gt; lt;pargt; Regards from the South, Pablo. lt;/pargt; lt;/contentsgt; Figure 6.5    An XML document without a DTD analogous to the previous SGML example. and lower case, so img and IMG are different tags (this is not true in HTML). In addition, all attribute values must be between quotes. This implies that parsing XML without knowledge of the tags is easier. In particular, using a DTD is optional. If there is no DTD, the tags are obtained while the parsing is done. With respect to SGML, there are a few syntactic differences, and many more restrictions. Listing all these differences is beyond the scope of this book, but Figure 6.5 shows an example of a DTDless XML document based on the previous electronic mail DTD given for SGML (see Figure 6.3). The RMD attribute stands for Required Markup Declaration, which indicates whether a DTD must be used or not (no DTD in this case). Other possible values are INTERNAL which means that the DTD is inside the document or ALL (default value) which allows the use of external sources for part or the whole DTD as in SGML. XML allows any user to define new tags, define more complex structures (for example, unbounded nesting with the same rules of SGML) and has data validation capabilities. As XML is very new, there is still some discussion of how it will change or impact Internet applications. XML is a profile of SGML that eliminates many of the difficulties of implementing things, so for the most part it behaves just like SGML, as shown before. As mentioned, XML removes the requirement for the existence of a DTD, which can be parsed directly from the data. Removing the DTD places even more importance on the application documentation. This can also have a large impact on the functions that the software 156        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES provides. For example, it means that if an XML editor does not use a DTD, how will it help the user to tag the documents consistently? These problems should be resolved in the near future. In the case of semantic ambiguity between tag names, one goal is to have a namespace such that there is a convention for its use. The Extensible Style sheet Language (XSL) is the XML counterpart of Cascading Style Sheets. XSL is designed to transform and style highly-structured, data-rich documents written in XML. For example, with XSL it would be possible to automatically extract a table of contents from a document. The syntax of XSL has been defined using XML. In addition to adding style to a document, XSL can be used to transform XML documents to HTML and CSS. This is analogous to macros in a word processor. Another extension to XML, defined using XML, is the Extensible Linking Language (XLL). XLL defines different types of links, including external and internal links. In particular, any element type can be the origin of a link and outgoing links can be defined on documents that cannot be modified. The behavior of the links is also more generic. The object linked can be embedded in, or replace the document. It is also possible to generate a new context without changing the current application (for example, the object is displayed in a new window). Recent uses of XML include: ï  Mathematical Markup Language (MathML): two sets of tags, one for presentation of formulas and another for the meaning of mathematical expressions. ï  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL): a declarative language for scheduling multimedia presentations in the Web, where the position and activation time of different objects can be specified. ï  Resource Description Format (already covered in section 6.2): metadata information for XML should be given using RDF. The XML movement is one indication that a parseable, hierarchical object model will play an increasingly major role in the evolution of HTML. The next generation of HTML should be based on a suite of XML tag sets to be used together with mathematics, synchronized multimedia, and vector graphics (possibly using the XML-based languages already mentioned). That is, the emphasis will be on structuring and modeling data rather than on presentation and layout issues.
mir-0109	6.5    Multimedia Multimedia usually stands for applications that handle different types of digital data originating from distinct types of media. The most common types of media in multimedia applications are text, sound, images, and video (which is an animated sequence of images). The digital data originating from each of these four MULTIMEDIA        157 types of media is quite distinct in volume, format, and processing requirements (for instance, video and audio impose real time constraints on their processing). As an immediate consequence, different types of formats are necessary for storing each type of media. In this section we cover formats and standard languages for multimedia applications. In contrast with text formats, most formats for multimedia are partially binary and hence can only be processed by a computer. Also, the presentation style is almost completely defined, perhaps with the exception of some spatial or temporal attributes.
mir-0110	6.5.1    Formats Multimedia includes images, audio and video, as well as other binary data. We now briefly survey the main formats used for all these data types. They are used mainly in the Web and in digital libraries (see Chapters 13 and 15). There are several formats for images. The simplest formats are direct representations of a bit-mapped (or pixel-based) display such as XBM, BMP, or PCX. However, those formats consume too much space. For example, a typical computer screen which uses 256 colors for each pixel might require more than 1 Mb (one megabyte) in storage just for describing the content of a single screen frame. In practice, images have a lot of redundancy and can be compressed efficiently. So, most popular image formats incorporate compression such as CompuServe's Graphic Interchange Format (GIF). GIF is good for black and white pictures, as well as pictures that have a small number of colors or gray levels (say 256). To improve compression ratios for higher resolutions, lossy compression was developed. That is, uncompressing a compressed image does not give the original. This is done by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format, which tries to eliminate parts of the image that have less impact on the human eye. This format is parametric, in the sense that the loss can be tuned. Another common image format is the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF). This format is used to exchange documents between different applications and different computer platforms. TIFF has fields for metadata and also supports compression as well as different numbers of colors. Yet another format is Truevision Targa image file (TGA), which is associated with video game boards. There are many more image formats, many of them associated to particular applications ranging from fax (bi-level image formats such as JBIG) to fingerprints (highly accurate and compressed formats such as WSQ) and satellite images (large resolution and full-color images). In 1996 a new bit-mapped image format was proposed for the Internet: Portable Network Graphics (PNG). This format could be important in the future. Audio must be digitalized first in order to be stored properly. The most common formats for small pieces of digital audio are AU, MIDI, and WAVE. MIDI is an standard format to interchange music between electronic instruments and computers. For audio libraries other formats are used such as RealAudio or CD formats. 158        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES There are several formats for animations or moving images (similar to video or TV), but here we mention only the most popular ones. The main one is MPEG (Moving Pictures Expert Group) which is related to JPEG. MPEG works by coding the changes with respect to a base image which is given at fixed intervals. In this way, MPEG profits from the temporal image redundancy that any video has. Higher quality is achieved by using more frames and higher resolution. MPEG specifies different compression levels, but usually not all the applications support all of them. This format also includes the audio signal associated with the video. Other video formats are AVI, FLI, and QuickTime. AVI may include compression (CinePac), as well as QuickTime, which was developed by Apple. As for MPEG, audio is also included.
mir-0111	6.5.2    Textual Images A particular class of images that is very important in office systems, multimedia retrieval and digital libraries are images of documents that contain mainly typed or typeset text. These are called textual images and are obtained by scanning the documents, usually for archiving purposes ó a procedure that also makes the images (and their associated text) available to anyone through a computer network. The fact that a large portion of a textual image is text can be used for retrieval purposes and efficient compression. Although we do not cover image compression in this chapter, we have seen that the most popular image formats include some form of compression embedded in them. In the case of textual images, further compression can be achieved by extracting the different text symbols or marks from the image, building a library of symbols for them, and representing each one (within the image) by a position in the library. As many symbols are repeated, the compression ratio is quite good. Although this technique is lossy (because the reconstructed image is not equal to the original), the reconstructed image can be read without problems. Additional information can be stored to reproduce the original image, but for most applications this is not needed. If the image contains non-textual information such as logos or signatures, which might be necessary to reproduce, they may be extracted through a segmentation process, stored, and compressed separately. When needed, the textual and non-textual parts of the image can be combined and displayed together. Regarding the retrieval of textual images, several alternatives are possible as follows: ï  At creation time or when added to the database, a set of ke}rwords that describe the image is associated with it (for example, metadata can be used). Later, conventional text retrieval techniques can be applied to those keywords. This alternative is valid for any multimedia object. ï  Use OCR to extract the text of the image. The resultant ASCII text can be used to extract keywords, as before, or as a full-text description of the MULTIMEDIA        159 image. Depending on the document type, the OCR output could be reasonably good or actually quite bad (consider the first page of a newspaper, with several columns, different font types and sizes). In any case, many typos are introduced and a usual keyword-based query might miss many documents (in this case, an approximate search is better, but also slower). Use the symbols extracted from the images as basic units to combine image retrieval techniques (see Chapter 12) with sequence retrieval techniques (see Chapter 8). In this case, the query is transformed into a symbol sequence that has to match approximately another symbol sequence in the compressed image. This idea seems promising but has not been pursued yet.
mir-0112	6.5.3    Graphics and Virtual Reality There are many formats proposed for three-dimensional graphics. Although this topic is not fully relevant to information retrieval, we include some information here for the sake of completeness. Our emphasis here is on the Web. The Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) standard (ISO 8632) is defined for the open interchange of structured graphical objects and their associated attributes. CGM specifies a two-dimensional data interchange standard which allows graphical data to be stored and exchanged between graphics devices, applications, and computer systems in a device-independent manner. It is a structured format that can represent vector graphics (for example, polylines or ellipses), raster graphics, and text. Although initially CGM was a vector graphics format, it has been extended to include raster capabilities and provides a very useful format for combined raster and vector images. A metafile is a collection of elements. These elements may be the geometric components of the picture, such as polyline or polygon; the appearance of these components; or how to interpret a particular metafile or a particular picture. The CGM standard specifies which elements are allowed to occur in which positions in a metafile. The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML, ISO/IEC 14772-1) is a file format for describing interactive 3D objects and wrorlds and is a subset of the Silicon Graphics Openlnventor file format. VRML is also intended to be a universal interchange format for integrated 3D graphics and multimedia. VRML may be used in a variety of application areas such as engineering and scientific visualization, multimedia presentations, entertainment and educational titles, Web pages, and shared virtual worlds. VRML has become the de facto standard modeling language for the Web.
mir-0113	6.5.4    HyTime The Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language {HyTime) is a standard (ISO/IEC 10744) defined for multimedia documents markup.    HyTime is an SGML architecture that specifies the generic hypermedia structure of documents. 160        TEXT AND MULTIMEDIA LANGUAGES AND PROPERTIES Following the guiding principle of SGML, HyTime-defined structure is independent of any presentation of the encoded document. As an architecture, HyTime allows DTDs to be written for individual document models that use HyTime constructs, specifying how these document sets tailor the composition of these constructs for their particular representational needs. The standard also provides several metaDTDs, facilitating the design of new multimedia markup languages. The hypermedia concepts directly represented by HyTime include ï  complex locating of document objects, ï  relationships (hyperlinks) between document objects, and ï  numeric, measured associations between document objects. The HyTime architecture has three parts: the base linking and addressing architecture, the scheduling architecture (derived from the base architecture), and the rendition architecture (which is an application of the scheduling architecture). The base architecture addresses the syntax and semantics of hyperlinks. For most simple hypermedia presentations, this should be enough. The scheduling module of HyTime defines the abstract representation of arbitrarily complex hypermedia structures, including music and interactive presentations. Its basic mechanism is a simple one: the sequencing of object containers along axes measured in temporal or spatial units. The rendition module is essentially an application of the scheduling architecture that defines a general mechanism for defining the creation of new schedules from existing schedules by applying special "rendition rules' of different types. HyTime does not directly specify graphical interfaces, user navigation, user interaction, or the placement of media on time lines and screen displays. These aspects of document processing are rendered from the HyTime constructs in a manner specified by mechanisms such as style sheets, as is done with SGML documents. One application of HyTime, is the Standard Music Description Language (SMdigital library). SDML is an architecture for the representation of music information, either alone, or in conjunction with other media, also supporting multimedia time sequencing information. Another application is the Metafile for Interactive Documents (MID). MID is a common interchange structure, based on SGML and HyTime. that takes data from various authoring systems and structures it for display on dissimilar presentation systems, with minimal human intervention.
mir-0114	6.6    Trends and Research issues Many changes and proposals are happening, and very rapidly, in particular due to the advent of the Web. At this point, the reader must be lost in a salad of acronyms (we were ton!), in spite of the fact that we have only mentioned the most important languages and formats. The most important of these are included in the Glossary at the end of this book. Soine people believe that new Languages TEI Lite TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        161 SGML                                            :         DSSSL 1 XSL A CSS Style sheets Next           RDF      MathML    SMIL Generation HTML Figure 6.6    Taxonomy of Web languages. format specifications such as CSS or XML take away the simplicity of HTML, which is the basis of its success. Only the future will tell. Figure 6.6 illustrates a taxonomy of the main languages considered. Solid lines indicate instances of a metalanguage (for example, HTML is an instance of SGML), while dashed lines indicate derived languages. The main trend is the convergence and integration of the different efforts, the Web being the main application. A European alternative to SGML is the Open Document Architecture (ODA) which is also a standard (ISO 8613 [398]). ODA was designed to share documents electronically without losing control over the content, structure, and layout of those documents. ODA defines a logical structure (like SGML), a layout and the content (including vector and raster graphics). An ODA file can also be formatted, processable, or formatted processable. Formatted files cannot be edited and have information about content and layout. The other two types can be edited. Processable files also have logical information in addition to content, while formatted processable files have everything. ODA is not used very much nowadays (see also Chapter 11). Recent developments include: ï  An object model is being defined:   the document object model (DOM).

Among them we can mention SDML (Signed Document Markup Language), VML (Vector Markup Language), and PGML (Precision Graphics Markup Language).   The latter is based on the 2D imaging model of Postscript and PDF.
mir-0115	6.7    Bibliographic Discussion The document model used in the introduction is based on [437]. Specific information on Web metadata is given in [487, 753]. Most of the information about markup languages and related issues is from the World Wide Web Consortium (see www.w3. org), in particular information on new developments such as DOM or SMIL. More information on SGML and XML is given by Goldfarb [303, 304]. Additional references in SGML are [369, 756] (in particular, the SGML example has been adapted from [24]). There are hundreds of books on HTML. Two sources for HTML 4.0 are [207, 796], A book on CSS is [517]. For information on XML, XSL, and XLL see [795, 799, 798]. For a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of XML and related languages see [182, 106, 455, 436]. More information on multimedia formats can be found in [501]. Formats for images and compression of textual images are covered in detail in [825].
mir-0117	7.1     Introduction As discussed in Chapter 2, not all words are equally significant for representing the semantics of a document. In written language, some words carry more meaning than others. Usually, noun words (or groups of noun words) are the ones which are most representative of a document content. Therefore, it is usually considered worthwhile to preprocess the text of the documents in the collection to determine the terms to be used as index terms. During this preprocessing phase other useful text operations can be performed such as elimination of stop-words, stemming (reduction of a word to its grammatical root), the building of a thesaurus, and compression. Such text operations are discussed in this chapter. We already know that representing documents by sets of index terms leads to a rather imprecise representation of the semantics of the documents in the collection. For instance, a term like 'the" has no meaning whatsoever by itself and might lead to the retrieval of various documents which are unrelated to the present user query. We say that using the set of all words in a collection to index its documents generates too much noise for the retrieval task. One way to reduce this noise is to reduce the set of words which can be used to refer to (i.e., to index) documents. Thus, the preprocessing of the documents in the collection might be viewed simply as a process of controlling the size of the vocabulary (i.e., the number of distinct words used as an index terms). It is expected that the use of a controlled vocabulary leads to an improvement in retrieval performance. While controlling the size of the vocabulary is a common technique with commercial systems, it does introduce an additional step in the indexing process which is frequently not easily perceived by the users. As a result, a common user might be surprised with some of the documents retrieved and with the absence of other documents which he expected to see. For instance, he might remember that a certain document contains the string 'the house of the lord and notice that such a document is not present among the top 20 documents retrieved in 163 164        TEXT OPERATIONS response to his query request (because the controlled vocabulary contains neither 'the' nor 'of'). Thus, it should be clear that, despite a potential improvement in retrieval performance, text transformations done at preprocessing time might make it more difficult for the user to interpret the retrieval task. In recognition of this problem, some search engines in the Web are giving up text operations entirely and simply indexing all the words in the text. The idea is that, despite a more noisy index, the retrieval task is simpler (it can be interpreted as a full text search) and more intuitive to a common user. Besides document preprocessing, other types of operations on documents can also be attempted with the aim of improving retrieval performance. Among these we distinguish the construction of a thesaurus representing conceptual term relationships and the clustering of related documents. Thesauri are also covered in this chapter. The discussion on document clustering is covered in Chapter 5 because it is an operation which might depend on the current user query. Text normalization and the building of a thesaurus are strategies aimed at improving the precision of the documents retrieved. However, in the current world of very large digital libraries, improving the efficiency (in terms of time) of the retrieval process has also become quite critical. In fact, Web search engines are currently more concerned with reducing query response time than with improving precision and recall figures. The reason is that they depend on processing a high number of queries per unit of time for economic survival. To reduce query response time, one might consider the utilization of text compression as a promising alternative. A good compression algorithm is able to reduce the text to 30-35% of its original size. Thus, compressed text requires less storage space and takes less time to be transmitted over a communication link. The main disadvantage is the time spent compressing and decompressing the text. Until recently, it was generally understood that compression does not provide substantial gains in processing time because the extra time spent compressing/decompressing text would offset any gains in operating with compressed data. Further, the use of compression makes the overall design and implementation of the information system more complex. However, modern compression techniques are slowly changing this understanding towards a more favorable view of the adoption of compression techniques. By modern compression techniques we mean good compression and decompression speeds, fast random access without the need to decode the compressed text from the beginning, and direct searching on the compressed text without decompressing it, among others. Besides compression, another operation on text which is becoming more and more important is encryption. In fact, due to the fast popularization of services in the Web (including all types of electronic commerce), key (and old) questions regarding security and privacy have surfaced again. More than ever before, impersonation and unauthorized access might result in great prejudice and financial damage to people and organizations. The solution to these problems is not simple but can benefit from the operation of encrypting text. Discussing encrypted text is beyond the scope of this book but an objective and brief introduction to the topic can be found in [501]. DOCUMENT PREPROCESSING         165 In this chapter, we first discuss five preprocessing text operations including thesauri. Following that, we very briefly summarize the problem of document clustering (which is discussed in detail in Chapter 5). Finally, a thorough discussion on the issue of text compression, its modern variations, and its main implications is provided.
mir-0118	7.2    Document Preprocessing Document preprocessing is a procedure which can be divided mainly into five text operations (or transformations): (1)  Lexical analysis of the text with the objective of treating digits, hyphens, punctuation marks, and the case of letters. (2)  Elimination of stopwords with the objective of filtering out words with very low discrimination values for retrieval purposes. (3)  Stemming of the remaining words with the objective of removing affixes (i.e., prefixes and suffixes) and allowing the retrieval of documents containing syntactic variations of query terms (e.g., connect, connecting, connected, etc). (4)  Selection of index terms to determine which words/stems (or groups of words) will be used as an indexing elements.    Usually, the decision on whether a particular word will be used as an index term is related to the syntactic nature of the word.   In fact, noun words frequently carry more semantics than adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. (5)  Construction of term categorization structures such as a thesaurus, or extraction of structure directly represented in the text, for allowing the expansion of the original query with related terms (a usually useful procedure). In the following, each of these phases is discussed in detail. But, before proceeding, let us take a look at the logical view of the documents which results after each of the above phases is completed. Figure 1.2 is repeated here for convenience as Figure 7.1. As already discussed, by aggregating the preprocessing phases, we are able to move the logical view of the documents (adopted by the system) from that of a full text to that of a set of high level indexing terms.
mir-0119	7.2.1    Lexical Analysis of the Text Lexical analysis is the process of converting a stream of characters (the text of the documents) into a stream of words (the candidate words to be adopted as index terms). Thus, one of the major objectives of the lexical analysis phase is the identification of the words in the text. At first glance, all that seems to be involved is the recognition of spaces as word separators (in which case, multiple 166 TEXT OPERATIONS Figure 7.1    Logical view of a document throughout the various phases of text preprocessing. spaces are reduced to one space). However, there is more to it than this. For instance, the following four particular cases have to be considered with care [263]: digits, hyphens, punctuation marks, and the case of the letters (lower and upper case). Numbers are usually not good index terms because, without a surrounding context, they are inherently vague. For instance, consider that a user is interested in documents about the number of deaths due to car accidents between the years 1910 and 1989. Such a request could be specified as the set of index terms {deaths, car, accidents, years, 1910, 1989}. However, the presence of the numbers 1910 and 1989 in the query could lead to the retrieval, for instance, of a variety of documents which refer to either of these two years. The problem is that numbers by themselves are just too vague. Thus, in general it is wise to disregard numbers as index terms. However, we have also to consider that digits might appear mixed within a word. For instance, '510B.C/ is a clearly important index term. In this case, it is not clear what rule should be applied. Furthermore, a sequence of 16 digits identifying a credit card number might be highly relevant in a given context and, in this case, should be considered as an index term. A preliminary approach for treating digits in the text might be to remove all words containing sequences of digits unless specified otherwise (through regular expressions). Further, an advanced lexical analysis procedure might perform some date and number normalization to unify formats. Hyphens pose another difficult decision to the lexical analyzer. Breaking up hyphenated words might be useful due to inconsistency of usage. For instance, this allows treating "state-of-the-art' and 'state of the art' identically. However, there are words which include hyphens as an integral part. For instance, gilt-edge, B-49, etc. Again, the most suitable procedure seems to adopt a general role and specify the exceptions on a case by case basis. Normally, punctuation marks are removed entirely in the process of lexical analysis.  While some punctuation marks are an integral part of the word (for DOCUMENT PREPROCESSING         167 instance, '510B.C.7), removing them does not seem to have an impact in retrieval performance because the risk of misinterpretation in this case is minimal. In fact, if the user specifies '510B.C in his query, removal of the dot both in the query term and in the documents will not affect retrieval. However, very particular scenarios might again require the preparation of a list of exceptions. For instance, if a portion of a program code appears in the text, it might be wise to distinguish between the variables 'x.id' and *xid.' In this case, the dot mark should not be removed. The case of letters is usually not important for the identification of index terms. As a result, the lexical analyzer normally converts all the text to either lower or upper case. However, once more, very particular scenarios might require the distinction to be made. For instance, when looking for documents which describe details about the command language of a Unix-like operating system, the user might explicitly desire the non-conversion of upper cases because this is the convention in the operating system. Further, part of the semantics might be lost due to case conversion. For instance, the words Bank and bank have different meanings ó a fact common to many other pairs of words. As pointed out by Fox [263], all these text operations can be implemented without difficulty. However, careful thought should be given to each one of them because they might have a profound impact at document retrieval time. This is particularly worrisome in those situations in which the user finds it difficult to understand what the indexing strategy is doing. Unfortunately, there is no clear solution to this problem. As already mentioned, some Web search engines are opting for avoiding text operations altogether because this simplifies the interpretation the user has of the retrieval task. Whether this strategy will be the one of choice in the long term remains to be seen.
mir-0120	7.2.2    Elimination of Stopwords As discussed in Chapter 2, words which are too frequent among the documents in the collection are not good discriminators. In fact, a word which occurs in 80% of the documents in the collection is useless for purposes of retrieval. Such words are frequently referred to as stopwords and are normally filtered out as potential index terms. Articles, prepositions, and conjunctions are natural candidates for a list of stopwords. Elimination of stopwords has an additional important benefit. It reduces the size of the indexing structure considerably. In fact, it is typical to obtain a compression in the size of the indexing structure (for instance, in the size of an inverted list, see Chapter 8) of 40% or more solely with the elimination of stopwords. Since stopword elimination also provides for compression of the indexing structure, the list of stopwords might be extended to include words other than articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. For instance, some verbs, adverbs, and adjectives could be treated as stopwords. In [275]. a list of 425 stopwords is illustrated. Programs in C for lexical analysis are also provided. 168        TEXT OPERATIONS Despite these benefits, elimination of stopwords might reduce recall. For instance, consider a user who is looking for documents containing the phrase Ho be or not to be.: Elimination of stopwords might leave only the term be making it almost impossible to properly recognize the documents which contain the phrase specified. This is one additional reason for the adoption of a full text index (i.e., insert all words in the collection into the inverted file) by some Web search engines.
mir-0121	7.2.3    Stemming Frequently, the user specifies a word in a query but only a variant of this word is present in a relevant document. Plurals, gerund forms, and past tense suffixes are examples of syntactical variations which prevent a perfect match between a query word and a respective document word. This problem can be partially overcome with the substitution of the words by their respective stems. A stem is the portion of a word which is left after the removal of its affixes (i.e., prefixes and suffixes). A typical example of a stem is the word connect which is the stem for the variants connected, connecting, connection, and connections. Stems are thought to be useful for improving retrieval performance because they reduce variants of the same root word to a common concept. Furthermore, stemming has the secondary effect of reducing the size of the indexing structure because the number of distinct index terms is reduced. While the argument supporting stemming seems sensible, there is controversy in the literature about the benefits of stemming for retrieval performance. In fact, different studies lead to rather conflicting conclusions. Frakes [275] compares eight distinct studies on the potential benefits of stemming. While he favors the usage of stemming, the results of the eight experimental studies he investigated do not allow us to reach a satisfactory conclusion. As a result of these doubts, many Web search engines do not adopt any stemming algorithm whatsoever. Frakes distinguishes four types of stemming strategies: affix removal, table lookup, successor variety, and n-grams. Table lookup consists simply of looking for the stem of a word in a table. It is a simple procedure but one which is dependent on data on stems for the whole language. Since such data is not readily available and might require considerable storage space, this type of stemming algorithm might not be practical. Successor variety stemming is based on the determination of morpheme boundaries, uses knowledge from structural linguistics, and is more complex than affix removal stemming algorithms. N-grams stemming is based on the identification of digrams and trigrams and is more a term clustering procedure than a stemming one. Affix removal stemming is intuitive, simple, and can be implemented efficiently. Thus, in the remainder of this section we concentrate our discussion on algorithms for affix removal stemming only. In affix removal the most important part is suffix removal because most variants of a word are generated by the introduction of suffixes (instead of preDOCUMENT PREPROCESSING        169 fixes). While there are three or four well known suffix removal algorithms, the most popular one is that by Porter because of its simplicity and elegance. Despite being simpler, the Porter algorithm yields results comparable to those of the more sophisticated algorithms. The Porter algorithm uses a suffix list for suffix stripping. The idea is to apply a series of rules to the suffixes of the words in the text. For instance, the rule s ógt; 0                                                                                          (7.1) is used to convert plural forms into their respective singular forms by substituting the letter s by nil. Notice that to identify the suffix we must examine the last letters in the word. Furthermore, we look for the longest sequence of letters which matches the left hand side in a set of rules. Thus, application of the two following rules sses    ógt;    ss                                                                                                   (7.2) to the word stresses yields the stem stress instead of the stem stresse. By separating such rules into five distinct phases, the Porter algorithm is able to provide effective stemming while running fast. A detailed description of the Porter algorithm can be found in the appendix.
mir-0122	7.2.4    Index Terms Selection If a full text representation of the text is adopted then all words in the text are used as index terms. The alternative is to adopt a more abstract view in which not all words are used as index terms. This implies that the set of terms used as indices must be selected. In the area of bibliographic sciences, such a selection of index terms is usually done by a specialist. An alternative approach is to select candidates for index terms automatically. Distinct automatic approaches for selecting index terms can be used. A good approach is the identification of noun groups (as done in the Inquery system [122]) which we now discuss. A sentence in natural language text is usually composed of nouns, pronouns, articles, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and connectives. While the words in each grammatical class are used with a particular purpose, it can be argued that most of the semantics is carried by the noun words. Thus, an intuitively promising strategy for selecting index terms automatically is to use the nouns in the text. This can be done through the systematic elimination of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, connectives, articles, and pronouns. Since it is common to combine two or three nouns in a single component (e.g., computer science), it makes sense to cluster nouns which appear nearby in the text into a single indexing component (or concept). Thus, instead of simply 170        TEXT OPERATIONS using nouns as index terms, we adopt noun groups. A noun group is a set of nouns whose syntactic distance in the text (measured in terms of number of words between two nouns) does not exceed a predefined threshold (for instance, 3). When noun groups are adopted as indexing terms, we obtain a conceptual logical view of the documents in terms of sets of non-elementary index terms.
mir-0123	7.2.5    Thesauri The word thesaurus has Greek and Latin origins and is used as a reference to a treasury of words [261]. In its simplest form, this treasury consists of (1) a precompiled list of important words in a given domain of knowledge and (2) for each word in this list, a set of related words. Related words are, in its most common variation, derived from a synonymity relationship. In general, however, a thesaurus also involves some normalization of the vocabulary and includes a structure much more complex than a simple list of words and their synonyms. For instance, the popular thesaurus published by Peter Roget [679] also includes phrases which means that concepts more complex than single words are taken into account. Roget's thesaurus is of a general nature (i.e., not specific to a certain domain of knowledge) and organizes words and phrases in categories and subcategories. An example of an entry in Roget's thesaurus is as follows: cowardly adjective Ignobly lacking in courage: cowardly turncoats. Syns:   chicken (slang),  chicken-hearted,  craven,  dastardly,  fainthearted, gutless, lily-livered, pusillanimous, unmanly, yellow (slang), yellow-bellied (slang). To the adjective cowardly, Roget's thesaurus associates several synonyms which compose a thesaurus class. While Roget5s thesaurus is of a generic nature, a thesaurus can be specific to a certain domain of knowledge. For instance, the Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms covers concepts related to engineering and technical terminology. According to Foskett [261], the main purposes of a thesaurus are basically: (a) to provide a standard vocabulary (or system of references) for indexing and searching; (b) to assist users with locating terms for proper query formulation; and (c) to provide classified hierarchies that allow the broadening and narrowing of the current query request according to the needs of the user. In this section, however, we do not discuss how to use a thesaurus for modifying the user query. This issue is covered on Chapter 5 which also discusses algorithms for automatic construction of thesauri. Notice that the motivation for building a thesaurus is based on the fundamental idea of using a con trolled vocabulary for the indexing and searching. A controlled vocabulary presents important advantages such as normalization DOCUMENT PREPROCESSING         171 of indexing concepts, reduction of noise, identification of indexing terms with a clear semantic meaning, and retrieval based on concepts rather than on words. Such advantages are particularly important in specific domains, such as the medical domain for which there is already a large amount of knowledge compiled. For general domains, however, a well known body of knowledge which can be associated with the documents in the collection might not exist. The reasons might be that the document base is new, that it is too large, or that it changes very dynamically. This is exactly the case with the Web. Thus, it is not clear how useful a thesaurus is in the context of the Web. Despite that, the success of the search engine named 'Yahoo!' (see Chapter 13), which presents the user with a term classification hierarchy that can be used to reduce the space to be searched, suggests that thesaurus-based techniques might be quite useful even in the dynamic world of the Web. It is still too early to reach a consensus on the advantages of a thesaurus for the Web. As a result, many search engines simply use all the words in all the documents as index terms (i.e., there is no notion of using the concepts of a controlled vocabulary for indexing and searching purposes). Whether thesaurus-based techniques will flourish in the context of the Web remains to be seen. The main components of a thesaurus are its index terms, the relationships among the terms, and a layout design for these term relationships. Index terms and term relationships are covered below. The layout design for term relationships can be in the form of a list or in the form of a bi-dimensional display. Here, we consider only the more conventional layout structure based on a list and thus, do not further discuss the issue of layout of the terms in a thesaurus. A brief coverage of topics related to this problem can be found in Chapter 10. A more detailed discussion can be found in [261]. Theasurus Index Terms The terms are the indexing components of the thesaurus.   Usually, a term in a thesaurus is used to denote a concept which is the basic semantic unit for conveying ideas. Terms can be individual words, groups of words, or phrases, but most of them are single words. Further, terms are basically nouns because nouns are the most concrete part of speech. Terms can also be verbs in gerund form whenever they are used as nouns (for instance, acting, teaching, etc.). Whenever a concept cannot be expressed by a single word, a group of words is used instead. For instance, many concepts are better expressed by a combination of an adjective with a noun. A typical example is ballistic missiles. In this case, indexing the compound term directly will yield an entry under balistic and no entry under missiles which is clearly inadequate. To avoid this problem, the compound term is usually modified to have the noun as the first word. For instance, we can change the compound term to missiles, ballistic. We notice the use of the plural form missiles instead of the singular form missile. The reasoning is that a thesaurus represents classes of things and thus it is natural to prefer the plural form.   However, the singular form is used for 172        TEXT OPERATIONS compound terms which appear normally in the singular such as body temperature. Deciding between singular and plural is not always a simple matter. Besides the term itself, frequently it is necessary to complement a thesaurus entry with a definition or an explanation. The reason is the need to specify the precise meanings of a term in the context of a particular thesaurus. For instance, the term seal has a meaning in the context of marine animals and a rather distinct meaning in the context of documents. In these cases, the definition might be preceded by a context explanation such as seal (marine animals) and seal (documents) [735]. Thesaurus Term Relationships The set of terms related to a given thesaurus term is mostly composed of synonyms and near-synonyms. In addition to these, relationships can be induced by patterns of co-occurrence within documents. Such relationships are usually of a hierarchical nature and most often indicate broader (represented by BT) or narrower (represented by NT) related terms. However, the relationship might also be of a lateral or non-hierarchical nature. In this case, we simply say that the terms are related (represented by RT). As discussed in Chapter 5, BT and NT relationships define a classification hierarchy where the broader term is associated with a class and its related narrower terms are associated with the instances of this class. Further, it might be that a narrower term is associated with two or more broader terms (which is not the most common case though). While BT and NT relationships can be identified in a fully automatic manner (i.e., without assistance from a human subject), dealing with RT relationships is much harder. One reason seems to be that RT relationships are dependent on the specific context and particular needs of the group of users and thus are difficult to identify without knowledge provided by specialists. On the Use of Thesauri in IR As described by Peter Roget [679, 261], a thesaurus is a classification scheme composed of words and phrases whose organization aims at facilitating the expression of ideas in written text.   Thus, whenever a writer has a difficulty in finding the proper term to express an idea (a common occurrence in serious writing), he can use the thesaurus to obtain a better grasp on the fundamental semantics of terms related to his idea. In the area of information retrieval, researchers have for many years conjectured and studied the usefulness of a thesaurus for helping with the query formation process. Whenever a user wants to retrieve a set of documents, he first builds up a conceptualization of what he is looking for. Such conceptualization is what we call his information need. Given the information need, the user still lias to translate it into a query in the language of the IR system. This usually DOCUMENT CLUSTERING         173 means that a set of index terms has to be selected. However, since the collection might be vast and the user inexperienced, the selection of such initial terms might be erroneous and improper (a very common situation with the largely unknown and highly dynamic collection of documents and pages which compose the Web). In this case, reformulating the original query seems to be a promising course of action. Such a reformulation process usually implies expanding the original query with related terms. Thus, it seems natural to use a thesaurus for assisting the user with the search for related terms. Unfortunately, this approach does not work well in general because the relationships captured in a thesaurus frequently are not valid in the local context of a given user query. One alternative is to determine thesaurus-like relationships at query time. Unfortunately, such an alternative is not attractive for Web search engines which cannot afford to spend a lot of time with the processing of individual queries. This and many other interesting issues related to the use of thesaurus-based techniques in IR are covered in Chapter 5.
mir-0124	7.3    Document Clustering Document clustering is the operation of grouping together similar (or related) documents in classes. In this regard, document clustering is not really an operation on the text but an operation on the collection of documents. The operation of clustering documents is usually of two types: global and local. In a global clustering strategy, the documents are grouped accordingly to their occurrence in the wrhole collection. In a local clustering strategy, the grouping of documents is affected by the context defined by the current query and its local set of retrieved documents. Clustering methods are usually used in IR to transform the original query in an attempt to better represent the user information need. From this perspective, clustering is an operation which is more related to the transformation of the user query than to the transformation of the text of the documents. In this book, document clustering techniques are treated as query operations and thus, are covered in Chapter 5 (instead of here).
mir-0126	7.4.1    Motivation Text compression is about finding ways to represent the text in fewer bits or bytes. The amount of space required to store text on computers can be reduced significantly using compression techniques. Compression methods create a reduced representation by identifying and using structures that exist in the text. From the compressed version, the original text can be reconstructed exactly. Text compression is becoming an important issue in an information retrieval environment.   The widespread use of digital libraries, office automation 174        TEXT OPERATIONS systems, document databases, and the Web has led to an explosion of textual information available online. In this scenario, text compression appears as an attractive option for reducing costs associated with space requirements, input/output (I/O) overhead, and communication delays. The gain obtained from compressing text is that it requires less storage space, it takes less time to be transmitted over a communication link, and it takes less time to search directly the compressed text. The price paid is the time necessary to code and decode the text. A major obstacle for storing text in compressed form is the need for IR systems to access text randomly. To access a given word in a compressed text, it is usually necessary to decode the entire text from the beginning until the desired word is reached. It could be argued that a large text could be divided into blocks that are compressed independently, thus allowing fast random access to each block. However, efficient compression methods need to process some text before making compression effective (usually more than 10 kilobytes). The smaller the blocks, the less effective compression is expected to be. Our discussion here focuses on text compression methods which are suitable for use in an IR environment. For instance, a successful idea aimed at merging the requirements of compression algorithms and the needs of IR systems is to consider that the symbols to be compressed are words and not characters (character-based compression is the more conventional approach). Words are the atoms on which most IR systems are built. Moreover, it is now known that much better compression is achieved by taking words as symbols (instead of characters). Further, new word-based compression methods allow random access to words within the compressed text which is a critical issue for an IR system. Besides the economy of space obtained by a compression method, there are other important characteristics to be considered such as compression and decompression speed. In some situations, decompression speed is more important than compression speed. For instance, this is the case with textual databases in which it is common to compress the text once and to read it many times from disk. Another important characteristic of a compression method is the possibility of performing compressed pattern matching, defined as the task of performing pattern matching in a compressed text without decompressing it. In this case, sequential searching can be speeded up by compressing the search key rather than decoding the compressed text being searched. As a consequence, it is possible to search faster on compressed text because much less text has to be scanned. Chapter 8 presents efficient methods to deal with searching the compressed text directly. When the text collection is large, efficient text retrieval requires specialized index techniques. A simple and popular indexing structure for text collections are the inverted files. Inverted files (see Chapter 8 for details) are especially adequate when the pattern to be searched for is formed by simple words. Since this is a common type of query (for instance, when searching the Web), inverted files are widely used for indexing large text collections. An inverted file is typically composed of (a) a vector containing all the distinct words in the text collection (which is called the vocabulary) and (b) for TEXT COMPRESSION        175 each word in the vocabulary, a list of all documents (identified by document numbers) in which that word occurs. Because each list of document numbers (within the inverted file) is organized in ascending order, specific compression methods have been proposed for them, leading to very efficient index compression schemes. This is important because query processing time is highly related to index access time. Thus, in this section, we also discuss some of the most important index compression techniques. We first introduce basic concepts related to text compression. We then present some of the most important statistical compression methods, followed by a brief review of compression methods based on a dictionary. At the end, we discuss the application of compression to inverted files.
mir-0127	7.4.2    Basic Concepts There are two general approaches to text compression: statistical and dictionary based. Statistical methods rely on generating good probability estimates (of appearance in the text) for each symbol. The more accurate the estimates are, the better the compression obtained. A symbol here is usually a character, a text word, or a fixed number of characters. The set of all possible symbols in the text is called the alphabet The task of estimating the probability on each next symbol is called modeling. A model is essentially a collection of probability distributions, one for each context in which a symbol can be coded. Once these probabilities are available the symbols are converted into binary digits, a process called coding. In practice, both the encoder and decoder use the same model. The decoder interprets the output of the encoder (with reference to the same model) to find out the original symbol. There are two well known statistical coding strategies: Huffman coding and arithmetic coding. The idea of Huffman coding is to assign a fixed-length bit encoding to each different symbol of the text. Compression is achieved by assigning a smaller number of bits to symbols with higher probabilities of appearance. Huffman coding was first proposed in the early 1950s and was the most important compression method until the late 1970s, when arithmetic coding made higher compression rates possible. Arithmetic coding computes the code incrementally, one symbol at a time, as opposed to the Huffman coding scheme in which each different symbol is pre-encoded using a fixed-length number of bits. The incremental nature does not allow decoding a string which starts in the middle of a compressed file. To decode a symbol in the middle of a file compressed with arithmetic coding, it is necessary to decode the whole text from the very beginning until the desired word is reached. This characteristic makes arithmetic coding inadequate for use in an IR environment. Dictionary methods substitute a sequence of symbols by a pointer to a previous occurrence of that sequence. The pointer representations are references to entries in a dictionary composed of a list of symbols (often called phrases) that are expected to occur frequently.   Pointers to the dictionary entries are 176        TEXT OPERATIONS chosen so that they need less space than the phrase they replace, thus obtaining compression. The distinction between modeling and coding does not exist in dictionary methods and there are no explicit probabilities associated to phrases. The most well known dictionary methods are represented by a family of methods, known as the Ziv-Lempel family. Character-based Huffman methods are typically able to compress English texts to approximately five bits per character (usually, each uncompressed character takes 7-8 bits to be represented). More recently, a word-based Huffman method has been proposed as a better alternative for natural language texts. This method is able to reduce English texts to just over two bits per character. As we will see later on, word-based Huffman coding achieves compression rates close to the entropy and allows random access to intermediate points in the compressed text. Ziv-Lempel methods are able to reduce English texts to fewer than four bits per character. Methods based on arithmetic coding can also compress English texts to just over two bits per character. However, the price paid is slower compression and decompression, and the impossibility of randomly accessing intermediate points in the compressed text. Before proceeding, let us present an important definition which will be useful from now on. Definition Compression ratio is the size of the compressed file as a fraction of the uncompressed file.
mir-0128	7.4.3    Statistical Methods In a statistical method, a probability is estimated for each symbol (the modeling task) and, based on this probability, a code is assigned to each symbol at a time (the coding task). Shorter codes are assigned to the most likely symbols. The relationship between probabilities and codes was established by Claude Shannon in his source code theorem [718]. He showed that, in an optimal encoding scheme, a symbol that is expected to occur with probability p should be assigned a code of length iog2 ^ bits. The number of bits in which a symbol is best coded represents the information content of the symbol. The average amount of information per symbol over the whole alphabet is called the entropy of the probability distribution, and is given by: 1 2 Pi E is a lower bound on compression , measured in bits per symbol, which applies to any coding method based on the probability distribution pt. It is important to note that E is calculated from the probabilities and so is a property of the model. See Chapter 6 for more details on this topic. TEXT COMPRESSION        177 Modeling The basic function of a model is to provide a probability assignment for the next symbol to be coded. High compression can be obtained by forming good models of the text that is to be coded. The probability assignment is explained in the following section. Compression models can be adaptive, static, or semi-static. Adaptive models start with no information about the text and progressively learn about its statistical distribution as the compression process goes on. Thus, adaptive models need only one pass over the text and store no additional information apart from the compressed text. For long enough texts, such models converge to the true statistical distribution of the text. One major disadvantage, however, is that decompression of a file has to start from its beginning, since information on the distribution of the data is stored incrementally inside the file. Adaptive modeling is a good option for general purpose compression programs, but an inadequate alternative for full-text retrieval where random access to compressed patterns is a must. Static models assume an average distribution for all input texts. The modeling phase is done only once for all texts to be coded in the future (i.e., somehow a probability distribution is estimated and then used for all texts to be compressed in the future). These models tend to achieve poor compression ratios when the data deviates from initial statistical assumptions. For example, a model adequate for English literary texts will probably perform poorly for financial texts containing a lot of different numbers, as each number is relatively rare and so receives long codes. Semi-static models do not assume any distribution on the data, but learn it in a first pass . In a second pass, they compress the data by using a fixed code derived from the distribution learned from the first pass. At decoding time, information on the data distribution is sent to the decoder before transmitting the encoded symbols. The disadvantages of semi-static models are that they must make two passes over the text and that information on the data distribution must be stored to be used by the decoder to decompress. In situations where interactive data communications are involved it may be impractical to make two passes over the text. However, semi-static models have a crucial advantage in IR contexts: since the same codes are used at every point in the compressed file, direct access is possible. Word-based models take words instead of characters as symbols. Usually, a word is a contiguous string of characters in the set {A..Z, a..z} separated by other characters not in the set {A..Z, a..z}. There are many good reasons to use word-based models in an IR context. First, much better compression rates are achieved by taking words as symbols because words carry a lot of meaning in natural languages and, as a result, their distribution is much more related to the semantic structure of the text than the individual letters. Second, words are the atoms on which most information retrieval systems are built. Words are already stored for indexing purposes and so might be used as part of the model for compression. Third, the word frequencies are also useful in answering queries involving combinations of words because the best strategy is to start with the 178        TEXT OPERATIONS least frequent words first. Since the text is not only composed of words but also of separators, a model must also be chosen for them. There are many different ways to deal with separators. As words and separators always follow one another, two different alphabets are usually used: one for words and one for separators. Consider the following example: each rose, a rose is a rose. In the word-based model, the set of symbols of the alphabet is {a, each, is, rose}, whose frequencies are 2, 1, 1, and 3, respectively, and the set of separators is {',LJ\ U}, whose frequencies are 1 and 5, respectively (where U represents a space). Once it is known that the text starts with a word or a separator, there is confusion about which alphabet to use. In natural language texts, a word is followed by a single space in most cases. In the texts of the TREC-3 collection [342] (see Chapter 3), 70-80% of the separators are single spaces. Another good alternative is to consider the single space that follows a word as part of the same word. That is, if a word is followed by a space, we can encode just the word. If not, we can encode the word and then the following separator. At decoding time, we decode a word and assume that a space follows unless the next symbol corresponds to a separator. Notice that now a single alphabet for words and separators (single space excluded) is used. For instance, in the example above, the single alphabet is {',LJ', a, each, is, rose} and there is no longer an alphabet for separators. As the alphabet excludes the single space then the words are called spaceless words. In some situations word-based models for full-text databases have a potential to generate a great quantity of different codes and care must be exercised to deal with this fact. For instance, as discussed in the section on lexical analysis (at the beginning of this chapter), one has to consider whether a sequence of digits is to be considered as a word. If it is, then a collection which contains one million documents and includes document numbers as identifiers will generate one million words composed solely of digits, each one occurring once in the collection. This can be very inefficient for any kind of compression method available. One possible good solution is to divide long numbers into shorter ones by using a null (or implicit) punctuation marker in between. This diminishes the alphabet size resulting in considerable improvements in the compression ratio and in the decoding time. Another important consideration is the size of the alphabet in word-based schemes. How large is the number of different words in a full-text database? It is empirically known that the vocabulary V of natural language texts with n words grows sublinearly. Heaps [352] shows that V = O(nd), where 0 is a constant dependent on the particular text. For the 2 gigabyte TREC-3 collection [342], p is between 0.4 and 0.6 which means that the alphabet size grows roughly proportional to the square root of n. Even for this growth of the alphabet, the generalized Zipf law shows that the probability distribution is skewed so that the entropy remains constant. This implies that the compression ratio does not degrade as the text (and hence the number of different symbols) grows. Heaps' and Zipfs' laws are explained in Chapter 6. Finally, it is important to mention that word-based Huffman methods need large texts to be effective (i.e., they are not adequate to compress and transmit TEXT COMPRESSION        179 a single Web page over a network). The need to store the vocabulary represents an important space overhead when the text is small (say, less than 10 megabytes). However, this is not a concern in IR in general as the texts are large and the vocabulary is needed anyway for other purposes such as indexing and querying. Coding Coding corresponds to the task of obtaining the representation (code) of a symbol based on a probability distribution given by a model. The main goal of a coder is to assign short codes to likely symbols and long codes to unlikely ones. As we have seen in the previous section, the entropy of a probability distribution is a lower bound on how short the average length of a code can be, and the quality of a coder is measured in terms of how close to the entropy it is able to get. Another important consideration is the speed of both the coder and the decoder. Sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice the compression ratio to reduce the time to encode and decode the text. A semi-static Huffman compression method works in two passes over the text. In a first pass, the modeler determines the probability distribution of the symbols and builds a coding tree according to this distribution. In a second pass, each next symbol is encoded according to the coding tree. Adaptive Huffman compression methods, instead, work in one single pass over the text updating the coding tree incrementally. The encoding of the symbols in the input text is also done during this single pass over the text. The main problem of adaptive Huffman methods is the cost of updating the coding tree as new symbols are read. As with Huffman-based methods, arithmetic coding methods can also be based on static, semi-static or adaptive algorithms. The main strength of arithmetic coding methods is that they can generate codes which are arbitrarily close to the entropy for any kind of probability distribution. Another strength of arithmetic coding methods is that they do not need to store a coding tree explicitly. For adaptive algorithms, this implies that arithmetic coding uses less memory than Huffman-based coding. For static or semi-static algorithms, the use of canonical Huffman codes overcomes this memory problem (canonical Huffman trees are explained later on). In arithmetic coding, the input text is represented by an interval of real numbers between 0 and 1. As the size of the input becomes larger, the interval becomes smaller and the number of bits needed to specify this interval increases. Compression is achieved because input symbols with higher probabilities reduce the interval less than symbols with smaller probabilities and hence add fewer bits to the output code. Arithmetic coding presents many disadvantages over Huffman coding in an IR environment. First, arithmetic coding is much slower than Huffman coding, especially with static and semi-static algorithms. Second, with arithmetic coding, decompression cannot start in the middle of a compressed file. This contrasts with Huffman coding, in which it is possible to index and to decode from 180        TEXT OPERATIONS any position in the compressed text if static or semi-static algorithms are used. Third, word-based Huffman coding methods yield compression ratios as good as arithmetic coding ones. Consequently, Huffman coding is the method of choice in full-text retrieval, where both speed and random access are important. Thus, we will focus the remaining of our discussion on semi-static word-based Huffman coding. Huffman Coding Huffman coding is one of the best known compression methods [386]. The idea is to assign a variable-length encoding in bits to each symbol and encode each symbol in turn. Compression is achieved by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols. Decompression uniqueness is guaranteed because no code is a prefix of another. A word-based semi-static model and Huffman coding form a good compression method for text. Figure 7.2 presents an example of compression using Huffman coding on words. In this example the set of symbols of the alphabet is {l, LJ\ a, each, for, is, rose}, whose frequencies are 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, and 3, respectively. In this case the alphabet is unique for words and separators. Notice that the separator *U' is not part of the alphabet because the single space that follows a word is considered as part of the word. These words are called spaceless words (see more about spaceless words in Section 7.4.3). The Huffman tree shown in Figure 7.2 is an example of a binary trie built on binary codes. Tries are explained in Chapter 8. Decompression is accomplished as follows. The stream of bits in the compressed file is traversed from left to right. The sequence of bits read is used to also traverse the Huffman compression tree, starting at the root. Whenever a leaf node is reached, the corresponding word (which constitutes the decompressed symbol) is printed out and the tree traversal is restarted. Thus, according to the tree in Figure 7.2, the presence of the code 0110 in the compressed file leads to the decompressed symbol for. To build a Huffman tree, it is first necessary to obtain the symbols that constitute the alphabet and their probability distribution in the text to be compressed. The algorithm for building the tree then operates bottom up and starts Original text:           for each, rose,  a rose Is a rose Compressed text:     0110 0100 1 0101 00 1 0111 00 1 Figure 7.2    Huffman coding tree for spaceless words. TEXT COMPRESSION 181 by creating for each symbol of the alphabet a node containing the symbol and its probability (or frequency). At this point there is a forest of one-node trees whose probabilities sum up to 1. Next, the two nodes with the smallest probabilities become children of a newly created parent node. With this parent node is associated a probability equal to the sum of the probabilities of the two chosen children. The operation is repeated ignoring nodes that are already children, until there is only one node, which becomes the root of the decoding tree. By delaying the pairing of nodes with high probabilities, the algorithm necessarily places them closer to the root node, making their code smaller. The two branches from every internal node are consistently labeled 0 and 1 (or 1 and 0). Given s symbols and their frequencies in the text, the algorithm builds the Huffman tree in O(slogs) time. The number of Huffman trees which can be built for a given probability distribution is quite large. This happens because interchanging left and right subtrees of any internal node results in a different tree whenever the two subtrees are different in structure, but the weighted average code length is not affected. Instead of using any kind of tree, the preferred choice for most applications is to adopt a canonical tree which imposes a particular order to the coding bits. A Huffman tree is canonical when the height of the left subtree of any node is never smaller than that of the right subtree, and all leaves are in increasing order of probabilities from left to right. Figure 7.3 shows the canonical tree for the example of Figure 7.2. The deepest leaf at the leftmost position of the Huffman canonical tree, corresponding to one element with smallest probability, will contain only zeros, and the following codes will be in increasing order inside each level. At each change of level we shift left one bit in the counting. The table in Figure 7.3 shows the canonical codes for the example of Figure 7.2. A canonical code can be represented by an ordered sequence S of pairs (xl,yl), 1 lt; i lt; t, where xi represents the number of symbols at level ?\ y% represents the numerical value of the first code at level i, and £ is the height of the tree. For our example in Figure 7.3, the ordered sequence is S = ((1,1),( 1,1),((), oo), (4,0)). For instance, the fourth pair (4,0) in 5 corresponds to the fourth level and indicates that there are four nodes at this level and that to the node most to the left is assigned a code, at this level, with value 0. Since this is the fourth level, a value 0 corresponds to the codeword 0000. Symbol	Prob.

One of the properties of canonical codes is that the set of codes having the same length are the binary representations of consecutive integers. Interpreted as integers, the 4-bit codes of the table in Figure 7.3 are 0, 1, 2, and 3, the 2-bit code is 1 and the 1-bit code is also 1. In our example, if the first character read from the input stream is 1, a codeword has been identified and the corresponding symbol can be output. If this value is 0, a second bit is appended and the two bits are again interpreted as an integer and used to index the table and identify the corresponding symbol Once we read C00! we know that the code has four bits and therefore we can read two more bits and use them as an index into the table. This fact can be exploited to enable efficient encoding and decoding with small overhead. Moreover, much less memory is required, which is especially important for large vocabularies. Byte-Oriented Huffman Code The original method proposed by Huffman [386] leads naturally to binary coding trees. In [577], however, it is proposed to build the code assigned to each symbol as a sequence of whole bytes. As a result, the Huffman tree has degree 256 instead of 2. Typically, the code assigned to each symbol contains between 1 and o bytes. For example, a possible code for the word rose could be the 3-byte code k47 131 8/ The construct ion of byte Huffman trees involves some details which must be dealt with. Care must be exercised to ensure that the first levels of the tree have no empty nodes when the code is not binary. Figure 7.4(a) illustrates a ease where a naive extension of the binary Huffman tree construction algorithm might generate a non-optimal byte tree. In this example the alphabet has 512 symbols, all with tiie same probability. The root node has 254 empty spaces that could be occupied by symbols from the second level of the tree, changing their code lengths from 2 bytes to 1 byte. A way to ensure that the empty nodes always go to the lowest level of the tree follows. We calculate beforehand the number of empty nodes that will arise. TEXT COMPRESSION        183 We then compose these empty nodes with symbols of smallest probabilities (for moving the empty nodes to the deepest level of the final tree). To accomplish this, we need only to select a number of symbols equal to 1 + ((v - 256) mod 255), where v is the total number of symbols (i.e., the size of the vocabulary), for composing with the empty nodes. For instance, in the example in Figure 7.4(a), we have that 2 elements must be coupled with 254 empty nodes in the first step (because, 1 -f ((512 - 256) mod 255) = 2). The remaining steps are similar to the binary Huffman tree construction algorithm. All techniques for efficient encoding and decoding mentioned previously can easily be extended to handle word-based byte Huffman coding. Moreover, no significant decrease of the compression ratio is experienced by using bytes instead of bits when the symbols are words. Further, decompression of byte Huffman code is faster than decompression of binary Huffman code. In fact, compression and decompression are very fast and compression ratios achieved are better than those of the Ziv-Lempel family [848, 849]. In practice byte processing is much faster than bit processing because bit shifts and masking operations are not necessary at decoding time or at searching time. One important consequence of using byte Huffman coding is the possibility of performing direct searching on compressed text. The searching algorithm is explained in Chapter 8. The exact search can be done on the compressed text directly, using any known sequential pattern matching algorithm. Moreover, it allows a large number of variations of the exact and approximate compressed pattern matching problem, such as phrases, ranges, complements, wild cards, and arbitrary regular expressions. The algorithm is based on a word-oriented shift-or algorithm and on a fast Boyer-Moore-type filter. For approximate searching on the compressed text it is eight times faster than an equivalent approximate searching on the uncompressed text, thanks to the use of the vocabulary by the algorithm [577, 576]. This technique is not only useful in speeding up sequential search. It can also be used to improve indexed schemes that combine inverted files and sequential search, like Glimpse [540].
mir-0129	7.4.4    Dictionary Methods Dictionary methods achieve compression by replacing groups of consecutive symbols (or phrases) with a pointer to an entry in a dictionary. Thus, the central decision in the design of a dictionary method is the selection of entries in the dictionary. The choice of phrases can be made by static, semi-adaptive, or adaptive algorithms. The simplest dictionary schemes use static dictionaries containing short phrases. Static dictionary encoders are fast as they demand little effort for achieving a small amount of compression. One example that has been proposed several times in different forms is the digram coding, where selected pairs of letters are replaced with codewords. At each step the next two characters are inspected and verified if they correspond to a digram in the dictionary. If so, they are coded together and the coding position is shifted by two characters: otherwise, the single character is represented by its normal code and the coding 184        TEXT OPERATIONS position is shifted by one character. The main problem with static dictionary encoders is that the dictionary might be suitable for one text and unsuitable for another. One way to avoid this problem is to use a semi-static dictionary scheme, constructing a new dictionary for each text to be compressed. However, the problem of deciding which phrases should be put in the dictionary is not an easy task at all. One elegant solution to this problem is to use an adaptive dictionary scheme, such as the one proposed in the 1970s by Ziv and Lempel. The Ziv-Lempel type of adaptive dictionary scheme uses the idea of replacing strings of characters with a reference to a previous occurrence of the string. This approach is effective because most characters can be coded as part of a string that has occurred earlier in the text. If the pointer to an earlier occurrence of a string is stored in fewer bits than the string it replaces then compression is achieved. Adaptive dictionary methods present some disadvantages over the statistical word-based Huffman method. First, they do not allow decoding to start in the middle of a compressed file. As a consequence direct access to a position in the compressed text is not possible, unless the entire text is decoded from the beginning until the desired position is reached. Second, dictionary schemes are still popular for their speed and economy of memory, but the new results in statistical methods make them the method of choice in an IR environment. Moreover, the improvement of computing technology will soon make statistical methods feasible for general use, and the interest in dictionary methods will eventually decrease.
mir-0130	7.4.5    Inverted File Compression As already discussed, an inverted file is typically composed of (a) a vector containing all the distinct words in the text collection (which is called the vocabulary) and (b) for each word in the vocabulary, a list of all documents in which that word occurs. Inverted files are widely used to index large text files. The size of an inverted file can be reduced by compressing the inverted lists. Because the list of document numbers within the inverted list is in ascending order, it can also be considered as a sequence of gaps between document numbers. Since processing is usually done sequentially starting from the beginning of the list, the original document numbers can always be recomputed through sums of the gaps. By observing that these gaps are small for frequent words and large for infrequent words, compression can be obtained by encoding small values with shorter codes. One possible coding scheme for this case is the unary cade, in which an integer x is coded as (x - 1) one bits followed by a zero bit, so the code for the Integer 3 is 110. The second column of Table 7.1 shows unary codes for integers between 1 and 10. Elias [235] presented two other variable-length coding schemes for integers. One is Elias-^ code, which represents the number j by a concatenation of two TEXT COMPRESSION 185 Gap x	Unary	Elias-7	Elias-lt;5	Golomb 6=3 1	0	0	0	00 2	10	100	1000	010 3	110	101	1001	Oil 4	1110	11000	10100	100 5	11110	11001	10101	1010 6	111110	11010	10110	1011 7	1111110	11011	10111	1100 8	11111110	1110000	11000000	11010 9	111111110	1110001	11000001	11011 10	1111111110	1110010	11000010	11100 Table 7.1    Example codes for integers. parts: (1) a unary code for 1+ LlogxJ and (2) a code of [log reJ bits that represents the value of x - 2Llos*J in binary. For x = 5, we have that 1 -h [logxj = 3 and that x - 2LlosxJ = 1. Thus, the Elias-7 code for x = 5 is generated by combining the unary code for 3 (code 110) with the 2-bits binary number for 1 (code 01) which yields the codeword 11001. Other examples of Elias-7 codes are shown in Table 7.1. The other coding scheme introduced by Elias is the Elias-5 code, which represents the prefix indicating the number of binary bits by the Elias-7 code rather than the unary code. For x = 5, the first part is then 101 instead of 110. Thus, the Elias-5 codeword for x = 5 is 10101. In general, the Elias-5 code for an arbitrary integer x requires 1 -f 2[loglog2xJ + [log xj bits. Table 7.1 shows other examples of Elias~lt;$ codes. In general, for small values of x the Elias-7 codes are shorter than the Elias-£ codes. However, in the limit, as x becomes large, the situation is reversed. Golomb [307] presented another run-length coding method for positive integers. The Golomb code is very effective when the probability distribution is geometric. With inverted files, the likelihood of a gap being of size x can be computed as the probability of having x - 1 non-occurrences (within consecutively numbered documents) of that particular word followed by one occurrence. If a word occurs within a document with a probability p, the probability of a gap of size x is then Pr[x\={l-pf~lp which is the geometric distribution. In this case, the model is parameterized and makes use of the actual density of pointers in the inverted file. Let N be the number of documents in the system and V be the size of the vocabulary. Then, the probability p that any randomly selected document contains any randomly 186        TEXT OPERATIONS chosen term can be estimated as number of pointers P==            N x V where the number of pointers represent the 'size' of the index. The Golomb method works as follows. For some parameter b, a gap x gt; 0 is coded as q -h 1 in unary, where q = [(x ó 1)/6J, followed by r = (x ó 1) ó q x b coded in binary, requiring either [logb] or ("log b] bits. That is, if r lt; 2 Llos £gt;j ó i then the number coded in binary requires [logfrj bits, otherwise it requires flog b] bits where the first bit is 1 and the remaining bits assume the value r ó 2'-los^~1 coded in [logb\ binary digits. For example, with b = 3 there are three possible remainders, and those are coded as 0, 10, and 11, for r = 0, r = 1, and r = 2, respectively. Similarly, for b = 5 there are five possible remainders r, 0 through 4, and these are assigned codes 00, 01, 100, 101, and 110. Then, if the value x = 9 is to be coded relative to 6 = 3, calculation yields q = 2 and r == 2, because 9-1 = 2 x 3 + 2. Thus, the encoding is 110 followed by 11. Relative to b = 5, the values calculated are q = 1 and r = 1, resulting in a code of 10 followed by 101. To operate with the Golomb compression method, it is first necessary to establish the parameter b for each term. For gap compression, an appropriate value is b ´ 0.69(Ar//t)^ where N is the total number of documents and ft is the number of documents that contain term t. Witten, Moffat and Bell [825] present a detailed study of different text collections. For all of their practical work on compression of inverted lists, they use Golomb code for the list of gaps. In this case Golomb code gives better compression than either Elias-7 or Elias-£. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring two passes to be generated, since it requires knowledge of ft, the number of documents containing term t. Moffat and Bell [572] show that the index for the 2 gigabytes TREC-3 collection, which contains 162,187,989 pointers and 894,406 distinct terms, when coded with Golomb code, occupies 132 megabytes. Considering the average number of bits per pointer, they obtained 5.73, 6.19, and 6.43 using Golomb, Elias-$, and Elias-7, respectively.
mir-0131	7.5    Comparing Text Compression Techniques Table 7.2 presents a comparison between arithmetic coding, character-based Huffman coding, word-based Huffman coding, and Ziv-Lempel coding, considering the aspects of compression ratio, compression speed, decompression speed, memory space overhead, compressed pattern matching capability, and random access capability. One important objective of any compression method is to be able to obtain good compression ratios. It seems that two bits per character (or 25% compression ratio) is a very good result for natural language texts. Thus, 'very good" in the context of Table 7.2 means a compression ratio under 30%-, 'good' means a compression ratio between 30% and 45%, and 'poor' means a compression ratio over 45%. COMPARING TEXT COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES         187 Character	Word Arithmetic	Huffman	Huffman	Ziv-Lempel Compression ratio	very good	poor	very good	good Compression speed	slow	fast	fast	very fast Decompression speed	slow	fast	very fast	very fast Memory space	low	low	high	moderate Compressed pat. matching	no	yes	yes	yes Random access	no	yes	yes	no Table 7.2    Comparison of the main techniques. Two other important characteristics of a compression method are compression and decompression speeds. Measuring the speed of various compression methods is difficult because it depends on the implementation details of each method, the compiler used, the computer architecture of the machine used to run the program, and so on. Considering compression speed, the LZ78 methods (Unix compress is an example) are among the fastest. Considering decompression speed, the LZ77 methods (gzip is an example) from the Ziv-Lempel are among the fastest. For statistical methods (e.g., arithmetic and semi-static Huffman) the compression time includes the cost of the first pass during which the probability distribution of the symbols are obtained. With two passes over the text to compress, the Huffman-based methods are slower than some Ziv-Lempel methods, but not very far behind. On the other hand, arithmetic methods are slower than Huffman methods because of the complexity of arithmetic coding compared with canonical Huffman coding. Considering decompression speed, word-based Huffman methods are as fast as Ziv-Lempel methods, while character-based Huffman methods are slower than word-based Huffman methods. Again, the complexity of arithmetic coding make them slower than Huffman coding during decompression. All Ziv-Lempel compression methods require a moderate amount of memory during encoding and decoding to store tables containing previously occurring strings. In general, more detailed tables that require more memory for storage yield better compression. Statistical methods store the probability distribution of the symbols of the text during the modeling phase, and the model during both compression and decompression phases. Consequently, the amount of memory depends on the size of the vocabulary of the text in each case, which is high for word-based models and low for character-based models. In an IR environment, two important considerations are whether the compression method allows efficient random access and direct searching on compressed text (or compressed pattern matching). Huffman methods allow random access and decompression can start anywhere in the middle of a compressed file, while arithmetic coding and Ziv-Lempel methods cannot. More recently, practical, efficient, and flexible direct searching methods on compressed texts have been discovered for word-based Huffman compression [575. 576, 577]. 188        TEXT OPERATIONS Direct searching has also been proposed for Ziv-Lempel methods, but only on a theoretical basis, with no implementation of the algorithms [250, 19]. More recently, Navarro and Raffinot [592] presented some preliminary implementations of algorithms to search directly Ziv-Lempel compressed text. Their algorithms are twice as fast as decompressing and searching, but slower than searching the decompressed text. They are also able to extract data from the middle of the compressed text without necessarily decompressing everything, and although some previous text has to be decompressed (i.e., it is not really 'direct access'), the amount of work is proportional to the size of the text to be decompressed (and not to its position in the compressed text).
mir-0132	7.6    Trends and Research issues In this chapter we covered various text transformation techniques which we call simply text operations. We first discussed five distinct text operations for preprocessing a document text and generating a set of index terms for searching and querying purposes. These five text operations were here called lexical analysis, elimination of stopwords, stemming, selection of index terms, and thesauri. The first four are directly related to the generation of a good set of index terms. The fifth, construction of a thesaurus, is more related to the building of categorization hierarchies which are used for capturing term relationships. These relationships can then be used for expanding the user query (manually or automatically) towards a formulation which better suits the user information need. Nowadays, there is controversy regarding the potential improvements to retrieval performance generated by stopwords elimination, stemming, and index terms selection. In fact, there is no conclusive evidence that such text operations yield consistent improvements in retrieval performance. As a result, modern retrieval systems might not use these text operations at all. A good example of this trend is the fact that some Web search engines index all the words in the text regardless of their syntactic nature or their role in the text. Furthermore, it is also not clear that automatic query expansion using thesaurus-based techniques can yield improved retrieval performance. The same cannot be said of the use of a thesaurus to directly assist the user with the query formation process. In fact, the success of the k Yahoo!' Web search engine, which uses a term categorization hierarchy to show term relationships to the user, is an indication that thesaurus-based techniques might be quite useful with the highly interactive interfaces being developed for modern digital library systems. We also briefly discussed the operation of clustering. Since clustering is more an operation of grouping documents than an operation of text transformation, we did not cover it thoroughly here. For a more complete coverage of clustering the reader is referred to Chapter 5. One text operation rather distinct from the previous ones is compression. While the previous text operations aim, in one form or another, at improving the quality of the answer set, the operation of compressing text aims at reducing space. I/O, communication costs, and searching faster in the compressed text (exactly or approximately). In fact, the gain obtained from compressing text is BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        189 that it requires less storage space, takes less time to be transmitted, and permits efficient direct and sequential access to compressed text. For effective operation in an IR environment, a compression method should satisfy the following requirements: good compression ratio, fast coding, fast decoding, fast random access without the need to decode from the beginning, and direct searching without the need to decompress the compressed text. A good compression ratio saves space in secondary storage and reduces communication costs. Fast coding reduces processing overhead due to the introduction of compression into the system. Sometimes, fast decoding is more important than fast coding, as in documentation systems in which a document is compressed once and decompressed many times from disk. Fast random access allows efficient processing of multiple queries submitted by the users of the information system. We compared various compression schemes using these requirements as parameters. We have seen that it is much faster to search sequentially a text compressed by a word-based byte Huffman encoding scheme than to search the uncompressed version of the text. Our discussion suggests that word-based byte Huffman compression (which has been introduced only very recently) shows great promise as an effective compression scheme for modern information retrieval systems. We also discussed the application of compression to index structures such as inverted files. Inverted files are composed of several inverted lists which are themselves formed by document numbers organized in ascending order. By coding the difference between these document numbers, efficient compression can be attained. The main trends in text compression today are the use of semi-static word-based modeling and Huffman coding. The new results in statistical methods, such as byte-Huffman coding, suggest that they are preferable methods for use in an IR environment. Further, with the possibility now of directly searching the compressed text, and the recent work [790] of Vo and Moffat on efficient manipulation of compressed indices, the trend is towards maintaining both the index and the text compressed at all times, unless the user wants to visualize the uncompressed text.
mir-0133	7.7    Bibliographic Discussion Our discussion on lexical analysis and elimination of stopwords is based on the work of Fox [263]. For stemming, we based our discussion on the work of Frakes [274]. The Porter stemming algorithm detailed in the appendix is from [648], while our coverage of thesauri is based on the work of Foskett [261], Here, however, we did not cover automatic generation of thesauri. Such discussion can be found in Chapter 5 and in [739, 735]. Additional discussion on the usefulness of thesauri is presented in [419, 735]. Regarding text compression, several books are available. Most of the topics discussed here are covered in more detail by Witten, Moffat and Bell [825]. They also present implementations of text compression methods, such as Huffman and arithmetic coding, as part of a fully operational retrieval system written in ANSI 190        TEXT OPERATIONS C. Bell, Cleary and Witten [78] cover statistical and dictionary methods, laying particular stress on adaptive methods as well as theoretical aspects of compression, with estimates on the entropy of several natural languages. Storer [747] covers the main compression techniques, with emphasis on dictionary methods. Huffman coding was originally presented in [386]. Adaptive versions of Huffman coding appear in [291, 446, 789]. Word-based compression is considered in [81, 571, 377, 77]. Bounds on the inefficiency of Huffman coding have been presented by [291]. Canonical codes were first presented in [713]. Many properties of the canonical codes are mentioned in [374]. Byte Huffman coding was proposed in [577]. Sequential searching on byte Huffman compressed text is described in [577, 576]. Sequential searching on Ziv-Lempel compressed data is presented in [250, 19]. More recently, implementations of sequential searching on Ziv-Lempel compressed text are presented in [593]. One of the first papers on arithmetic coding is in [675]. Other references are [823, 78]. A variety of compression methods for inverted lists are studied in [573]. The most effective compression methods for inverted lists are based on the sequence of gaps between document numbers, as considered in [77] and in [572]. Their results are based on run-length encodings proposed by Elias [235] and Golomb [307]. A comprehensive study of inverted file compression can be found in [825]. More recently Vo and Moffat [790] have presented algorithms to process the index with no need to fully decode the compressed index.
mir-0135	8.1     Introduction Chapter 4 describes the query operations that can be performed on text databases. In this chapter we cover the main techniques we need to implement those query operations. We first concentrate on searching queries composed of words and on reporting the documents where they are found. The number of occurrences of a query in each document and even its exact positions in the text may also be required. Following that, we concentrate on algorithms dealing with Boolean operations. We then consider sequential search algorithms and pattern matching. Finally, we consider structured text and compression techniques. An obvious option in searching for a basic query is to scan the text sequentially. Sequential or online text searching involves finding the occurrences of a pattern in a text when the text is not preprocessed. Online searching is appropriate when the text is small (i.e., a few megabytes), and it is the only choice if the text collection is very volatile (i.e., undergoes modifications very frequently) or the index space overhead cannot be afforded. A second option is to build data structures over the text (called indices) to speed up the search. It is worthwhile building and maintaining an index when the text collection is large and semi-static. Semi-static collections can be updated at reasonably regular intervals (e.g., daily) but they are not deemed to support thousands of insertions of single words per second, say. This is the case for most real text databases, not only dictionaries or other slow growing literary works. For instance, it is the case for Web search engines or journal archives. Nowadays, the most successful techniques for medium size databases (say up to 200Mb) combine online and indexed searching. We cover three main indexing techniques: inverted files, suffix arrays, and signature files. Keyword-based search is discussed first. We emphasize inverted files, which are currently the best choice for most applications.    Suffix trees 191 192        INDEXING AND SEARCHING and arrays are faster for phrase searches and other less common queries, but are harder to build and maintain. Finally, signature files were popular in the 1980s, but nowadays inverted files outperform them. For all the structures we pay attention not only to their search cost and space overhead, but also to the cost of building and updating them. We assume that the reader is familiar with basic data structures, such as sorted arrays, binary search trees, B-trees, hash tables, and tries. Since tries are heavily used we give a brief and simplified reminder here. Tries, or digital search trees, are multiway trees that store sets of strings and are able to retrieve any string in time proportional to its length (independent of the number of strings stored). A special character is added to the end of the string to ensure that no string is a prefix of another. Every edge of the tree is labeled with a letter. To search a string in a trie, one starts at the root and scans the string character-wise, descending by the appropriate edge of the trie. This continues until a leaf is found (which represents the searched string) or the appropriate edge to follow does not exist at some point (i.e., the string is not in the set). See Figure 8.3 for an example of a text and a trie built on its words. Although an index must be built prior to searching it, we present these tasks in the reverse order. We think that understanding first how a data structure is used makes it clear how it is organized, and therefore eases the understanding of the construction algorithm, which is usually more complex. Throughout this chapter we make the following assumptions. We call n the size of the text database. Whenever a pattern is searched, we assume that it is of length m, which is much smaller than n. We call M the amount of main memory available. We assume that the modifications which a text database undergoes are additions, deletions, and replacements (which are normally made by a deletion plus an addition) of pieces of text of size n1 lt; n. We give experimental measures for many algorithms to give the reader a grasp of the real times involved. To do this we use a reference architecture throughout the chapter, which is representative of the power of today's computers. We use a 32-bit Sun UltraSparc-1 of 167 MHz with 64 Mb of RAM, running Solaris. The code is written in C and compiled with all optimization options. For the text data, we use collections from TREC-2, specifically WSJ, DOE, FR, ZIFF and AP. These are described in more detail in Chapter 3.
mir-0136	8.2    Inverted Files An inverted file (or inverted index) is a word-oriented mechanism for indexing a text collection in order to speed up the searching task. The inverted file structure is composed of two elements: the vocabulary and the occurrences. The vocabulary is the set of all different words in the text. For each such word a list of all the text positions where the word appears is stored. The set of all those lists is called the 'occurrences1 (Figure 8.1 shows an example). These positions can refer to words or characters. Word positions (i.e., position i refers to the i-th word) simplify 1	6	9	11	17	19	24	28	33	40	46	INVERTED 50          55	FILES         J 60 This	is	a	text.	A	text	has	many	words.

The occurrences point to character positions in the text. phrase and proximity queries, while character positions (i.e., the position i is the z-th character) facilitate direct access to the matching text positions. Some authors make the distinction between inverted files and inverted lists. In an inverted file, each element of a list points to a document or file name, while inverted lists match our definition. We prefer not to make such a distinction because, as we will see later, this is a matter of the addressing granularity, which can range from text positions to logical blocks. The space required for the vocabulary is rather small. According to Heaps' law (see Chapter 6) the vocabulary grows as O(n^), where (3 is a constant between 0 and 1 dependent on the text, being between 0.4 and 0.6 in practice. For instance, for 1 Gb of the TREC-2 collection the vocabulary has a size of only 5 Mb. This may be further reduced by stemming and other normalization techniques as described in Chapter 7. The occurrences demand much more space. Since each word appearing in the text is referenced once in that structure, the extra space is O(n). Even omitting stopwords (which is the default practice when words are indexed), in practice the space overhead of the occurrences is between 30% and 40% of the text size. To reduce space requirements, a technique called block addressing is used. The text is divided in blocks, and the occurrences point to the blocks where the word appears (instead of the exact positions). The classical indices which point to the exact occurrences are called 'full inverted indices/ By using block addressing not only can the pointers be smaller because there are fewer blocks than positions, but also all the occurrences of a word inside a single block are collapsed to one reference (see Figure 8.2). Indices of only 5% overhead over the text size are obtained with this technique. The price to pay is that, if the exact occurrence positions are required (for instance, for a proximity query), then an online search over the qualifying blocks has to be performed. For instance, block addressing indices with 256 blocks stop working well with texts of 200 Mb. Table-1 8.1 presents the projected space taken by inverted indices for texts of 194        INDEXING AND SEARCHING Block 1                                Block 2                                Block 3 Block 4 This is a text. A text has many words.  Words are made from letters Vocabulary Text Inverted Index Figure 8.2 The sample text split into four blocks, and an inverted index using block addressing built on it. The occurrences denote block numbers. Notice that both occurrences of 'words1 collapsed into one. different sizes, with and without the use of stopwords. The full inversion stands for inverting all the words and storing their exact positions, using four bytes per pointer. The document addressing index assumes that we point to documents which are of size 10 Kb (and the necessary number of bytes per pointer, i.e. one, two, and three bytes, depending on text size). The block addressing index assumes that we use 256 or 64K blocks (one or two bytes per pointer) independently of the text size. The space taken by the pointers can be significantly reduced by using compression. We assume that 45% of all the words are stop-words, and that there is one non-stopword each 11.5 characters. Our estimation for the vocabulary is based on Heaps' lawT with parameters V = 30?20-5. All these decisions were taken according to our experience and experimentally validated. The blocks can be of fixed size (imposing a logical block structure over the text database) or they can be defined using the natural division of the text collection into files, documents. Web pages, or others. The division into blocks of fixed size improves efficiency at retrieval time, i.e. the more variance in the block sizes, the more amount of text sequentially traversed on average. This is because larger blocks match queries more frequently and are more expensive to traverse. Alternatively, the division using natural cuts may eliminate the need for online traversal. For example, if one block per retrieval unit is used and the exact match positions are not required, there is no need to traverse the text for single-word queries, since it is enough to know which retrieval units to report. But if, on the other hand, many retrieval units are packed into a single block, the block has to be traversed to determine which units to retrieve. It is important to notice that in order to use block addressing, the text must be readily available at search time. This is not the case for remote text (as in Web search engines), or if the text is in a CD-ROM that has to be mounted, for instance. Some restricted queries not needing exact positions can still be solved if the blocks are retrieval units.

Four granularities and three collections are considered. For each collection, the right column considers that stopwords are not indexed while the left column considers that all words are indexed.
mir-0137	8.2.1    Searching The search algorithm on an inverted index follows three general steps (some may be absent for specific queries): ï  Vocabulary search The words and patterns present in the query are isolated and searched in the vocabulary. Notice that phrases and proximity queries are split into single words. ï  Retrieval of occurrences The lists of the occurrences of all the words found are retrieved. ï  Manipulation of occurrences The occurrences are processed to solve phrases, proximity, or Boolean operations.   If block addressing is used it may be necessary to directly search the text to find the information missing from the occurrences (e.g., exact word positions to form phrases). Hence, searching on an inverted index always starts in the vocabulary. Because of this it is a good idea to have it in a separate file. It is possible that this file fits in main memory even for large text collections. Single-word queries can be searched using any suitable data structure to speed up the search, such as hashing, tries, or B-trees. The first two give O(m) search cost (independent of the text size). However, simply storing the words in lexicographical order is cheaper in space and very competitive in performance, since the word can be binary searched at O(logn) cost. Prefix and range queries can also be solved with binary search, tries, or B-trees, but not with hashing. If the query is formed by single words, then the process ends by delivering the list of occurrences (we may need to make a union of many lists if the pattern mat dies many words). 196        INDEXING AND SEARCHING Context queries are more difficult to solve with inverted indices. Each element must be searched separately and a list (in increasing positional order) generated for each one. Then, the lists of all elements are traversed in synchronization to find places where all the words appear in sequence (for a phrase) or appear close enough (for proximity). If one list is much shorter than the others, it may be better to binary search its elements into the longer lists instead of performing a linear merge. It is possible to prove using Zipf s law that this is normally the case. This is important because the most time-demanding operation on inverted indices is the merging or intersection of the lists of occurrences. If the index stores character positions the phrase query cannot allow the separators to be disregarded, and the proximity has to be defined in terms of character distance. Finally, note that if block addressing is used it is necessary to traverse the blocks for these queries, since the position information is needed. It is then better to intersect the lists to obtain the blocks which contain all the searched words and then sequentially search the context query in those blocks as explained in section 8.5. Some care has to be exercised at block boundaries, since they can split a match. This part of the search, if present, is also quite time consuming. Using Heaps1 and the generalized Zipf s laws, it has been demonstrated that the cost of solving queries is sublinear in the text size, even for complex queries involving list merging. The time complexity is 0(na), where a depends on the query and is close to 0.4..0.8 for queries with reasonable selectivity. Even if block addressing is used and the blocks have to be traversed, it is possible to select the block size as an increasing function of n, so that not only does the space requirement keep sublinear but also the amount of text traversed in all useful queries is also sublinear. Practical figures show, for instance, that both the space requirement and the amount of text traversed can be close to O(n0"85). Hence, inverted indices allow us to have sublinear search time at sublinear space requirements. This is not possible on the other indices. Search times on our reference machine for a full inverted index built on 250 Mb of text give the following results: searching a simple word took 0.08 seconds, while searching a phrase took 0.25 to 0.35 seconds (from two to five words).
mir-0138	8.2.2    Construction Building and maintaining an inverted index is a relatively low cost task. In principle, an inverted index on a text of n characters can be built in O(n) time. All the vocabulary known up to now is kept in a trie data structure, storing for each word a list of its occurrences (text positions). Each word of the text is read and searched in the trie. If it is not found, it is added to the trie with an empty list of occurrences. Once it is in the trie, the new position is added to the end of its list of occurrences. Figure 8.3 illustrates this process. Once the text is exhausted, the trie is written to disk together with tiie list of occurrence.  It is good practice to split the index into two files.  In the INVERTED FILES         197 1            6       9    11               17 19          24       28          33                  40            46         50          55           60 This   is   a  text.     A  text   has  many   words.     Words   are  made    from   letters. Text Vocabulary trie Figure 8.3    Building an inverted index for the sample text. first file, the lists of occurrences are stored contiguously. In this scheme, the file is typically called a 'posting file'. In the second file, the vocabulary is stored in lexicographical order and, for each word, a pointer to its list in the first file is also included. This allows the vocabulary to be kept in memory at search time in many cases. Further, the number of occurrences of a word can be immediately known from the vocabulary with little or no space overhead. We analyze now the construction time under this scheme. Since in the trie 0(1) operations are performed per text character, and the positions can be inserted at the end of the lists of occurrences in 0(1) time, the overall process is O(n) worst-case time. However, the above algorithm is not practical for large texts where the index does not fit in main memory. A paging mechanism will severely degrade the performance of the algorithm. We describe an alternative which is faster in practice. The algorithm already described is used until the main memory is exhausted (if the trie takes up too much space it can be replaced by a hash table or other structure). When no more memory is available, the partial index J2 obtained up to now is written to disk and erased from main memory before continuing with the rest of the text. Finally, a number of partial indices Iz exist on disk. These indices are then merged in a hierarchical fashion. Indices I\ and I2 are merged to obtain the index J1..2; /.3 and I4 produce i"3..4; and so on. The resulting partial indices are now approximately twice the size. When all the indices at this level have been merged in this way, the merging proceeds at the next level, joining the index I\ ,2 with the index J3..4 to form /1..4. This is continued until there is just one index comprising the whole text, as illustrated in Figure 8.4. Merging two indices consists of merging the sorted vocabularies, and whenever the same word appears in both indices, merging both lists of occurrences. By construction, the occurrences of the smaller-numbered index are before those of the larger-numbered index, and therefore the lists are just concatenated. This is a very fast process in practice, and its complexity is O(n\ +n2K where ii\ and fi-gt; are the sizes of the indices. 198        INDEXING AND SEARCHING I-1..8 Level 4 (final index) I-1..4		I-5..8 Level 3 Level 2 Level 1 (initial dumps) Figure 8.4 Merging the partial indices in a binary fashion. Rectangles represent partial Indices, while rounded rectangles represent merging operations. The numbers inside the merging operations show a possible merging order. The total time to generate the partial indices is O(n) as before. The number of partial indices is O(n/M). Each level of merging performs a linear process over the whole index (no matter how it is split into partial indices at this level) and thus its cost is O(n). To merge the 0{n/M) partial indices, Iog2(n/A/) merging levels are necessary, and therefore the cost of this algorithm is O(nlog(n/M)). More than two indices can be merged at once. Although this does not change the complexity, it improves efficiency since fewer merging levels exist. On the other hand, the memory buffers for each partial index to merge will be smaller and hence more disk seeks will be performed. In practice it is a good idea to merge even 20 partial indices at once. Real times to build inverted indices on the reference machine are between 4-8 Mb/min for collections of up to 1 Gb (the slowdown factor as the text grows is barely noticeable). Of this time, 20-30% is spent on merging the partial indices. To reduce build-time space requirements, it is possible to perform the merging in-place. That is, when two or more indices are merged, write the result in the same disk blocks of the original indices instead of on a new file. It is also a good idea to perform the hierarchical merging as soon as the files are generated (e.g.. collapse /) and /2 into J1gt;gt;2 as soon as I2 is produced). This also reduces space requirements because the vocabularies are merged and redundant words are eliminated (there is no redundancy in the occurrences). The vocabulary can be a significative part of the smaller partial indices, since they represent a small text. This algorithm changes very little if block addressing is used. Index maintenance is also cheap. Assume that a new text of size n* is added to the database, Tlip inverted index for the new text is built and then both indices are merged OTHER INDICES FOR TEXT         199 as is done for partial indices. This takes O(n -f n' log(n'JM)). Deleting text can be done by an O(n) pass over the index eliminating the occurrences that point inside eliminated text areas (and eliminating words if their lists of occurrences disappear in the process).
mir-0140	8.3.1    Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays Inverted indices assume that the text can be seen as a sequence of words. This restricts somewhat the kinds of queries that can be answered. Other queries such as phrases are expensive to solve. Moreover, the concept of word does not exist in some applications such as genetic databases. In this section we present suffix arrays. Suffix arrays are a space efficient implementation of suffix trees. This type of index allows us to answer efficiently more complex queries. Its main drawbacks are its costly construction process, that the text must be readily available at query time, and that the results are not delivered in text position order. This structure can be used to index only words (without stopwords) as the inverted index as well as to index any text character. This makes it suitable for a wider spectrum of applications, such as genetic databases. However, for word-based applications, inverted files perform better unless complex queries are an important issue. This index sees the text as one long string. Each position in the text is considered as a text suffix (i.e., a string that goes from that text position to the end of the text). It is not difficult to see that two suffixes starting at different positions are lexicographically different (assume that a character smaller than all the rest is placed at the end of the text). Each suffix is thus uniquely identified by its position. Not all text positions need to be indexed. Index points are selected from the text, which point to the beginning of the text positions which will be retrievable. For instance, it is possible to index only word beginnings to have a functionality similar to inverted indices. Those elements which are not index points are not retrievable (as in an inverted index it is not possible to retrieve the middle of a word). Figure 8.5 illustrates this. Structure In essence, a suffix tree is a trie data structure built over all the suffixes of the text. The pointers to the suffixes are stored at the leaf nodes. To improve space utilization, this trie is compacted into a Patricia tree. This involves compressing unary paths, i.e. paths where each node has just one child. An indication of the next character position to consider is stored at the nodes which root a compressed path. Once unary paths are not present the tree has O(n) nodes instead of the worst-case O(n2) of the trie (see Figure 8.6). 200        INDEXING AND SEARCHING This is a text. A text has many words.

Suffix Trie Suffix Tree Text Figure 8.6    The suffix trie and suffix tree for the sample text. The problem with this structure is its space. Depending on the implementation, each node of the trie takes 12 to 24 bytes, and therefore even if only word beginnings are indexed, a space overhead of 120% to 240% over the text size is produced. Suffix arrays provide essentially the same functionality as suffix trees with much less space requirements. If the leaves of the suffix tree are traversed in left-to-right order (top to bottom in our figures), all the suffixes of the text are retrieved in lexicographical order. A suffix array is simply an array containing all the pointers to the text suffixes listed in lexicographical order, as shown in Figure 8,7. Since they store one pointer per indexed suffix, the space requirements OTHER INDICES FOR TEXT        201 1	6	9	11	17	19	24	28	33	40	46	50	55	60 This	is	a	text.	A	text	has	many	words.

One out of three entries are sampled, keeping their first four characters. The pointers (arrows) are in fact unnecessary. are almost the same as those for inverted indices (disregarding compression techniques), i.e. close to 40% overhead over the text size. Suffix arrays are designed to allow binary searches done by comparing the contents of each pointer. If the suffix array is large (the usual case), this binary search can perform poorly because of the number of random disk accesses. To remedy this situation, the use of supra-indices over the suffix array has been proposed. The simplest supra-index is no more than a sampling of one out of b suffix array entries, where for each sample the first £ suffix characters are stored in the supra-index. This supra-index is then used as a first step of the search to reduce external accesses. Figure 8.8 shows an example. This supra-index does not in fact need to take samples at fixed intervals, nor to take samples of the same length. For word-indexing suffix arrays it has been suggested that a new sample could be taken each time the first word of the suffix changes, and to store the word instead of I characters. This is exactly the same as having a vocabulary of the text plus pointers to the array. In fact, the only important difference between this structure and an inverted index is that the occurrences of each word in an inverted index are sorted by text position, while in a suffix array they are sorted lexicographically by the text following the word. Figure 8.9 illustrates this relationship. The extra space requirements of supra-indices are modest. In particular, it is clear that the space requirements of the suffix array with a vocabulary supra-index are exactly the same as for inverted indices (except for compression, as we see later). 202       INDEXING AND SEARCHING 1	6	9	11	17	19	24	28	33	40	46	50	55	60 This	is	a	text.

Searching If a suffix tree on the text can be afforded, many basic patterns such as words, prefixes, and phrases can be searched in O(m) time by a simple trie search. However, suffix trees are not practical for large texts, as explained. Suffix arrays, on the other hand, can perform the same search operations in O(logn) time by doing a binary search instead of a trie search. This is achieved as follows: the search pattern originates two 'limiting patterns5 Pi and P2, so that we want any suffix S such that Pi lt; S lt; iV We binary search both limiting patterns in the suffix array. Then, all the elements lying between both positions point to exactly those suffixes that start like the original pattern (i.e., to the pattern positions in the text). For instance, in our example of figure 8.9, in order to find the word 'text1 we search, for 'text' and ktexu\ obtaining the portion of the array that contains the pointers 19 and 11. Ail these queries retrieve a subtree of the suffix tree or an interval of the suffix array. The results have to be collected later, which may imply sorting them in ascending text order. This is a complication of suffix trees or arrays with respect to inverted indices. Simple phrase searching is a good case for these indices. A simple phrase of words can be searched as if it was a simple pattern. This is because the suffix tree/array sorts with respect to the complete suffixes and not only their first word. A proximity search, on the other hand, has to be solved element-wise. The matches for each element must be collected and sorted and then they have to be intersected as for inverted files. The binary search performed on suffix arrays, unfortunately, is done on disk, where the accesses to (random) text positions force a seek operation which spans the disk tracks containing the text. Since a random seek is O(n) in'size, this makes the search cost O(n logn) time. Supra-indices are used as a first step in any binary search operation to alleviate this problem. To avoid performing O(log n) random accesses to the ivxt on disk (and to the suffix array on disk), the search starts in the supra-index, which usually fits in main memory (text samples OTHER INDICES FOR TEXT        203 included). After this search is completed, the suffix array block which is between the two selected samples is brought into memory and the binary search is completed (performing random accesses to the text on disk). This reduces disk search times to close to 25% of the original time. Modified binary search techniques that sacrifice the exact partition in the middle of the array taking into account the current disk head position allow a further reduction from 40% to 60%. Search times in a 250 Mb text in our reference machine are close to 1 second for a simple word or phrase, while the part corresponding to the accesses to the text sums up 0.6 seconds. The use of supra-indices should put the total time close to 0.3 seconds. Note that the times, although high for simple words, do not degrade for long phrases as with inverted indices. Construction in Main Memory A suffix tree for a text of n characters can be built in O(n) time. The algorithm, however, performs poorly if the suffix tree does not fit in main memory, which is especially stringent because of the large space requirements of the suffix trees. We do not cover the linear algorithm here because it is quite complex and only of theoretical interest. We concentrate on direct suffix array construction. Since the suffix array is no more than the set of pointers lexicographically sorted, the pointers are collected in ascending text order and then just sorted by the text they point to. Note that in order to compare two suffix array entries the corresponding text positions must be accessed. These accesses are basically random. Hence, both the suffix array and the text must be in main memory. This algorithm costs O(n log n) string comparisons. An algorithm to build the suffix array in O(nlogn) character comparisons follows. All the suffixes are bucket-sorted in O(n) time according to the first letter only. Then, each bucket is bucket-sorted again, now according to their first two letters. At iteration i, the suffixes begin already sorted by their 22""1 first letters and end up sorted by their first 2% letters. As at each iteration the total cost of all the bucket sorts is O(n), the total time is O(nlogn), and the average is O(n log log n) (since O(logn) comparisons are necessary on average to distinguish two suffixes of a text). This algorithm accesses the text only in the first stage (bucket sort for the first letter). In order to sort the strings in the i-th iteration, notice that since all suffixes are sorted by their first 2i~"1 letters, to sort the text positions To... and IL, in the suffix array (assuming that they are in the same bucket, i.e., they share their first 2i~1 letters), it is enough to determine the relative order between text positions Ta+2*~i and T^*-1 m the current stage of the search. This can be done in constant time by storing the reverse permutation. We do not enter here into further detail. Construction of Suffix Arrays for Large Texts There is still the problem that large text databases will not fit in main memory. It could be possible to apply an external memory sorting algorithm. However, 204        INDEXING AND SEARCHING each comparison involves accessing the text at random positions on the disk. This will severely degrade the performance of the sorting process. We explain an algorithm especially designed for large texts. Split the text into blocks that can be sorted in main memory. Then, for each block, build its suffix array in main memory and merge it with the rest of the array already built for the previous text. That is: ï  build the suffix array for the first block, ï  build the suffix array for the second block, ï  merge both suffix arrays, ï  build the suffix array for the third block, ï  merge the new suffix array with the previous one, ï  build the suffix array for the fourth block, ï  merge the new suffix array with the previous one, ï  ... and so on. The difficult part is how to merge a large suffix array (already built) with the small suffix array (just built). The merge needs to compare text positions which are spread in a large text, so the problem persists. The solution is to first determine how many elements of the large array are to be placed between each pair of elements in the small array, and later use that information to merge the arrays without accessing the text. Hence, the information that we need is how many suffixes of the large text lie between each pair of positions of the small suffix array. We compute counters that store this information. The counters are computed without using the large suffix array. The text corresponding to the large array is sequentially read into main memory. Each suffix of that text is searched in the small suffix array (in main memory). Once we find the inter-element position where the suffix lies, we just increment the appropriate counter. Figure 8.10 illustrates this process. We analyze this algorithm now. If there is O(M) main memory to index, then there will be O(nfAl) text blocks. Each block is merged against an array of size O(n), where all the O(n) suffixes of the large text are binary searched in the small suffix array. This gives a total CPU complexity of O(n2 log(M)/M). Notice that this same algorithm can be used for index maintenance. If a new text of size n' is added to the database, it can be split into blocks as before and merged block-wise into the current suffix array. This will take O(nn'\og{M)/M). To delete some text it suffices to perform an O(n) pass over the array eliminating all the text positions which lie in the deleted areas. As can be seen, the construction process is in practice more costly for suffix arrays than for inverted files. The construction of the supra-index consists of a fast final sequential pass over the suffix array. Indexing times for 250 Mb of text are close to 0.8 Mb/niin on the reference machine.

mir-0141	8.3.2    Signature Files Signature files are word-oriented index structures based on hashing. They pose a low overhead (10% to 20% over the text size), at the cost of forcing a sequential search over the index. However, although their search complexity is linear (instead of sublinear as with the previous approaches), its constant is rather low, which makes the technique suitable for not very large texts. Nevertheless, inverted files outperform signature files for most applications. Structure A signature file uses a hash function (or 'signature') that maps words to bit masks of B bits. It divides the text in blocks of b words each. To each text block of size 6, a bit mask of size B will be assigned. This mask is obtained by bitwise ORing the signatures of all the words in the text block. Hence, the signature file is no more than the sequence of bit masks of all blocks (plus a pointer to each block). The main idea is that if a word is present in a text block, then all the bits set in its signature are also set in the bit mask of the text block. Hence, whenever a bit is set in the mask of the query word and not in the mask of the text block, then the word is not present in the text block. Figure 8.11 shows an example. However, it is possible that all the corresponding bits are set even though the word is not there. This is called a false drop. The most delicate part of the design of a signature file is to ensure that the probability of a false drop is low enough while keeping the signature file as short as possible. The hash function is forced to deliver bit masks which have at least £ bits set. A good model assumes that £ bits are randomly set in the mask (with passible repetition).   Let a = £/B.   Since each of the b words sets £ bits at 206        INDEXING AND SEARCHING Block 1                         Block 2                         Block 3 Block 4 This is a text. A text has many words.  Words are made from letters. 000101		110101		100100		101101 Text Text signature h(text) = 000101 h(many) =110000 h( words) = 100100 h(made) =001100 h(letters) = 100001 Signature function Figure 8.11    A signature file for our sample text cut into blocks. random, the probability that a given bit of the mask is set in a word signature is 1 - (1 - l/B)M ´ 1 - e~ba. Hence, the probability that the £ random bits set in the query are also set in the mask of the text block is which is minimized for a = ln(2)/6. The false drop probability under the optimal selection £ = Bln(2)/b is (i/2ln´2))5/6 = 1/2*. Hence, a reasonable proportion B/b must be determined. The space overhead of the index is approximately (1/80) x (B/b) because B is measured in bits and b in words. Then, the false drop probability is a function of the overhead to pay. For instance, a 10% overhead implies a false drop probability close to 2%, while a 20% overhead errs with probability 0.046%. This error probability corresponds to the expected amount of sequential searching to perform while checking if a match is a false drop or not. Searching Searching a single word is carried out by hashing it to a bit mask W, and then comparing the bit masks B% of all the text blocks. Whenever (W  B{ = W), where  is the bitwise AND, all the bits set in W are also set in B% and therefore the text block may contain the word. Hence, for all candidate text blocks, an online traversal must be performed to verify if the word is actually there. This traversal cannot be avoided as in inverted files (except if the risk of a false drop is accepted). No other types of patterns can be searched in this scheme. On the other hand, the scheme is more efficient to search phrases and reasonable proximity queries. This is because all the words must be present in a block in order for that block to hold the phrase or the proximity query. Hence, the bitwise OR of all the query masks is searched, so that all their bits must be present. This BOOLEAN QUERIES        207 reduces the probability of false drops. This is the only indexing scheme which improves in phrase searching. Some care has to be exercised at block boundaries, however, to avoid missing a phrase which crosses a block limit. To allow searching phrases of j words or proximities of up to j words, consecutive blocks must overlap in j words. If the blocks correspond to retrieval units, simple Boolean conjunctions involving words or phrases can also be improved by forcing all the relevant words to be in the block. We were only able to find real performance estimates from 1992, run on a Sun 3/50 with local disk. Queries on a small 2.8 Mb database took 0.42 seconds. Extrapolating to today's technology, we find that the performance should be close to 20 Mb/sec (recall that it is linear time), and hence the example of 250 Mb of text would take 12 seconds, which is quite slow. Construction The construction of a signature file is rather easy. The text is simply cut in blocks, and for each block an entry of the signature file is generated. This entry is the bitwise OR of the signatures of all the words in the block. Adding text is also easy, since it is only necessary to keep adding records to the signature file. Text deletion is carried out by deleting the appropriate bit masks. Other storage proposals exist apart from storing all the bit masks in sequence. For instance, it is possible to make a different file for each bit of the mask, i.e. one file holding all the first bits, another file for all the second bits, etc. This reduces the disk times to search for a query, since only the files corresponding to the £ bits which are set in the query have to be traversed.
mir-0142	8.4    Boolean Queries We now cover set manipulation algorithms.   These algorithms are used when operating on sets of results, which is the case in Boolean queries. Boolean queries are described in Chapter 4, where the concept of query syntax tree is defined. Once the leaves of the query syntax tree are solved (using the algorithms to find the documents containing the basic queries given), the relevant documents must be worked on by composition operators. Normally the search proceeds in three phases: the first phase determines which documents classify, the second determines the relevance of the classifying documents so as to present them appropriately to the user, and the final phase retrieves the exact positions of the matches to highlight them in those documents that the user actually wants to see. This scheme avoids doing unnecessary work on documents which will not classify at last (first phase), or will not be read at last (second phase). However, some phases can be merged if doing the extra operations is not expensive. Some phases may not be present at all in some scenarios. 208        INDEXING AND SEARCHING AND                                                        AND lt;ªgt;     /    \           /    \ 146        OR                       146      23467 (b) AND 246       237 OR 2   4         OR 2   4         OR 3   4         OR 4 3       4                     3       4                     7       6 Figure 8.12   Processing the internal nodes of the query syntax tree.    In (a) full evaluation is used. In (b) we show lazy evaluation in more detailOnce the leaves of the query syntax tree find the classifying sets of documents, these sets are further operated by the internal nodes of the tree. It is possible to algebraically optimize the tree using identities such as a OR (a AND b) = a, for instance, or sharing common subexpressions, but we do not cover this issue here. As all operations need to pair the same document in both their operands, it is good practice to keep the sets sorted, so that operations like intersection, union, etc. can proceed sequentially on both lists and also generate a sorted list. Other representations for sets not consisting of the list of matching documents (such as bit vectors) are also possible. Under this scheme, it is possible to evaluate the syntax tree in full or lazy form. In the full evaluation form, both operands are first completely obtained and then the complete result is generated. In lazy evaluation, results are delivered only when required, and to obtain that result some data is recursively required to both operands. Full evaluation allows some optimizations to be performed because the sizes of the results are known in advance (for instance, merging a very short list against a very long one can proceed by binary searching the elements of the short list in the long one). Lazy evaluation, on the other hand, allows the application to control when to do the work of obtaining new results, instead of blocking it for a long time. Hybrid schemes are possible, for example obtain all the leaves at once and then proceed in lazy form. This may be useful, for instance, to implement some optimizations or to ensure that all the accesses to the index are sequential (thus reducing disk seek times). Figure 8.12 illustrates this. The complexity of solving these types of queries, apart from the cost of obtaining the results at the leaves, is normally linear in the total size of all the intermediate results. This is why this time may dominate the others, when there are huge intermediate results. This is more noticeable to the user when the final result is small.

mir-0143	8.5    Sequential Searching We now cover the algorithms for text searching when no data structure has been built on the text. As shown, this is a basic part of some indexing techniques as well as the only option in some cases. We cover exact string matching in this section. Later we cover matching of more complex patterns. Our exposition is mainly conceptual and the implementation details are not shown (see the Bibliographic Discussion at the end of this chapter for more information). The problem of exact string matching is: given a short pattern P of length m and a long text T of length n, find all the text positions where the pattern occurs. With minimal changes this problem subsumes many basic queries, such as word, prefix, suffix, and substring search. This is a classical problem for which a wealth of solutions exists. We sketch the main algorithms, and leave aside a lot of the theoretical work that is not competitive in practice. For example, we do not include the Karp-Rabin algorithm, which is a nice application of hashing to string searching, but is not practical. We also briefly cover multipattern algorithms (that search many patterns at once), since a query may have many patterns and it may be more efficient to retrieve them all at once. Finally, we also mention how to do phrases and proximity searches. We assume that the text and the pattern are sequences of characters drawn from an alphabet of size lt;r, whose first character is at position 1. The average-case analysis assumes random text and patterns.
mir-0144	8.5.1    Brute Force The brute-force (BF) algorithm is the simplest possible one. It consists of merely trying all possible pattern positions in the text. For each such position, it verifies whether the pattern matches at that position. See Figure 8.13. Since there are O(n) text positions and each one is examined at O(m) worst-case cost, the worst-case of brute-force searching is 0(mn). However, its average 210        INDEXING AND SEARCHING case is O(n) (since on random text a mismatch is found after (9(1) comparisons on average). This algorithm does not need any pattern preprocessing. Many algorithms use a modification of this scheme. There is a window of length m which is slid over the text. It is checked whether the text in the window is equal to the pattern (if it is, the window position is reported as a match). Then, the window is shifted forward. The algorithms mainly differ in the way they check and shift the window.
mir-0145	8.5.2    Knuth-Morris-Pratt The KMP algorithm was the first with linear worst-case behavior, although on average it is not much faster than BF. This algorithm also slides a window over the text, However, it does not try all window positions as BF does. Instead, it reuses information from previous checks. After the window is checked, whether it matched the pattern or not, a number of pattern letters were compared to the text window, and they all matched except possibly the last one compared. Hence, when the window has to be shifted, there is a prefix of the pattern that matched the text. The algorithm takes advantage of this information to avoid trying window positions which can be deduced not to match. The pattern is preprocessed in O(m) time and space to build a table called next The next table at position j says which is the longest proper prefix of Pi..j-i which is also a suffix and the characters following prefix and suffix are different. Hence j ó next[j] ¶+1 window positions can be safely skipped if the characters up to j ó 1 matched, and the j-th did not. For instance, when searching the word 'abracadabra/ if a text window matched up to 'abracab,' five positions can be safely skipped since next[7] = 1. Figure 8.14 shows an example. The crucial observation is that this information depends only on the pattern, because if the text in the window matched up to position j ó 1, then that text is equal to the pattern. The algorithm moves a window over the text and a pointer inside the window. Each time a character matches, the pointer is advanced (a match is reported if the pointer reaches the end of the window). Each time a character is not matched, the window is shifted forward in the text, to the position given by next but the pointer position in the text does not change. Since at each text comparison the window or the pointer advance by at least one position, the algorithm performs at most 2n comparisons (and at least n). The Aho-Corasick algorithm can be regarded as an extension of KMP in matching a set of patterns. The patterns are arranged in a trie-like data structure. Each trie node represents having matched a prefix of some pattern(s). The next function is replaced by a more general set of failure transitions. Those transitions go between nodes of the trie. A transition leaving from a node representing the prefix x leads to a node representing a prefix t/, such that y is the longest prefix in the set of patterns which is also a proper suffix of x. Figure 8.15 illustrates this.

On the right, a search example. Grayed areas show the prefix information reused. Figure 8.15    Aho-Corasick trie example for the set 'hello,' 'elbow' and 'eleven' showing only one of all the failure transitions. This trie, together with its failure transitions, is built in O(m) time and space (where m is the total length of all the patterns). Its search time is O{n) no matter how many patterns are searched. Much as KMP, it makes at most 2n inspections.
mir-0146	8.5.3    Boyer-Moore Family BM algorithms are based on the fact that the check inside the window can proceed backwards. When a match or mismatch is determined, a suffix of the pattern has been compared and found equal to the text in the window. This can be used in a way very similar to the next table of KMP, i.e. compute for every pattern position j the next-to-last occurrence of Pj..m inside P. This is called the kmatch heuristic/ This is combined with what is called the 'occurrence heuristic' It states that the text character that produced the mismatch (if a mismatch occurred) has to be aligned with the same character in the pattern after the shift. The heuristic which gives the longest shift is selected. For instance, assume that 'abracadabra" is searched in a text which starts with kabracababra/ After matching the suffix kabra" the underlined text character 'b1 will cause a mismatch. The match heuristic states that since "abra" was matched a shift of 7 is safe. The occurrence heuristic states that since the underlined *b* must match the pattern, a shift of 5 is safe. Hence, the pattern is 212        INDEXING AND SEARCHING Figure 8.16 BM algorithm searching 'abracadabra.' Squared areas show the comparisons performed. Grayed areas have already been compared (but the algorithm compares them again). The dashed box shows the match heuristic, which was not chosen. shifted by 7. See Figure 8.16. The preprocessing time and space of this algorithm is O(m + a). Its search time is O(nlog(m)/ra) on average, which is 'sublinear1 in the sense that not all characters are inspected. On the other hand, its worst case is 0{mn) (unlike KMP, the old suffix information is not kept to avoid further comparisons). Further simplifications of the BM algorithm lead to some of the fastest algorithms on average. The Simplified BM algorithm uses only the occurrence heuristic. This obtains almost the same shifts in practice. The BM-Horspool (BMH) algorithm does the same, but it notices that it is not important any more that the check proceeds backwards, and uses the occurrence heuristic on the last character of the window instead of the one that caused the mismatch. This gives longer shifts on average. Finally, the BM-Sunday (BMS) algorithm modifies BMH by using the character following the last one, which improves the shift especially on short patterns. The Commentz-Walter algorithm is an extension of BM to multipattern search. It builds a trie on the reversed patterns, and instead of a backward window check, it enters into the trie with the window characters read backwards. A shift function is computed by a natural extension of BM. In general this algorithm improves over Aho-Corasick for not too many patterns.
mir-0147	8.5.4    Shift-Or Shift-Or is based on hit-parallelism. This technique involves taking advantage of the intrinsic parallelism of the bit operations inside a computer word (of w bits). By cleverly using this fact, the number of operations that an algorithm performs can be cut by a factor of at most w. Since in current architectures w is 32 or 64. the speedup is very significant in practice. The Shift-Or algorithm uses bit-parallelism to simulate the operation of a non-deterministic automaton that searches the pattern in the text (see Figure 3.17). As this automaton is simulated in time O(mn), the Shift-Or algorithm achieves O(ninfir) worst-case time (optimal speedup). The algorithm first builds a table B which for each character stores a bit mask hm...bi.  The mask in B[c] has the i-th bit set to zero if and only if SEQUENTIAL		SEARCHING			213 gt;x	-N        C      ï-	gt;M	--n   d   /ó				a óªï	© B[a} =	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1 B[b] =	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0 SW =	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0 B[c] =	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0 B[d] =	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0 B\*] =	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0 Figure 8.17 Non-deterministic automaton that searches 'abracadabra,1 and the associated B table. The initial self-loop matches any character. Each table column corresponds to an edge of the automaton. pi = c (see Figure 8.17). The state of the search is kept in a machine word D = dm...di, where d{ is zero whenever the state numbered i in Figure 8.17 is active. Therefore, a match is reported whenever dm is zero. In the following, we use to denote the bitwise OR and c' to denote the bitwise AND. D is set to all ones originally, and for each new text character T3, D is updated using the formula D'   lt;-    (£gt;´ 1)   |   B[Tj] (where 'lt;lt;' means shifting all the bits in D one position to the left and setting the rightmost bit to zero). It is not hard to relate the formula to the movement that occurs in the non-deterministic automaton for each new text character. For patterns longer than the computer word (i.e., m gt; ir), the algorithm uses \m/w'] computer words for the simulation (not all them are active all the time). The algorithm is O(n) on average and the preprocessing is O(m + a) time and O(cr) space. It is easy to extend Shift-Or to handle classes of characters by manipulating the B table and keeping the search algorithm unchanged. This paradigm also can search a large set of extended patterns, as well as multiple patterns (where the complexity is the same as before if we consider that m is the total length of all the patterns).
mir-0148	8.5.5    Suffix Automaton The Backward DAWG matching (BDM) algorithm is based on a suffix automaton. A suffix automaton on a pattern P is an automaton that recognizes all the suffixes of P. The non-deterministic version of this automaton has a very regular structure and is shown in Figure 8.18. The BDlVf algorithm converts this automaton to deterministic. The size and construction time of this automaton is O(m). This is basically the preprocessing effort of the algorithm.

The Xs show the positions where a pattern prefix was recognized. node represents a substring of the pattern.   The final nodes represent pattern suffixes. To search a pattern P, the suffix automaton of Pr (the reversed pattern) is built. The algorithm searches backwards inside the text window for a substring of the pattern P using the suffix automaton. Each time a terminal state is reached before hitting the beginning of the window, the position inside the window is remembered. This corresponds to finding a prefix of the pattern equal to a suffix of the window (since the reverse suffixes of Pr are the prefixes of P). The last prefix recognized backwards is the longest prefix of P in the window. A match is found if the complete window is read, while the check is abandoned when there is no transition to follow in the automaton. In either case, the window is shifted to align with the longest prefix recognized. See Figure 8.19. This algorithm is O(rnn) time in the worst case and 0{n log(m)/m) on average. There exists also a multipattern version of this algorithm called MultiBDM, which is the fastest for many patterns or very long patterns. BDM rarely beats the best BM algorithms. However, a recent bit-parallel implementation called BNDN1 improves over BM in a wide range of cases. This algorithm simulates the non-deterministic suffix automaton using bit-parallelism. The algorithm supports some extended patterns and other applications mentioned in Shift-Or, while keeping more efficient than Shift-Or.
mir-0149	8.5.6    Practical Comparison Figure 8.20 shows a practical comparison between string matching algorithms run on our reference machine. The values are correct within b% of accuracy with a 9f/4 confidence interval. We tested English text from the TREC collection, DNA (corresponding to Ii.iiiflueiizae*) and random text uniformly generated over 64 letters. The patterns were randomly selected from the text except for random PATTERN MATCHING        215 text, where they were randomly generated. We tested over 10 Mb of text and measured CPU time. We tested short patterns on English and random text and long patterns on DNA, which are the typical cases. We first analyze the case of random text, where except for very short patterns the clear winners are BNDM (the bit-parallel implementation of BDM) and the BMS (Sunday) algorithm. The more classical Boyer-Moore and BDM algorithms are also very close. Among the algorithms that do not improve with the pattern length, Shift-Or is the fastest, and KMP is much slower than the naive algorithm. The picture is similar for English text, except that we have included the Agrep software in this comparison, which worked well only on English text. Agrep turns out to be much faster than others. This is not because of using a special algorithm (it uses a BM-family algorithm) but because the code is carefully optimized. This shows the importance of careful coding as well as using good algorithms, especially in text searching where a few operations per text character are performed. Longer patterns are shown for a DNA text. BNDM is the fastest for moderate patterns, but since it does not improve with the length after m gt; w, the classical BDM finally obtains better times. They are much better than the Boyer-Moore family because the alphabet is small and the suffix automaton technique makes better use of the information on the pattern. We have not shown the case of extended patterns, that is, where flexibility plays a role. For this case, BNDM is normally the fastest when it can be applied (e.g., it supports classes of characters but not wild cards), otherwise Shift-Or is the best option. Shift-Or is also the best option when the text must be accessed sequentially and it is not possible to skip characters.
mir-0150	8.5.7    Phrases and Proximity If a sequence of words is searched to appear in the text exactly as in the pattern (i.e., with the same separators) the problem is similar to that of exact search of a single pattern, by just forgetting the fact that there are many words. If any separator between words is to be allowed, it is possible to arrange it using an extended pattern or regular expression search. The best way to search a phrase element-wise is to search for the element which is less frequent or can be searched faster (both criteria normally match). For instance, longer patterns are better than shorter ones; allowing fewer errors is better than allowing more errors. Once such an element is found, the neighboring words are checked to see if a complete match is found. A similar algorithm can be used to search a proximity query.
mir-0151	8.6    Pattern Matching We present in this section the main techniques to deal with complex patterns. We divide it into two main groups: searching allowing errors and searching for extended patterns. 216        INDEXING AND SEARCHING 25 25-, 10   15   20   25   30 Figure 8.20 Practical comparison among algorithms.

Times are in tenths of seconds per megabyte.
mir-0152	8.6.1    String Matching Allowing Errors This problem (called "approximate string matching')   can be stated as follows: given a short pattern P of length m, a long text T of length n, and a maximum allowed number of errors fc, find all the text positions where the pattern occurs with at most k errors. This statement corresponds to the Levenshtein distance. With minimal modifications it is adapted to searching whole wrords matching the pattern with k errors. This problem is newer than exact string matching, although there are already a number of solutions. We sketch the main approaches. Dynamic Programming The classical solution to approximate string matching is based on dynamic programming.   A matrix C[0..m,0..nj is filled column by column, where C[?\jj PATTERN MATCHING         217 represents the minimum number of errors needed to match Pi..$ to a suffix of Ti,,j. This is computed as follows C[0J] = 0 C[t,0] = i C[iJ]    =    if (Pi = Tj) then C[i-lJ~ I] else 1 + min(C[i - lJ],C[i,j - l],C[i - 1,j - 1]) where a match is reported at text positions j such that C[m,j] lt; k (the final positions of the occurrences are reported). Therefore, the algorithm is O(mn) time. Since only the previous column of the matrix is needed, it can be implemented in O(m) space. Its preprocessing time is O(m) . Figure 8.21 illustrates this algorithm. In recent years several algorithms have been presented that achieve O(kn) time in the worst case or even less in the average case, by taking advantage of the properties of the dynamic programming matrix (e.g., values in neighbor cells differ at most by one). Automaton It is interesting to note that the problem can be reduced to a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). Consider the NFA for k = 2 errors shown in Figure 8.22. Each row denotes the number of errors seen. The first one 0, the second one 1, and so on. Every column represents matching the pattern up to a given position. At each iteration, a new text character is read and the automaton changes its states. Horizontal arrows represent matching a character, vertical arrows represent insertions into the pattern, solid diagonal arrows represent replacements, and dashed diagonal arrows represent deletions in the pattern (they are ^-transitions). The automaton accepts a text position as the end of a match s	u	r	g	e	r	y 0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0 s	i	0	1	1	1	1	1	i u	2	1	0	1	2	2	2	2 r	3	2	1	0	1	2	2	3 V	4	3	2	1	1	2	3	3 e	5	4	3	2	2	1	2	3 y	6	5	4	3	3	2	2	2 Figure   8.21    The dynamic programming algorithm search  'survey'   in  the text 'surgery" with two errors.

The shaded states are those active after reading the text 'surgery'. Unla-belled transitions match anv character. with k errors whenever the (fc -f l)-th rightmost state is active. It is not hard to see that once a state in the automaton is active, all the states of the same column and higher rows are active too. Moreover, at a given text character, if we collect the smallest active rows at each column, we obtain the current column of the dynamic programming algorithm. Figure 8.22 illustrates this (compare the figure with Figure 8.21). One solution is to make this automaton deterministic (DFA). Although the search phase is O(7i), the DFA can be huge. An alternative solution is based on bit-parallelism and is explained next. Bit-Parallelism Bit-parallelism has been used to parallelize the computation of the dynamic programming matrix (achieving average complexity O(kn/w)) and to parallelize the computation of the NFA (without converting it to deterministic), obtaining O(knwlw) time in the worst case. Such algorithms achieve O(n) search time for short patterns and are currently the fastest ones in many cases, running at 6 to 111 Mb per second on our reference machine. Filtering Finally, oilier approaches first filter the text, reducing the area where1 dynamic programming needs to be used. These algorithms achieve 'sublinear* expected time in many causes for low error ratios (i.e., not all text characters are inspected. PATTERN MATCHING        219 O(kn\oga{m)/m) is a typical figure), although the nitration is not effective for more errors. Filtration is based on the fact that some portions of the pattern must appear with no errors even in an approximate occurrence. The fastest algorithm for low error levels is based on filtering: if the pattern is split into /c +1 pieces, any approximate occurrence must contain at least one of the pieces with no errors, since k errors cannot alter all the k + 1 pieces. Hence, the search begins with a multipattern exact search for the pieces and it later verifies the areas that may contain a match (using another algorithm).
mir-0153	8.6.2    Regular Expressions and Extended Patterns General regular expressions are searched by building an automaton which finds all their occurrences in a text. This process first builds a non-deterministic finite automaton of size O(ra), where m is the length of the regular expression. The classical solution is to convert this automaton to deterministic form. A deterministic automaton can search any regular expression in O(n) time. However, its size and construction time can be exponential in m, i.e. O(m2m). See Figure 8.23. Excluding preprocessing, this algorithm runs at 6 Mb/sec in the reference machine. Recently the use of bit-parallelism has been proposed to avoid the construction of the deterministic automaton. The non-deterministic automaton is simulated instead. One bit per automaton state is used to represent whether the state is active or not. Due to the algorithm used to build the non-deterministic automaton, all the transitions move forward except for ^-transitions. The idea is that for each text character two steps are carried out. The first one moves forward, and the second one takes care of all the e-transitions. A function E from bit masks to bit masks is precomputed so that all the corresponding bits are moved according to the ^-transitions. Since this function is very large (i.e., 2m entries) its domain is split in many functions from 8- or 16-bit submasks to 7n-bit masks. This is possible because E(B\,..B3) ~ E{B\)\...\E(B3), where B% Figure 8.23    The non-deterministic (a) and deterministic (h) automata for the regular expression b b*   (b j b*a). 220        INDEXING AND SEARCHING are the submasks. Hence, the scheme performs |"m/8] or |~ra/16] operations per text character and needs [ra/8] 28 \m/w] or [ra/16]216|"m/it/] machine words of memory. Extended patterns can be rephrased as regular expressions and solved as before. However, in many cases it is more efficient to give them a specialized solution, as we saw for the extensions of exact searching (bit-parallel algorithms). Moreover, extended patterns can be combined with approximate search for maximum flexibility. In general, the bit-parallel approach is the best equipped to deal with extended patterns. Real times for regular expressions and extended pattern searching using this technique are between 2-8 Mb/sec.
mir-0154	8.6.3    Pattern Matching Using Indices We end this section by explaining how the indexing techniques we presented for simple searching of words can in fact be extended to search for more complex patterns. Inverted Files As inverted files are word-oriented, other types of queries such as suffix or substring queries, searching allowing errors and regular expressions, are solved by a sequential (i.e., online) search over the vocabulary. This is not too bad since the size of the vocabulary is small with respect to the text size. After either type of search, a list of vocabulary words that matched the query is obtained. All their lists of occurrences are now merged to retrieve a list of documents and (if required) the matching text positions. If block addressing is used and the positions are required or the blocks do not coincide with the retrieval unit, the search must be completed with a sequential search over the blocks. Notice that an inverted index is word-oriented. Because of that it is not surprising that it is not able to efficiently find approximate matches or regular expressions that span many words. This is a restriction of this scheme. Variations that are not subject to this restriction have been proposed for languages which do not have a clear concept of word, like Finnish. They collect text samples or n-grarns, which are fixed-length strings picked at regular text intervals. Searching is in genera! more powerful but more expensive. In a full-inverted index, search times for simple words allowing errors on 250 Mb of text took out reference machine from 0.6 to 0,85 seconds, while very complex expressions on extended patterns took from 0.8 to 3 seconds. As a comparison, the same collection cut in blocks of 1 Mb size takes more than 8 seconds for an approximate search with one error and more than 20 for two errors. PATTERN MATCHING        221 Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays If the suffix tree indexes all text positions it can search for words, prefixes, suffixes and substrings with the same search algorithm and cost described for word search. However, indexing all positions makes the index 10 to 20 times the text size for suffix trees. Range queries are easily solved too, by just searching both extremes in the trie and then collecting all the leaves which lie in the middle. In this case the cost is the height of the tree, which is O(logn) on average (excluding the tasks of collecting and sorting the leaves). Regular expressions can be searched in the suffix tree. The algorithm simply simulates sequential searching of the regular expression. It begins at the root, since any possible match starts there too. For each child of the current node labeled by the character c, it assumes that the next text character is c and recursively enters into that subtree. This is done for each of the children of the current node. The search stops only when the automaton has no transition to follow. It has been shown that for random text only O(nQ;polylog(n)) nodes are traversed (for 0 lt; a lt; 1 dependent on the regular expression). Hence, the search time is sublinear for regular expressions without the restriction that they must occur inside a word. Extended patterns can be searched in the same way by taking them as regular expressions. Unrestricted approximate string matching is also possible using the same idea. We present a simplified version here. Imagine that the search is online and traverse the tree recursively as before. Since all suffixes start at the root, any match starts at the root too, and therefore do not allow the match to start later. The search will automatically stop at depth m -f- k at most (since at that point more than k errors have occurred). This implies constant search time if n is large enough (albeit exponential on m and k). Other problems such as approximate search of extended patterns can be solved in the same way, using the appropriate online algorithm. Suffix trees are able to perform other complex searches that we have not considered in our query language (see Chapter 4). These are specialized operations which are useful in specific areas. Some examples are: find the longest substring in the text that appears more than once, find the most common substring of a fixed size, etc. If a suffix array indexes all text positions, any algorithm that works on suffix trees at C(n) cost will work on suffix arrays at O(C(n) log n) cost. This is because the operations performed on the suffix tree consist of descending to a child node, which is done in O(l) time. This operation can be simulated in the suffix array in O(logn) time by binary searching the new boundaries (each suffix tree node corresponds to a string, which can be mapped to the suffix array interval holding ail suffixes starting with that string). Some patterns can be searched directly in the suffix array in O(logn) total search time without simulating the suffix tree. These are: word, prefix, suffix and subword search, as well as range search. However, again, indexing all text positions normally makes the suffix array 222        INDEXING AND SEARCHING size four times or more the text size. A different alternative for suffix arrays is to index only word beginnings and to use a vocabulary supra-index, using the same search algorithms used for the inverted lists.
mir-0155	8.7    Structural Queries The algorithms to search on structured text (see Chapter 4) are largely dependent on each model. We extract their common features in this section. A first concern about this problem is how to store the structural information. Some implementations build an ad hoc index to store the structure. This is potentially more efficient and independent of any consideration about the text. However, it requires extra development and maintenance effort. Other techniques assume that the structure is marked in the text using 'tags' (i.e., strings that identify the structural elements). This is the case with HTML text but not the case with C code where the marks are implicit and are inherent to C. The technique relies on the same index to query content (such as inverted files), using it to index and search those tags as if they were words. In many cases this is as efficient as an ad hoc index, and its integration into an existing text database is simpler. Moreover, it is possible to define the structure dynamically, since the appropriate tags can be selected at search time. For that goal, inverted files are better since they naturally deliver the results in text order, which makes the structure information easier to obtain. On the other hand, some queries such as direct ancestry are hard to answer without an ad hoc index. Once the content and structural elements have been found by using some index, a set of answers is generated. The models allow further operations to be applied on tiiose answers, such as 'select all areas in the left-hand argument which contain an area of the right-hand argument/ This is in general solved in a way very similar to the set manipulation techniques already explained in section 8.4. However, the operations tend to be more complex, and it is not always possible to find an evaluation algorithm which has linear time with respect to the size of the intermediate results. It is worth mentioning that some models use completely different algorithms, such as exhaustive search techniques for tree pattern matching. Those problems are NP-complete in many cases.
mir-0156	8.8    Compression In this section we discuss the issues of searching compressed text directly and of searching compressed indices. Compression is important when available storage is a limiting factor, as is the case of indexing the Web. Searching and compression were traditionally regarded as exclusive operations. Texts which were not to be searched could be compressed, and to search COMPRESSION        223 a compressed text it had to be decompressed first. In recent years, very efficient compression techniques have appeared that allow searching directly in the compressed text. Moreover, the search performance is improved, since the CPU times are similar but the disk times are largely reduced. This leads to a win-win situation. Discussion on how common text and lists of numbers can be compressed has been covered in Chapter 7.
mir-0157	8.8.1    Sequential Searching A few approaches to directly searching compressed text exist. One of the most successful techniques in practice relies on Huffman coding taking words as symbols. That is, consider each different text word as a symbol, count their frequencies, and generate a Huffman codefor the words. Then, compress the text by replacing each word with its code. To improve compression/decompression efficiency, the Huffman code uses an alphabet of bytes instead of bits. This scheme compresses faster and better than known commercial systems, even those based on Ziv-Lempel coding. Since Huffman coding needs to store the codes of each symbol, this scheme has to store the whole vocabulary of the text, i.e. the list of all different text words. This is fully exploited to efficiently search complex queries. Although according to Heaps' law the vocabulary (i.e., the alphabet) grows as 0{n) for 0 lt; (3 lt; 1, the generalized Zipf's law shows that the distribution is skewed enough so that the entropy remains constant (i.e., the compression ratio will not degrade as the text grows). Those laws are explained in Chapter 6. Any single-wrord or pattern query is first searched in the vocabulary. Some queries can be binary searched, while others such as approximate searching or regular expression searching must traverse sequentially all the vocabulary. This vocabulary is rather small compared to the text size, thanks to Heaps' law. Notice that this process is exactly the same as the vocabulary searching performed by inverted indices, either for simple or complex pattern matching. Once that search is complete, the list of different words that match the query is obtained. The Huffman codes of all those wrords are collected and they are searched in the compressed text. One alternative is to traverse byte-wise the compressed text and traverse the Huffman decoding tree in synchronization, so that each time that a leaf is reached, it is checked whether the leaf (i.e., word) was marked as 'matching' the query or not. This is illustrated in Figure 8.24. Boyer-Moore filtering can be used to speed up the search. Solving phrases is a little more difficult. Each element is searched in the vocabulary. For each word of the vocabulary we define a bit mask. We set the /-th bit in the mask of all words which match with the i-th element of the phrase query. This is used together with the Shift-Or algorithm. The text is traversed byte-wise, and only when a leaf is reached, does the Shift-Or algorithm consider that a new text symbol has been read, whose bit mask is that of the leaf (see Figure 8.24). This algorithm is surprisingly simple and efficient. 224        INDEXING AND SEARCHING EH cm cm cm cm m cm cm cm cm Huffman tree cm Vocabulary      Marks cm cm cm cm cm cm n cm Huffman tree rrooi rrfoi ["Tool CZH Vocabulary      Marks Figure 8.24 On the left, searching for the simple pattern 'rose' allowing one error. On the right, searching for the phrase 'ro* rose is,' where 'ro*' represents a prefix search. This scheme is especially fast when it comes to solving a complex query (regular expression, extended pattern, approximate search, etc.) that would be slow with a normal algorithm. This is because the complex search is done only in the small vocabulary, after which the algorithm is largely insensitive to the complexity of the originating query. Its CPU times for a simple pattern are slightly higher than those of Agrep (briefly described in section 8.5.6). However, if the I/O times are considered, compressed searching is faster than all the online algorithms. For complex queries, this scheme is unbeaten by far. On the reference machine, the CPU times are 14 Mb/sec for any query, while for simple queries this improves to 18 Mb/sec if the speedup technique is used. Agrep, on the other hand, runs at 15 Mb/sec on simple searches and at 1-4 Mb/sec for complex ones. Moreover, I/O times are reduced to one third on the compressed text.
mir-0158	8.8.2    Compressed Indices Inverted Files Inverted files are quite amenable to compression. This is because the lists of occurrences are in increasing order of text position. Therefore, an obvious choice is to represent the differences between the previous position and the current one. These differences can be represented using less space by using techniques that favor small numbers (see Chapter 7). Notice that, the longer the lists, the smaller the differences. Reductions in 909? for block-addressing indices with blocks of 1 Kb size have been reported. It is important to notice that compression does not necessarily degrade time performance. Most of the time spent in answering a query is in the disk transfer. Keeping the index compressed allows the transference of less data, and it may be worth the CPU work (if decompressing. Notice also that the lists of COMPRESSION        225 occurrences are normally traversed in a sequential manner, which is not affected by a differential compression. Query times on compressed or decompressed indices are reported to be roughly similar. The text can also be compressed independently of the index. The text will be decompressed only to display it, or to traverse it in case of block addressing. Notice in particular that the online search technique described for compressed text in section 8.8.1 uses a vocabulary. It is possible to integrate both techniques (compression and indexing) such that they share the same vocabulary for both tasks and they do not decompress the text to index or to search. Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays Some efforts to compress suffix trees have been pursued. Important reductions of the space requirements have been obtained at the cost of more expensive searching. However, the reduced space requirements happen to be similar to those of uncompressed suffix arrays, which impose much smaller performance penalties. Suffix arrays are very hard to compress further. This is because they represent an almost perfectly random permutation of the pointers to the text. However, the subject of building suffix arrays on compressed text has been pursued. Apart from reduced space requirements (the index plus the compressed text take less space than the uncompressed text), the main advantage is that both index construction and querying almost double their performance. Construction is faster because more compressed text fits in the same memory space, and therefore fewer text blocks are needed. Searching is faster because a large part of the search time is spent in disk seek operations over the text area to compare suffixes. If the text is smaller, the seeks reduce proportionally. A compression technique very similar to that shown in section 8.8.1 is used. However, the Huffman code on words is replaced by a Hu-Tucker coding. The Hu-Tucker code respects the lexicographical relationships between the words, and therefore direct binary search over the compressed text is possible (this is necessary at construction and search time). This code is suboptimal by a very small percentage (2-3% in practice, with an analytical upper bound of 5%). Indexing times for 250 Mb of text on the reference machine are close to 1.6 Mb/min if compression is used, while query times are reduced to 0.5 seconds in total and 0.3 seconds for the text alone. Supra-indices should reduce the total search time to 0.15 seconds. Signature Files There are many alternative ways to compress signature files.   All of them are based on the fact that only a few bits are set in the whole file. It is then possible 226 INDEXING AND SEARCHING to use efficient methods to code the bits which are not set, for instance run-length encoding. Different considerations arise if the file is stored as a sequence of bit masks or with one file per bit of the mask. They allow us to reduce space and hence disk times, or alternatively to increase B (so as to reduce the false drop probability) keeping the same space overhead. Compression ratios near 70% are reported.
mir-0159	8.9    Trends and Research Issues In this chapter we covered extensively the current techniques of dealing with text retrieval. We first covered indices and then online searching. We then reviewed set manipulation, complex pattern matching and finally considered compression techniques. Figure 8.25 summarizes the tradeoff between the space needed for the index and the time to search one single word.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        227 Probably the most adequate indexing technique in practice is the inverted file. As we have shown throughout the chapter, many hidden details in other structures make them harder to use and less efficient in practice, as well as less flexible for dealing with new types of queries. These structures, however, still find application in restricted areas such as genetic databases (for suffix trees and arrays, for the relatively small texts used and their need to pose specialized queries) or some office systems (for signature files, because the text is rarely queried in fact). The main trends in indexing and searching textual databases today are ï  Text collections are becoming huge. This poses more demanding requirements at all levels, and solutions previously affordable are not any more.   On the other hand, the speed of the processors and the relative slowness of external devices have changed what a few years ago were reasonable options (e.g., it is better to keep a text compressed because reading less text from disk and decompressing in main memory pays off). ï  Searching is becoming more complex.   As the text databases grow and become more heterogeneous and error-prone, enhanced query facilities are required, such as exploiting the text structure or allowing errors in the text. Good support for extended queries is becoming important in the evaluation of a text retrieval system. ï  Compression is becoming a star in the field. Because of the changes mentioned in the time cost of processors and external devices, and because of new developments in the area, text retrieval and compression are no longer regarded as disjoint activities.   Direct indexing and searching on compressed text provides better (sometimes much better) time performance and less space overhead at the same time. Other techniques such as block addressing trade space for processor time.
mir-0160	8.10    Bibliographic Discussion A detailed explanation of a full inverted index and its construction and querying process can be found in [26]. This work also includes an analysis of the algorithms on inverted lists using the distribution of natural language, The in-place construction is described in [572], Another construction algorithm is presented in [341]. The idea of block addressing inverted indices was first presented in a system called Glimpse [540], which also first exposed the idea of performing complex pattern matching using the vocabulary of the inverted index. Block addressing indices are analyzed in [42], where some performance improvements are proposed. The variant that indexes sequences instead of words has been implemented in a system called Grampse, which is described in [497]. Suffix arrays were presented in [538] together with the algorithm to build them in O(n log n) character comparisons. They were independently discovered 228        INDEXING AND SEARCHING by [309] under the name of TAT arrays.' The algorithm to build large suffix arrays is presented in [311]. The use of supra-indices over suffix array is proposed in [37], while the modified binary search techniques to reduce disk seek time are presented in [56]. The linear-time construction of suffix trees is described in [780]. The material on signature files is based on [243]. The different alternative ways of storing the signature file are explained in [242]. The original references for the sequential search algorithms are: KMP [447], BM [110], BMH [376], BMS [751], Shift-Or [39], BDM [205] and BNDM [592]. The multipattem versions are found in [9, 179], and MultiBDM in [196]. Many enhancements of bit-parallelism to support extended patterns and allow errors are presented in [837]. Many ideas from that paper were implemented in a widely distributed software for online searching called Agrep [836]. The reader interested in more details about sequential searching algorithms may look for the original references or in good books on algorithms such as [310, 196]. One source for the classical solution to approximate string matching is [716]. An O(kn) worst-case algorithm is described in [480]. The use of a DFA is proposed in [781]. The bit-parallel approach to this problem started in [837], although currently the fastest bit-parallel algorithms are [583] and [43]. Among all the filtering algorithms, the fastest one in practice is based on an idea presented in [837], later enhanced in [45], and finally implemented in [43]. A good source from which to learn about regular expressions and building a DFA is [375]. The bit-parallel implementation of the NFA is explained in [837]. Regular expression searching on suffix trees is described in [40], while searching allowing errors is presented in [779]. The Huffman coding was first presented in [386], while the word-oriented alternative is proposed in [571]. Sequential searching on text compressed using that technique is described in [577]. Compression used in combination with inverted files is described in [850], with suffix trees in [430], with suffix arrays in [575], and with signature files in [243, 242]. A good general reference on compression is [78].
mir-0162	9.1     Introduction The volume of electronic text available online today is staggering. By many accounts, the World Wide Web alone contains over 200 million pages of text, comprising nearly 500 gigabytes of data. Moreover, the Web (see Chapter 13) has been growing at an exponential rate, nearly doubling in size every six months. Large information service providers, such as LEXIS-NEXIS (see Chapter 14), have amassed document databases that reach into the terabytes. On a slightly smaller scale, the largest corporate intranets now contain over a million Web pages. Even private collections of online documents stored on personal computers are growing larger as disk space becomes cheaper and electronic content becomes easier to produce, download, and store. As document collections grow larger, they become more expensive to manage with an information retrieval system. Searching and indexing costs grow with the size of the underlying document collection; larger document collections invariably result in longer response times. As more documents are added to the system, performance may deteriorate to the point where the system is no longer usable. Furthermore, the economic survival of commercial systems and Web search engines depends on their ability to provide high query processing rates. In fact, most of a Web search company's gross income comes from selling 'advertising impressions' (advertising banners displayed at the user's screen) whose number is proportional to the number of query requests attended. To support the demanding requirements of modern search environments, we must turn to alternative architectures and algorithms. In this chapter we explore parallel and distributed information retrieval techniques. The application of parallelism can greatly enhance our ability to scale traditional information retrieval algorithms and support larger and larger document collections. We continue this introduction with a review of parallel computing and parallel program performance measures. In section 9.2 we explore techniques for 229 230        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR implementing information retrieval algorithms on parallel platforms, including inverted file and signature file methods. In section 9.3, we turn to distributed information retrieval and approaches to collection partitioning, source selection, and distributed results merging (often called collection fusion). We discuss future trends in section 9.4, and conclude with a bibliographic discussion in section 9.5.
mir-0163	9.1.1    Parallel Computing Parallel computing is the simultaneous application of multiple processors to solve a single problem, where each processor works on a different part of the problem. With parallel computing, the overall time required to solve the problem can be reduced to the amount of time required by the longest running part. As long as the problem can be further decomposed into more parts that will run in parallel, we can add more processors to the system, reduce the time required to solve the problem, and scale up to larger problems. Processors can be combined in a variety of ways to form parallel architectures. Flynn [259] has defined a commonly used taxonomy of parallel architectures based on the number of the instruction and data streams in the architecture. The taxonomy includes four classes: ï  SISD single instruction stream, single data stream ï  SIMD single instruction stream, multiple data stream ï  MISD multiple instruction stream, single data stream ï  MIMD multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream. The SISD class includes the traditional von Neumann [134] computer running sequential programs, e.g., uniprocessor personal computers. SIMD computers consist of AT processors operating on N data streams, with each processor executing the same instruction at the same time.   Machines in this class are often massively parallel computers with many relatively simple processors, a communication network between the processors, and a control unit that supervises the synchronous operation of the processors, e.g., the Thinking Machines CM-2. The processors may use shared memory, or each processor may have its own local memory. Sequential programs require significant modification to make effective use of a SIMD architecture, and not all problems lend themselves to a SIMD implementation. MISD computers use N processors operating on a single data stream in shared memory. Each processor executes its own instruct ion stream, such that multiple operations are performed simultaneously on the same data item. MISD architectures are relatively rare. Systolic arrays are the best known example. MIMD is the most general and most popular class of parallel architectures. A MIMD computer contains N processors, A" instruction streams, and Ar data streams.   The processors are similar to those used in a SISD computer; each INTRODUCTION        231 processor has its own control unit, processing unit, and local memory.f MIMD systems usually include shared memory or a communication network that connects the processors to each other. The processors can work on separate, unrelated tasks, or they can cooperate to solve a single task, providing a great deal of flexibility. MIMD systems with a high degree of processor interaction are called tightly coupled, while systems with a low degree of processor interaction are loosely coupled. Examples of MIMD systems include multiprocessor PC servers, symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) such as the Sun HPC Server, and scalable parallel processors such as the IBM SP2. Although MIMD typically refers to a single, self-contained parallel computer using two or more of the same kind of processor, MIMD also characterizes distributed computing architectures. In distributed computing, multiple computers connected by a local or wide area network cooperate to solve a single problem. Even though the coupling between processors is very loose in a distributed computing environment, the basic components of the MIMD architecture remain. Each computer contains a processor, control unit, and local memory, and the local or wide area network forms the communication network between the processors. The main difference between a MIMD parallel computer and a distributed computing environment is the cost of interprocessor communication, which is considerably higher in a distributed computing environment. As such, distributed programs are usually coarse grained, while programs running on a single parallel computer tend to be finer grained. Granularity refers to the amount of computation relative to the amount of communication performed by the program. Coarse-grained programs perform large amounts of computation relative to communication; fine-grained programs perform large amounts of communication relative to computation. Of course, an application may use different levels of granularity at different times to solve a given problem.
mir-0164	9.1.2    Performance Measures When we employ parallel computing, we usually want to know what sort of performance improvement we are obtaining over a comparable sequential program running on a uniprocessor.   A number of metrics are available to measure the performance of a parallel algorithm. One such measure is the speedup obtained with the parallel algorithm relative to the best available sequential algorithm for solving the same problem, defined as: __ Running time of best available sequential algorithm Running time of parallel algorithm I The processors used in a MIMD system may be identical to those used in SISD systems, or they may provide additional functionality, such as hardware cache coherence for shared memory. 232        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR Ideally, when running a parallel algorithm on N processors, we would obtain perfect speedup, or S = N. In practice, perfect speedup is unattainable either because the problem cannot be decomposed into N equal subtasks, the parallel architecture imposes control overheads (e.g., scheduling or synchronization), or the problem contains an inherently sequential component. Amdahl's law [18] states that the maximal speedup obtainable for a given problem is related to /, the fraction of the problem that must be computed sequentially. The relationship is given by: Another measure of parallel algorithm performance is efficiency, given by: where S is speedup and N is the number of processors. Ideal efficiency occurs when 0=1 and no processor is ever idle or performs unnecessary work. As with perfect speedup, ideal efficiency is unattainable in practice. Ultimately, the performance improvement of a parallel program over a sequential program should be viewed in terms of the reduction in real time required to complete the processing task combined with the additional monetary cost associated with the parallel hardware required to run the parallel program. This gives the best overall picture of parallel program performance and cost effectiveness.
mir-0166	9.2.1    Introduction We can approach the development of parallel information retrieval algorithms from two different directions. One possibility is to develop new retrieval strategies that directly lend themselves to parallel implementation. For example, a text search procedure can be built on top of a neural network. Neural networks (see Chapter 2) are modeled after the human brain and solve problems using a large number of nodes (neurons), each of which has a set of inputs, a threshold, and an output. The output of one node is connected to the input of one or more other nodes, with the boundaries of the network defining the initial input and final output of the system. A node's output value is determined by a weighted function of the node's inputs and threshold. A training procedure is used to learn appropriate settings for the weights and thresholds in the network. Computation proceeds by applying input values to the network, computing each active node's output value, and conditioning these values through the network until the final output values are obtained. Neural networks naturally lend themselves to parallel implementation on SIMD hardware. The challenge with this approach is to PARALLEL IR        233 define the retrieval task in such a way that it maps well onto the computational paradigm. The other possibility is to adapt existing, well studied information retrieval algorithms to parallel processing. This is the approach that we will consider throughout the rest of this chapter. The modifications required to adapt an existing algorithm to parallel implementation depend on the target parallel platform. We will investigate techniques for applying a number of retrieval algorithms to both MIMD and SIMD architectures. Since parallel information retrieval is still very much an active research area, few approaches have fallen out as accepted standard techniques. We will, therefore, present a sampling of the work that has been done and avoid preferring one technique over another.
mir-0167	9.2.2     MIMD Architectures MIMD architectures offer a great deal of flexibility in how parallelism is defined and exploited to solve a problem. The simplest way in which a retrieval system can exploit a MIMD computer is through the use of multitasking. Each of the processors in the parallel computer runs a separate, independent search engine. The search engines do not cooperate to process individual queries, but they may share code libraries and data cached by the file system or loaded into shared memory. The submission of user queries to the search engines is managed by a broker, which accepts search requests from the end users and distributes the requests among the available search engines. This is depicted in Figure 9.1. As more processors are added to the system, more search engines may be run and more search requests may be processed in parallel, increasing the throughput of the system. Note, however, that the response time of individual queries remains unchanged. In spite of the simplicity of this approach, care must be taken to properly balance the hardware resources on the system. In particular, as the number of processors grows, so must the number of disks and I/O channels. Unless the entire retrieval index fits in main memory, the search processes running on the different processors will perform I/O and compete for disk access. A bottleneck at the disk will be disastrous for performance and could eliminate the throughput gains anticipated from the addition of more processors. In addition to adding more disks to the computer, the system administrator must properly distribute the index data over the disks. Disk contention will remain as long as two search processes need to access index data stored on the same disk. At one extreme, replicating the entire index on each disk eliminates disk contention at the cost of increased storage requirements and update complexity. Alternatively, the system administrator may partition and replicate index data across the disks according to profile information; heavily accessed data is replicated while less frequently accessed data is distributed randomly. Yet another approach is to install a disk array, or RAID [165], and let the operating system handle partitioning the index. Disk arrays can provide low latency and high throughput disk access by striping files across many disks. 234 PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR User Query ^		User Query Broker   Result Result Figure 9.1    Parallel multitasking on a MIMD machine. To move beyond multitasking and improve query response time, the computation required to evaluate a single query must be partitioned into subtasks and distributed among the multiple processors, as shown in Figure 9.2. In this configuration the broker and search processes run in parallel on separate processors as before, but now they all cooperate to evaluate the same query. High level processing in this system proceeds as follows. The broker accepts a query from the end user and distributes it among the search processes. Each of the search processes then evaluates a portion of the query and transmits an intermediate result back to the broker. Finally, the broker combines the intermediate results into a final result for presentation to the end user. Since IR computation is typically characterized by a small amount of processing per datum applied to a large amount of data, how to partition the computation boils down to a question of how to partition the data. Figure 9.3 presents a high level view of the data processed by typical search algorithms (see Chapter 8). Each row represents a document, djlt; and each column represents an indexing item, kt. Here, k{ may be a term, phrase, concept, or a more abstract indexing item such as a dimension in an LSI vector or a bit in a document signature. The entries in the matrix, wlnJ, are (possibly binary) weights, indicating if and to what degree indexing item i is assigned to document j. The indexing item weights associated with a particular document form a vector, d3 = (u'i,j.....Wtj)- During search, a query is also represented as a vector of indexing item weights, q = {iv\^___tr^9), and the search algorithm scores each document by applying a matching function F(dj,lt;[) = sim(dj,q). This high level data representation reveals two possible methods for partitioning the data. The first method, document partitioning, slices the data matrix horizontally, dividing the documents among the subtasks. The X documents in the collection are distributed across the P processors in the system.

During query processing, each parallel process (one for each processor) evaluates the query on the subcollection of N/P documents assigned to it, and the results from each of the subcollections are combined into a final result list. The second method, term partitioning, slices the data matrix vertically, dividing the Indexing items among the P processors such that the evaluation procedure for each document is spread over multiple processors in the system. Below we consider both of these partitioning schemes for each of the three main index structures. Inverted Files We first discuss inverted files for systems that employ document partitioning. Following that, we cover systems that employ term partitioning. Tiiere are two approaches to document partitioning in systems that use inverted files, namely, logical document partitioning and physical document partitioning. 236        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR Dictionary Inverted List Term / term /   PO  PI  PZ  P3      Figure 9.4    Extended dictionary entry for document partitioning. Logical Document Partitioning In this case, the data partitioning is done logically using essentially the same basic underlying inverted file index as in the original sequential algorithm (see Chapter 8). The inverted file is extended to give each parallel process (one for each processor) direct access to that portion of the index related to the processor's subcollection of documents. Each term dictionary entry is extended to include P pointers into the corresponding inverted list, where the j-th pointer indexes the block of document entries in the inverted list associated with the subcollection in the j-th processor. This is shown in Figure 9.4, where the dictionary entry for term i contains four pointers into term fs inverted list, one for each parallel process (P = 4). When a query is submitted to the system, the broker (from Figure 9.2) first ensures that the necessary term dictionary and inverted file entries are loaded into shared memory, where all of the parallel processes can access a single shared copy. The broker then initiates P parallel processes to evaluate the query. Each process executes the same document scoring algorithm on its document subcollection, using the extended dictionary to access the appropriate entries in the inverted file. Since all of the index operations during query processing are read-only, there is no lock contention among the processes for access to the shared term dictionary and inverted file. The search processes record document scores in a single shared array of document score accumulators and notify the broker when they have completed. Updates to the accumulator array do not produce lock contention either since the subcollections scored by the different search processes are mutually exclusive. After all of the search processes have finished, the broker sorts the array of document score accumulators and produces the final ranked list of documents. PARALLEL IR        237 At inverted file construction time, the indexing process for logically partitioned documents can exploit the parallel processors using a variant of the indexing scheme described by Brown [123] (see Chapter 8). First, the indexer partitions the documents among the processors. Next, it assigns document identifiers such that all identifiers in partition i are less than all identifiers in partition i + 1. The indexer then runs a separate indexing process on each processor in parallel Each indexing process generates a batch of inverted lists, sorted by indexing item. After all of the batches have been generated, a merge step is performed to create the final inverted file. Since the inverted lists in each batch are sorted the same way, a binary heap-based priority queue is used to assemble the inverted list components from each batch that correspond to the current indexing item. The components are concatenated in partition number order to produce a final inverted list and a dictionary entry for the indexing item is created that includes the additional indexing pointers shown in Figure 9.4. Physical Document Partitioning In this second approach to document partitioning, the documents are physically partitioned into separate, self-contained subcollections, one for each parallel processor. Each subcollection has its own inverted file and the search processes share nothing during query evaluation. When a query is submitted to the system, the broker distributes the query to all of the parallel search processes. Each parallel search process evaluates the query on its portion of the document collection, producing a local, intermediate hit-list. The broker then collects the intermediate hit-lists from all of the parallel search processes and merges them into a final hit-list. The P intermediate hit-lists can be merged efficiently using a binary heap-based priority queue [188]. A priority queue of n elements has the property that element i is greater than elements 2i and 2i 4-1, where i ranges from 1 to n. A priority queue is not fully sorted, but the maximal element is always immediately available (i.e., in 6(1) time) and can be extracted in O(logn) time. Inserting an element into a priority queue can be done in O(logra) time as well. To merge the intermediate hit-lists, a priority queue of P elements is created with the first entry from each intermediate hit-list inserted into the queue in O(Plog P) time. To generate the final (and global) hit-list with the top k retrieved documents (in a global ranking), k elements are extracted from the priority queue. As each element is extracted from the priority queue, the intermediate hit-list from which the element was originally drawn inserts a new element into the priority queue. The P intermediate hit-lists can be merged into a final hit-list of A^ elements in O((P^k) log P) time. The merge procedure just described assumes that the parallel search processes produce globally consistent document scores, i.e., document scores that can be merged directly. Depending on the ranking algorithm in use, each parallel search process may require global term statistics in order to produce globally consistent document scores. There are two basic approaches to collect information on global term statistics. The first approach is to compute global term statistics at indexing time and store these statistics with each of the subcollec238        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR tions. The second approach is for the query processing to proceed in two phases. During the first phase, the broker collects subcollection term statistics from each of the search processes and combines them into global term statistics. During the second phase, the broker distributes the query and global term statistics to the search processes and query evaluation proceeds as before. The first solution offers better query processing performance at the expense of more complex indexing, while the second solution allows subcollections to be built and maintained independently at the expense of doubling communication costs during query evaluation. To build the inverted files for physically partitioned documents, each processor creates, in parallel, its own complete index corresponding to its document partition. If global collection statistics are stored in the separate term dictionaries, then a merge step must be performed that accumulates the global statistics for all of the partitions and distributes them to each of the partition dictionaries. Logical document partitioning requires less communication than physical document partitioning with similar parallelization, and so is likely to provide better overall performance. Physical document partitioning, on the other hand, offers more flexibility (e.g., document partitions may be searched individually) and conversion of an existing IR system into a parallel IR system is simpler using physical document partitioning. For either document partitioning scheme, threads provide a convenient programming paradigm for creating the search processes, controlling their operation, and communicating between them. Threads are natively supported in some modern programming languages (e.g., Java [491]) and well supported in a standard way in others (e.g., POSIX threads in C/C++). Thread packages allow programmers to develop parallel programs using high level abstractions of concurrent execution, communication, and synchronization. The compiler and runtime system then map these abstractions to efficient operating system services and shared memory operations. Term Partitioning When term partitioning is used with an inverted file-based system, a single inverted file is created for the document collection (using the parallel construction technique described above for logical document partitioning) and the inverted lists are spread across the processors. During query evaluation, the query is decomposed into indexing items and each indexing item is sent to the processor that holds the corresponding inverted list. The processors create hit-lists with partial document scores and return them to the broker. The broker then combines the hit-lists according to the semantics of the query. For Boolean queries, the hit-lists are unioned, intersected, or subtracted as appropriate. For ranked free text queries, the hit-lists contain term scores that must be combined according to the semantics of the ranking formula. In comparison, document partitioning affords simpler inverted index construction and maintenance than term partitioning. Their relative performance during query processing was shown by Jeorig and Omieiinski [404] to depend on term distributions. Assuming each processor has its own I/O channel and disks, when term distributions in the documents and the queries are more skewed. PARALLEL IR        239 document partitioning performs better. When terms are uniformly distributed in user queries, term partitioning performs better. For instance, using TREC data, Ribeiro-Neto and Barbosa [673, 57] have shown that term partitioning might be twice as fast with long queries and 5-10 times faster with very short (Web-like) queries. Suffix Arrays We can apply document partitioning to suffix arrays in a straightforward fashion. As with physical document partitioning for inverted files, the document collection is divided among the P processors and each partition is treated as an independent, self-contained collection. The system can then apply the suffix array construction techniques described in Chapter 8 to each of the partitions, with the enhancement that all of the partitions are indexed concurrently. During search, the broker broadcasts the query to all of the search processes, collects the intermediate results, and merges the intermediate results into a final hit-list. If all of the documents will be kept in a single collection, we can still exploit the parallel processors to reduce indexing time. An interesting property of the suffix array construction algorithm for large texts (described in Chapter 8) is that each of the merges of partial indices is independent. Therefore all of the O((n/M)2) merges may be run in parallel on separate processors. After all merges are complete, the counters for each partial index must be accumulated and the final index merge may be performed. Term partitioning for a suffix array amounts to distributing a single suffix array over multiple processors such that each processor is responsible for a lexicographical interval of the array. During query processing, the broker distributes the query to the processors that contain the relevant portions of the suffix array and merges the results. Note that when searching the suffix array, all of the processors require access to the entire text. On a single parallel computer with shared memory (e.g., an SMP system), this is not a problem since the text may be cached in shared memory. This may be a problem, however, if shared memory is not available and communication costs are high, as is the case in a distributed system (e.g., a network of workstations). Signature Files To implement document partitioning in a system that uses signature files, the documents are divided among the processors as before and each processor generates signatures for Its document partition. At query time, the broker generates a signature for the query and distributes it to all of the parallel processors. Each processor evaluates the query signature locally as If Its document partition was a separate, self-contained collection. Then the results axe sent to the broker, which combines them into a final hit-list for the user. For Boolean queries, the final result is simply a union of the results returned from each processor.  For 240        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR ranked queries, the ranked hit-lists are merged as described above for inverted file implementations. To apply term partitioning in a signature file-based system, we would have to use a bit-sliced signature file [627] and partition the bit slices across the processors. The amount of sequential work required to merge the intermediate results from each of the processors and eliminate false drops, however, severely limits the speedup 5 available with this organization. Accordingly, this organization is not recommended.
mir-0168	9.2.3    SSMD Architectures SIMD architectures lend themselves to a more restricted domain of problems than MIMD architectures. As such, SIMD computers are less common than MIMD computers. Perhaps the best known example of the SIMD architecture is the Thinking Machines CM-2, which has been used to support both signature file- and inverted file-based information retrieval algorithms. Each processing element in the CM-2 has a 1 bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and a small amount of local memory. The processing elements execute local and non-local parallel instructions. A local parallel instruction causes each processing element to perform the same operation in unison on data stored in the element's local memory. A non-local parallel instruction involves communication between the processing elements and includes operations such as summing the components of a vector or finding a global maximum. The CM-2 uses a separate front-end host computer to provide an interface to the back-end parallel processing elements. The front-end controls the loading and unloading of data in the back-end and executes serial program instructions, such as condition and iteration statements. Parallel macro instructions are sent from the front-end to a back-end microcontroller, which controls the simultaneous execution of the instruction on a set of back-end processing elements. The CM-2 provides a layer of abstraction over the back-end processors, called virtual processors. One or more virtual processors map to a single physical processor. Programs express their processing needs in terms of virtual processors, and the hardware maps virtual processor operations onto physical processors. A physical processor must sequentially perform the operations for each of its virtual processors. The ratio of virtual to physical processors is called the virtual processing ratio, VP. As VP increases, an approximately linear increase in running time occurs. Signature Files The most natural application of a SIMD computer in IR is to support signature files. Recall from Chapter 8 the basic search process for signature files. First, the search system constructs a signature for the query terms. Next, the system compares the query signature with the signature of every document in the collection and marks documents with matching signatures as potentially relevant. PARALLEL IR        241 probe_doc   (P_bit Doc_sig[],   char *term) { int       i; P__int Doc.match; Doc_match = 1; for   (i ´ 0;   i  lt; numjiashes;   i++)   i Doc.match = Doc_sig[hash  (i,   term)]; } return Doc_match; Figure 9.5    probe_doc. Finally, the system scans the full text of potentially relevant documents to eliminate false drops, ranks the matching documents, and returns the hit-list to the user. If the probability of false drops is acceptably low, the full text scan may be eliminated. Also, if the system is processing Boolean queries, it may need to generate more than one signature for the query and combine the intermediate results of each signature according to the operators used in the query. Stanfill [741] shows how this procedure can be adapted to the CM-2 (or any similar SIMD machine). The core of the procedure is the subroutine shown in Figure 9.54 This routine probes the document signature Doc.sig for the given query word term by applying each of the signature hash functions to term and ANDing together the corresponding bits in Doc.sig. The result of the AND operation is stored in Doc_match. If Doc_match is 1, term is present in Doc.sig; if Doc_match is 0, term is absent. Both Doc_sig and Doc_match are parallel variables, such that each virtual processor operates in parallel on its own copy of the variables. By loading the entire signature file onto the back-end virtual processors, all of the document signatures can be searched in parallel. This procedure must be enhanced under the following condition. If the number of words in a document |d| exceeds the number of words W that can be inserted into a document signature, then the document must be segmented into I^l/IF segments and represented by |d|/W signatures. In this case, the probe_doc routine is applied to all signatures for a document and an OR is taken over the individual signature results to obtain the final result for the document. If the false drop probability warrants scanning the full text of the documents. only those segments with matching signatures need be scanned. As soon as a qualifying segment is found, the entire document is marked as a match for the query. % The algorithms shown in this chapter are presented using a C-like pseudo-code.   Parallel data type names begin with a capital kP\ 242        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR bool_search r	'PJbit Doc_sig[] , bquery_t query) switch (query.op) { case AND return	(bool_search (Doc_sig, query,argl)  bool_search (Doc_sig, query.arg2)); case OR: return	(bool_search (Doc_sig, query.argl) I! bool_search (Doc_sig, query.arg2)); case NOT return	(!bool_search (Doc_sig, query.argl)); case WORD: return gt; }	(probe_doc (Doc.sig, query.argl)); Figure 9.6    bool_search. A general Boolean retrieval system can be implemented on top of probe_doc with the recursive procedure shown in Figure 9.6. Here bquery.t is a recursive data type that contains two arguments and an operator. If the operator is NOT or WORD, then the second argument in the bquery_t is empty. The final return value is stored in a parallel Boolean variable, which indicates for each document whether or not that document satisfies the Boolean query. Again, if the probability of false drops associated with the signature scheme is acceptably low, the set of matching documents may be returned immediately. Otherwise, the system must perform further processing on the text of each matching document to eliminate false drops. If weights are available for the query terms, it is possible to build a ranking retrieval system on top of the parallel signature file search process. Query term weights could be supplied by the end-user when the query is created, or they could be assigned by the system using a collection statistic such as idf (see Chapter 2). The algorithm in Figure 9.7 shows how to use probe_doc to build a ranking system. In rank_search, the wqueryjt data type contains an array of query terms and an array of weights associated with those terms. First, all documents that contain the current term are identified with probe_doc. Next, the score for each of those documents is updated by adding the weight associated with the current query term (the where clause tests a parallel variable expression and activates only those processors that satisfy the expression). After all query terms have been processed, the parallel variable Doc.score contains the rank scores for all of the documents. The final step in the processing of a weighted query is to rank the scored documents by sorting and returning the top k hits. This can be accomplished in PARALLEL IR        243 rank_search (P_bit Doc_sig[], wquery_t query) { int    i; P_float Doc.score; P_bool Doc_match; Doc_score = 0; for  (i = 0;   i lt; query.num_terms;   i++)   { Docjaatch = probe_doc   (Doc_sig,  query.terms[i]): where  (Docjmatch)   { Doc_score += query.weights[i]; return  (Doc_score); gt; Figure 9.7    rank.search. a number of ways. One possibility is to use the global ranking routine provided by the CM-2, which takes a parallel variable and returns 0 for the largest value, 1 for the next largest value, etc. Applying this routine to Doc_score yields the ranked documents directly. If the number of hits returned is much less than the number of documents in the collection (k ´ JV), the global ranking function performs more work than necessary. An alternative is for the retrieval system to use the global maximum routine in an iterative process of identification and extraction. During each iteration, the system applies the global maximum routine to Doc_score to identify the current top ranked document. The document is added to the hit-list and its score in Doc_score is set to ó 1. After k iterations, the top k hits will have been entered on the hit-list. The techniques just described assume that the entire signature file fits in main memory. If this is not the case, additional steps must be taken to process the entire document collection. A straightforward approach is to process the collection in batches. A batch consists of as many document signatures as will fit in main memory at one time. Each batch is read into memory and scored using one of the above algorithms. The intermediate results are saved in an array of document scores. After all batches have been processed, the array of document scores is ranked and the final hit-list is generated. In general, processing the collection in batches performs poorly due to the I/O required to read in each batch. The performance penalty imposed by the I/O can be reduced by processing multiple queries on each batch, such that the I/O costs are amortized over multiple queries. This helps query processing throughput, but does nothing to improve query processing response time. An alternative to processing in batches is to use a parallel hit-sliced sig-nature file, proposed by Panagopoulos and Faloutsos [627] (see Chapter 8). 244        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR docs 0 110 11 10 0 10 0 1110 10 0 10 0 0 0 rfoc5     110    0    0     1 Figure 9.8    Document signatures. Figure 9.8 shows a matrix representation of the signatures for a small document collection (N = 5). In a traditional signature file, each row of the matrix, or document signature, is stored contiguously. In a bit-sliced signature file, each column of the matrix, or bit-slice, is stored contiguously. A bit-slice is a vertical slice through the matrix, such that bit-slice i contains the i-th bit from every document signature. With this organization, the retrieval system can load just those bit-slices required by the query terms in question. Note that the file offset of bit-slice i (starting with 0) is z*iV bits, and the length of each bit-slice is iV bits. When using a bit-sliced signature file, each virtual processor is still responsible for scoring a single document. A virtual processor's local memory is used to store the bits from each bit-slice that correspond to the processor's document. A bit-slice, therefore, is distributed across the virtual processors with one bit at each processor. The set of bits across the virtual processors that corresponds to a single bit-slice is called a frame. The total number of frames is F = M/N, where M is the size of memory in bits available for storing bit-slices. When F lt; W (W is the number of bit-slices in the file), the system employs a frame replacement policy to determine which bit-slices must be resident to process the query. The frame replacement policy may simply fetch all of the bit-slices that correspond to the query terms, or it may analyze the query and identify a subset of bit-slices that, when evaluated, still provides an acceptably low false drop probability. To search the bit-sliced signature file, we must make a few modifications to our basic query processing procedures. First, the frame replacement routine must be run at the start of processing a query to insure that the required bit-slices are resident. Second, the signature hash functions must be updated to return a frame index rather than a signature bit index. The frame index is the index of the frame that contains the bit-slice corresponding to the previously computed signature bit index. Finally, the parallel bit array, Doc_sig, passed into probe^doc is replaced with the parallel bit array Frames, which provides eacii virtual processor access to its frames. Panagopoulos and Faloutsos [627] analyze the performance of the parallel bit-sliced signature file and show that query response times of under 2 seconds can be achieved on a 128 Gb database on the CM-2. Although this technique addresses the issue of query response time on large document collections, it defeats one of the often claimed advantages of the signature file organization, namely, that indexing new documents is straightforward. In a traditional signature file PARALLEL IR        245 organization, new document signatures may simply be appended to the signature file. With a bit-sliced signature file, the signature file must be inverted, resulting in update costs similar to that of an inverted file. inverted Files While the adaptation of signature file techniques to SIMD architectures is rather natural, inverted files are somewhat awkward to implement on SIMD machines. Nevertheless, Stanfill et al. [744, 740] have proposed two adaptations of inverted files for the CM-2. Recall from Chapter 8 the structure of an inverted list. In its simplest form, an inverted list contains a posting for each document in which the associated term appears. A posting is a tuple of the form (^, dj), where kz is a term identifier and dj is a document identifier. Depending on the retrieval model, postings may additionally contain weights or positional information. If positional information is stored, then a posting is created for each occurrence of k7 in dj. The first parallel inverted file implementation for the CM-2 uses two data structures to store the inverted file: a postings table and an index. The postings table contains the document identifiers from the postings and the index maps terms to their corresponding entries in the postings table. Before the postings are loaded into these structures, they are sorted by term identifier. The document identifiers are then loaded into the postings table in this sorted order, filling in a series of rows of length P, where P is the number of processors in use. The postings table is treated as a parallel array, where the array subscript selects a particular row, and each row is spread across the P processors. For each term, the index stores the locations of the first and last entries in the postings table for the set of document identifiers associated with the term. Figure 9.9 shows a small document collection, the raw postings, and the resulting postings table and index. For example, to find the documents that contain the term "piggy/ we look up 'piggy' in the index and determine that the postings table entries from row 1, position 3, to row 2, position 1, contain the corresponding document identifiers, or 0, 1, and 2. At search time these data structures are used to rank documents as follows. First, the retrieval system loads the postings table onto the back-end processors. Next, the system iterates over the query terms. For each query term, an index lookup returns the range of postings table entries that must be processed. The search system then iterates over the rows included in this range. For each row, the processors that contain entries for the current term are activated and the associated document identifiers are used to update the scores of the corresponding documents. Document scores are built up in accumulators (called mailboxes by Stanfill), which are allocated in a parallel array similar to the postings table. To update the accumulator for a particular document, we must determine the accumulator's row and position within the row. For convenience, well assume that this information (rather than document identifiers) is stored in the postings table. Furthermore, 246        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR Documents This   little  piggy went to market. This  little  piggy stayed home. This  little   piggy had roast beef.

The complete algorithm for scoring a weighted term is showTn in Figure 9.10. The score_term routine assumes that the index lookup for the query term has been done and the results were stored in term. The routine iterates over each row of postings associated with the term and determines which positions to process within the current row. Position is a parallel integer constant where the first instance contains 0, the second instance contains 1, etc., and the last instance contains N-PROCS ó 1. It is used in the where clause to activate the appropriate processors based on the positions of interest in the current row. The left-indexing performed on Doc.score at the end of the routine provides access to a particular instance of the parallel variable. This operation is significant because it involves communication between the processors. Posting weights must be shipped from the processor containing the posting to the processor containing the accumulator for the corresponding document. After the system has processed all of the query terms with score_term, it ranks the documents based on their scores and returns the top k documents. It is expensive to send posting weights to accumulators on different processors. To address this problem, Stanfill [740] proposed the partitioned postings PARALLEL IR        247 score_term  (P_float Doc_score[],  P_posting PostingG, term_t term) { int         i; int         first_pos; int         last_pos; P_int      Doc_row; P_int      Doc_pos; P.float Weight; for   (i = term.first_row;   i  lt;= term.last_row; first_pos =  (i === term.first_row ? term.first_pos   :   0); last_pos =  (i == term.last_row ? term.last_pos   :   N_PR0CS  -1); where   (Position gt;= first_pos  Position lt;= last.pos)   -C Doc_row = Posting[i].row; Doc_pos = Posting[i].pos; Weight = term.weight  * Posting[i].weight; [Doc_pos]Doc_score[Doc_row]   += Weight; Figure 9.10    score_term. file, which eliminates the communication required in the previous algorithm by storing the postings and accumulator for a given document on the same processor. There are two tricks to accomplishing this. First, as the postings are loaded into the postings table, rather than working left to right across the rows and filling each row before starting with the next one, the postings are added to the column that corresponds to the processor where the associated document will be scored. This ensures that all of the postings associated with a document will be loaded onto the same processor as the document's accumulator. Figure 9.11 (a) shows how the postings from Figure 9.9 would be loaded into a table for two processors, with documents 0 and 1 assigned to processor 0 and document 2 assigned to processor 1. Figure 9.11(a) also demonstrates a problem with this scheme. The postings for the term this are skewed and no longer span consecutive rows. To handle this situation, we apply the second trick of the partitioned postings file, which is to segment the postings such that every term in segment i is lexicographically less than or equal to every term in segment i 4-1. This is shown in Figure 9.11(b) using segments of three rows. Note how some segments may need to be padded with blank space in order to satisfy the partitioning constraints. 248        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR home	1	beef	2 little	0	had	2 little	1	little	2 market	0	piggy	2 piggy	0	roast	2 piggy	1	this	2 stayed	1 this	0 this	1 to	0 went	0 home 1 little 0 little         1	beef 2 had 2 little      2 market     0 piggy o piggy     i	piggy    2 roast      2 stayed 1 this 0 this          1	this        2 to 0 went         0 (a) (b) Figure 9.11    Skewed and partitioned postings.

The postings table and index undergo a few more modifications before reaching their final form, shown in Figure 9.12. First, term identifiers in the postings are replaced by term tags. The system assigns tags to terms such that no two terms in the same partition share the same tag. Second, document identifiers in the postings are replaced by document row numbers, where the row number Identifies which row contains the accumulator for the document. Since the accumulator is at the same position (i.e., processor) as the posting, the row number is sufficient to identify the document. Finally, the index is modified to record the .starting partition, ending partition, and tag for each term.

The modified term scoring algorithm is shown in Figure 9.13. Here NJLQWS is the number of rows per partition. The algorithm iterates over the rows of postings that span the term's partitions and activates the processors with matching postings. Each active processor extracts the document row from the posting, calculates the term weight, and updates the document's score. After all query terms have been processed, the system ranks the documents and returns the top k. Stanfill [740] shows that the partitioned postings file imposes a space overhead of approximately 1/3 the original text (of which 10-20% is wasted partition padding) and can support sub 2-second query response times on a terabyte of text using a 64K processor CM-2.
mir-0170	9.3.1    Introduction Distributed computing is the application of multiple computers connected by a network to solve a single problem. A distributed computing system can be viewed as a MIMD parallel processor with a relatively slow inter-processor communication channel and the freedom to employ a heterogeneous collection of processors in the system. In fact, a single processing node in the distributed system could be a parallel computer in its own right. Moreover, if they all support the same public interface and protocol for invoking their services, the computers in the system may be owned and operated by different parties. Distributed systems typically consist of a set of server processes, each running on a separate processing node, and a designated broker process responsible 250        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR for accepting client requests, distributing the requests to the servers, collecting intermediate results from the servers, and combining the intermediate results into a final result for the client. This computation model is very similar to the MIMD parallel processing model shown in Figure 9.2. The main difference here is that the subtasks run on different computers and the communication between the subtasks is performed using a network protocol such as TCP/IP [176] (rather than, for example, shared memory-based inter-process communication mechanisms). Another significant difference is that in a distributed system it is more common to employ a procedure for selecting a subset of the distributed servers for processing a particular request rather than broadcasting every request to every server in the system. Applications that lend themselves well to a distributed implementation usually involve computation and data that can be split into coarse-grained operations with relatively little communication required between the operations. Parallel information retrieval based on document partitioning fits this profile well. In section 9.2.2 we saw how document partitioning can be used to divide the search task up into multiple, self-contained subtasks that each involve extensive computation and data processing with little communication between them. Moreover, documents are almost always grouped into collections, either for administrative purposes or to combine related documents into a single source. Collections, therefore, provide a natural granularity for distributing data across servers and partitioning the computation. Note that since term partitioning imposes greater communication overhead during query processing, it is rarely employed in a distributed system. To build a distributed IR system, we need to consider both engineering issues common to many distributed systems and algorithmic issues specific to information retrieval. The critical engineering issues involve defining a search protocol for transmitting requests and results; designing a server that can efficiently accept a request, initiate a subprocess or thread to service the request, and exploit any locality inherent in the processing using appropriate caching techniques; and designing a broker that can submit asynchronous search requests to multiple servers in parallel and combine the intermediate results into a final end user response. The algorithmic issues include how to distribute documents across the distributed search servers, how to select which servers should receive a particular search request, and how to combine the results from the different servers. The search protocol specifies the syntax and semantics of messages transmitted between clients and servers, the SÄaquence of messages required to establish a connection and carry out a search operation, and the underlying transport mechanism for sending messages (e.g., TCP/IP). At a minimum, the protocol should allow a client to: obtain information about a search server, e.g., a list of databases available for searching at the server and possibly statistics associated with the databases; DISTRIBUTED IR        251 Æ submit a search request for one or more databases using a well defined query language; Æ receive search results in a well denned format; ï retrieve items identified in the search results. For closed systems consisting of homogeneous search servers, a custom search protocol may be most appropriate, particularly if special functionality (e.g., encryption of requests and results) is required. Alternatively, a standard protocol may be used, allowing the system to interoperate more easily with other search servers. The Z39.50 [606] standard (see Chapter 4) for client/server information retrieval defines a widely used protocol with enough functionality to support most search applications. Another proposed protocol for distributed, heterogeneous search, called STARTS (Stanford Proposal for Internet Meta-Searching) [317], was developed at Stanford University in cooperation with a consortium of search product and service vendors. STARTS was designed from scratch to support distributed information retrieval and includes features intended to solve the algorithmic issues related to distributed IR, such as merging results from heterogeneous sources. The other engineering issues related to building efficient client/server systems have been covered extensively in the literature (see, for example, Comer and Stevens [176] and Zomaya [852]). Rather than review them here, we continue with a more detailed look at the algorithmic issues involved in distributed IR.
mir-0171	9.3.2    Collection Partitioning The procedure used to assign documents to search servers in a distributed IR system depends on a number of factors. First, we must consider whether or not the system is centrally administered. In a system comprising independently administered, heterogeneous search servers, the distributed document collections will be built and maintained independently. In this case, there is no central control of the document partitioning procedure and the question of how to partition the documents is essentially moot. It may be the case, however, that each independent search server is focused on a particular subject area, resulting in a semantic partitioning of the documents into distributed collections focused on particular subject areas. This situation is common in meta search systems that provide centralized access to a variety of back-end search service providers. When the distributed system is centrally administered, more options are available. The first option is simple replication of the collection across all of the search servers. This is appropriate when the collection is small enough to fit on a single search server, but high availability and query processing throughput are required. In this scenario, the parallelism in the system is being exploited via multitasking (see Figure 9.1) and the broker's job is to route queries to the search servers and balance the loads on the servers. 252        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR Indexing the documents is handled in one of two ways. In the first method, each search server separately indexes its replica of the documents. In the second method, each server is assigned a mutually exclusive subset of documents to index and the index subsets are replicated across the search servers. A merge of the subsets is required at each search server to create the final indexes (which can be accomplished using the technique described under Document Partitioning in section 9.2.2). In either case, document updates and deletions must be broadcast to all servers in the system. Document additions may be broadcast, or they may be batched and partitioned depending on their frequency and how quickly updates must be reflected by the system. The second option is random distribution of the documents. This is appropriate when a large document collection must be distributed for performance reasons but the documents will always be viewed and searched as if they are part of a single, logical collection. The broker broadcasts every query to all of the search servers and combines the results for the user. The final option is explicit semantic partitioning of the documents. Here the documents are either already organized into semantically meaningful collections, such as by technical discipline, or an automatic clustering or categorization procedure is used to partition the documents into subject specific collections.
mir-0172	9.3.3    Source Selection Source selection is the process of determining which of the distributed document collections are most likely to contain relevant documents for the current query, and therefore should receive the query for processing. One approach is to always assume that every collection is equally likely to contain relevant documents and simply broadcast the query to all collections. This approach is appropriate when documents are randomly partitioned or there is significant semantic overlap between the collections. When document collections are partitioned into semantically meaningful collections or it is prohibitively expensive to search every collection every time, the collections can be ranked according to their likelihood of containing relevant documents. The basic technique is to treat each collection as if it were a single large document, index the collections, and evaluate the query against the collections to produce a ranked listing of collections. We can apply a standard cosine similarity measure using a query vector and collection vectors. To calculate a term weight in the collection vector using tf-idf style weighting (see Chapter 2), term frequency tf-hJ is the total number of occurrences of term i in collection j, and the inverse document frequency idft for term i is log(JV/nj), where N is the total number of collections and nt is the number of collections in which terin i appears. A danger of this approach is that although a particular collection may receive a high query relevance score, there may not be individual documents within the collection that receive a high query relevance score, essentially resulting in a false drop and unnecessary work to score the collection. Moffat and Zobel [574] DISTRIBUTED IR        253 propose avoiding this problem by indexing each collection as a series of blocks, where each block contains B documents. When B equals 1, this is equivalent to indexing all of the documents as a single, monolithic collection. When B equals the number of documents in each collection, this is equivalent to the original solution. By varying £?, a tradeoff is made between collection index size and likelihood of false drops. An alternative to searching a collection index was proposed by Voorhees [792], who proposes using training queries to build a content model for the distributed collections. When a new query is submitted to the system, its similarity to the training queries is computed and the content model is used to determine which collections should be searched and how many hits from each collection should be returned.
mir-0173	9.3.4    Query Processing Query processing in a distributed IR system proceeds as follows: (1)  Select collections to search. (2)  Distribute query to selected collections. (3)  Evaluate query at distributed collections in parallel. (4)  Combine results from distributed collections into final result. As described in the previous section, Step 1 may be eliminated if the query is always broadcast to every document collection in the system. Otherwise, one of the previously described selection algorithms is used and the query is distributed to the selected collections. Each of the participating search servers then evaluates the query on the selected collections using its own local search algorithm. Finally, the results are merged. At this point we have covered everything except how to merge the results. There are a number of scenarios. First, if the query is Boolean and the search servers return Boolean result sets, all of the sets are simply unioned to create the final result set. If the query involves free-text ranking, a number of techniques are available ranging from simple/naive to complex/accurate. The simplest approach is to combine the ranked hit-lists using round robin interleaving. This is likely to produce poor quality results since hits from irrelevant collections are given status equal to that of hits from highly relevant collections. An improvement on this process is to merge the hit-lists based on relevance score. As with the parallel process described for Document Partitioning in section 9.2.2, unless proper global term statistics are used to compute the document scores, we may get incorrect results. If documents are randomly distributed such that global term statistics are consistent across all of the distributed collections, the merging based on relevance score is sufficient to maintain retrieval effectiveness. If, however, the distributed document collections are 254        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR semantically partitioned or maintained by independent parties, then reranking must be performed. Callan [139] proposes reranking documents by weighting document scores based on their collection similarity computed during the source selection step. The weight for a collection is computed as w = 1+ | C \ -(s ó s)/s, where | C | is the number of collections searched, s is the collection's score, and s is the mean of the collection scores. The most accurate technique for merging ranked hit-lists is to use accurate global term statistics. This can be accomplished in one of a variety of ways. First, if the collections have been indexed for source selection, that index will contain global term statistics across all of the distributed collections. The broker can include these statistics in the query when it distributes the query to the remote search servers. The servers can then account for these statistics in their processing and produce relevance scores that can be merged directly. If a collection index is unavailable, query distribution can proceed in two rounds of communication. In the first round, the broker distributes the query and gathers collection statistics from each of the search servers. These statistics are combined by the broker and distributed back to the search servers in the second round. Finally, the search protocol can require that search servers return global query term statistics and per-document query term statistics [317, 441]. The broker is then free to rerank every document using the query term statistics and a ranking algorithm of its choice. The end result is a hit-list that contains documents from the distributed collections ranked in the same order as if all of the documents had been indexed in a single collection.
mir-0174	9.3.5    Web Issues Information retrieval on the World Wide Web is covered extensively in Chapter 13. For completeness, we briefly mention here how parallel and distributed information retrieval applies to the Web. The most direct application is to gather all of the documents on the Web into a single, large document collection. The parallel and distributed techniques described above can then be used directly as if the Web were any other large document collection. This is the approach currently taken by most of the popular Web search services. Alternatively, we can exploit the distributed system of computers that make up the Web and spread the work of collecting, organizing, and searching all of the documents. This is the approach taken by the Harvest system [108]. Harvest comprises a number of components for gathering, summarizing, replicating, distributing, and searching documents. User queries are processed by brokers, which collect and refine information from gatherers and other brokers. The information at a particular broker is typically related to a restricted set of topics, allowing users to direct their queries to the most appropriate brokers. A central broker registry helps users find the best brokers for their queries (see Figure 13.4). TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        255
mir-0175	9.4    Trends and Research Issues Parallel computing holds great potential for tackling the performance and scale issues associated with the large and growing document collections currently available online. In this chapter we have surveyed a number of techniques for exploiting modern parallel architectures. The trend in parallel hardware is the development of general MIMD machines. Coincident with this trend is the availability of features in modern programming languages, such as threads and associated synchronization constructs, that greatly facilitate the task of developing programs for these architectures. In spite of this trend, research in parallel IR algorithms on MIMD machines is relatively young, with few standard results to draw on. Much of the early work in parallel IR was aimed at supporting signature files on SIMD architectures. Although SIMD machines are well suited to processing signature files, both SIMD machines and signature files have fallen out of favor in their respective communities. SIMD machines are difficult to program and are well suited to a relatively small class of problems. As Chapter 8 points out, signature files provide poor support for document ranking and hold few, if any, advantages over inverted files in terms of functionality, index size, and processing speed [851]. Distributed computing can be viewed as a form of MIMD computing with relatively high interprocessor communication costs. Most of the parallel IR algorithms discussed in this chapter, however, have a high ratio of computation to communication, and are well suited to both symmetric multiprocessor and distributed implementations. In fact, by using an appropriate abstraction layer for inter-process communication, we can easily implement a parallel system that works well on both multiprocessor and distributed architectures with relatively little modification. Many challenges remain in the area of parallel and distributed text retrieval. While we have presented a number of approaches in this chapter, none stand out as the definitive solution for building parallel or distributed information retrieval systems. In addition to the continued development and investigation of parallel indexing and search techniques for systems based on inverted files and suffix arrays, two specific challenges stand out. The first challenge is measuring retrieval effectiveness on large text collections. Although we can easily measure the speedup achieved by a given parallel system, measuring the quality of the results produced by that system is another story. This challenge, of course, is not unique to parallel IR systems. Large collections pose problems particularly when it comes to generating relevance judgments for queries. The pooling techniques used in TREC (see Chapter 3) may not work. There, ranked result lists are combined from multiple systems to produce a relatively small set of documents for human evaluation. The assumption is that most, if not all, of the relevant documents will be included in the pool. With large collections, this assumption may not hold. Moreover, it is unclear how important recall is in this context. The second significant challenge is interoperability, or building distributed IR systems from heterogeneous components. The need for distributed systems 256        PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED IR comprising heterogeneous back-end search servers is clear from the popularity of meta search services on the Web. The functionality of these systems is limited, however, due to the lack of term statistics from the back-end search servers, which would otherwise allow for accurate reranking and result list merging. Moreover, each search server employs its own, custom query language, opening up the possibility that the original intent of the query is lost when it is translated to the back-end query languages. Protocol standardization efforts, such as STARTS [317], attempt to address these problems, but commitment to these standards by the entire community of search providers is required.
mir-0176	9.5    Bibliographic Discussion A thorough overview of parallel and distributed computing can be found in the Parallel and Distributed Computing Handbook [852], edited by Albert Zomaya. Many interesting research papers specific to parallel and distributed information systems can be found in the proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems. Stanfill et al [742, 744, 740] are responsible for much of the early work using massively parallel hardware (in particular, the Thinking Machines Connection Machine) to solve IR problems. Pogue and Willet [645] also explored massively parallel IR using the ICL Distributed Array Processor. Salton and Buckley [701] provide some interesting comments on the early implementations of parallel IR, challenging both their speed and effectiveness. Lu et al [524] analyze how to properly scale SMP hardware for parallel IR and emphasize the importance of proper hardware balance. Investigations into parallel and distributed inverted file implementations have been performed by Tomasic and Garcia-Molina [762, 763, 764], Jeong and Omiecinski [404], and Ribeiro-Neto and Barbosa [673]. Parallel and distributed algorithms for suffix array construction and search have been explored by Navarro et al. [591]. Given P processors and total text of size n, they obtain average indexing times that are O(n/P logn) CPU time and 0{n/P) communication time. Macleod et al [535] offer a number of strategies and tips for building distributed information retrieval systems. Cahoon and McKinley [137] analyze the performance of the Inquery distributed information retrieval system. Source selection and collection fusion issues have been investigated by Gra-vano et al using the G1OSS system [318], Voorhees et al [792], Callan et al [139], Moffat arid Zobel [574], Viles and French [787], and others.

mir-0178	10.1    Introduction This chapter discusses user interfaces for communication between human information seekers and information retrieval systems. Information seeking is an imprecise process. When users approach an information access system they often have only a fuzzy understanding of how they can achieve their goals. Thus the user interface should aid in the understanding and expression of information needs. It should also help users formulate their queries, select among available information sources, understand search results, and keep track of the progress of their search. The human-computer interface is less well understood than other aspects of information retrieval, in part because humans are more complex than computer systems, and their motivations and behaviors are more difficult to measure and characterize. The area is also undergoing rapid change, and so the discussion in this chapter will emphasize recent developments rather than established wisdom. The chapter will first outline the human side of the information seeking process and then focus on the aspects of this process that can best be supported by the user interface. Discussion will encompass current practice and technology, recently proposed innovative ideas, and suggestions for future areas of development. Section 10.2 outlines design principles for human-computer interaction and introduces notions related to information visualization, section 10.3 describes information seeking models, past and present. The next four sections describe user interface support for starting the search process, for query specification, for viewing retrieval results in context, and for interactive relevance feedback. The last major section, section 10.8, describes user interface techniques to support the information access process as a whole. Section 10.9 speculates on future developments and Section 10.10 provides suggestions for further reading. Figure 10.1 presents the flow of the chapter contents. 257 258        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Introduction HCI Background The Information Access Process Starting Points Query Specification Context Using Relevance Judgements Interface Support 4 Conclusions Figure 10.1     The flow of this chapter's contents.
mir-0179	10.2    Human-Computer Interaction What makes an effective human-computer interface? Ben Shneiderman, an expert in the field, writes [725, p. 10]: Well designed, effective computer systems generate positive feelings of success, competence, mastery, and clarity in the user community. When an interactive system is well-designed, the interface almost disappears, enabling users to concentrate on their work, exploration, or pleasure. As steps towards achieving these goals, Shneiderman lists principles for design of user interfaces. Those which are particularly important for information access include (slightly restated): provide informative feedback, permit easy reversal of actions, support an internal locus of control, reduce working memory load, and provide alternative interfaces for novice and expert users. Each of these principles should be instantiated differently depending on the particular interface application.  Below we discuss those principles that are of special interest to information access systems.
mir-0180	10.2.1    Design Principles Offer informative feedback This principle is especially important for information access interfaces. In this chapter we will see current ideas about how to provide HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION        259 users with feedback about the relationship between their query specification and documents retrieved, about relationships among retrieved documents, and about relationships between retrieved documents and metadata describing collections. If the user has control of how and when feedback is provided, then the system provides an internal locus of control Reduce working memory load. Information access is an iterative process, the goals of which shift and change as information is encountered. One key way information access interfaces can help with memory load is to provide mechanisms for keeping track of choices made during the search process, allowing users to return to temporarily abandoned strategies, jump from one strategy to the next, and retain information and context across search sessions. Another memory-aiding device is to provide browsable information that is relevant to the current stage of the information access process. This includes suggestions of related terms or metadata, and search starting points including lists of sources and topic lists. Provide alternative interfaces for novice and expert users. An important tradeoff in all user interface design is that of simplicity versus power. Simple interfaces are easier to learn, at the expense of less flexibility and sometimes less efficient use. Powerful interfaces allow a knowledgeable user to do more and have more control over the operation of the interface, but can be time-consuming to learn and impose a memory burden on people who use the system only intermittently. A common solution is to use a 'scaffolding' technique [684]. The novice user is presented with a simple interface that can be learned quickly and that provides the basic functionality of the application, but is restricted in power and flexibility. Alternative interfaces are offered for more experienced users, giving them more control, more options, and more features, or potentially even entirely different interaction models. Good user interface design provides intuitive bridges between the simple and the advanced interfaces. Information access interfaces must contend with special kinds of simplicity/power tradeoffs. One such tradeoff is the amount of information shown about the workings of the search system itself. Users who are new to a system or to a particular collection may not know enough about the system or the domain associated with the collection to make choices among complex features. They may not know how best to weight terms, or in the case of relevance feedback, not know what the effects of reweighting terms would be. On the other hand, users that have worked with a system and gotten a feeling for a topic are likely to be able to choose among suggested terms to add to their query in an informed manner. Determining how much information to show the user of the system is a major design choice in information access interfaces.
mir-0181	10.2.2    The Role of Visualization The tools of computer interface design are familiar to most computer users today: windows, menus, icons, dialog boxes, and so on. These make use of bitmapped display and computer graphics to provide a oiore accessible Interface 260        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION than command-line-based displays. A less familiar but growing area is that of information visualization, which attempts to provide visual depictions of very large information spaces. Humans are highly attuned to images and visual information [769, 456, 483]. Pictures and graphics can be captivating and appealing, especially if well designed. A visual representation can communicate some kinds of information much more rapidly and effectively than any other method. Consider the difference between a written description of a person's face and a photograph of it, or the difference between a table of numbers containing a correlation and a scatter plot showing the same information. The growing prevalence of fast graphics processors and high resolution color monitors is increasing interest in information visualization. Scientific visualization, a rapidly advancing branch of this field, maps physical phenomena onto two- or three-dimensional representations [433]. An example of scientific visualization is a colorful image of the pattern of peaks and valleys on the ocean floor; this provides a view of physical phenomena for which a photograph cannot (currently) be taken. Instead, the image is constructed from data that represent the underlying phenomena. Visualization of inherently abstract information is more difficult, and visualization of textually represented information is especially challenging. Language is our main means of communicating abstract ideas for which there is no obvious physical manifestation. What does a picture look like that describes negotiations over a trade agreement in which one party demands concessions on environmental policies while the other requires help in strengthening its currency? Despite the difficulties, researchers are attempting to represent aspects of the information access process using information visualization techniques. Some of these will be described later in this chapter. Aside from using icons and color highlighting, the main information visualization techniques include brushing and Unking [233, 773], panning and zooming [71], focus-plus-context [502], magic leimts [95], and the use of animation to retain context and help make occluded information visible [676, 143]. These techniques support dynamic, interactive use. Interactivity seems to be an especially important property for visualizing abstract information, although it has not played as large a role within scientific visualization. Brushing and linking refers to the connecting of two or more views of the same data, such that a change to the representation in one view affects the representation in the other views as well. For example, say a display consists of two parts: a histogram and a list of titles. The histogram shows, for a set of documents, how many documents were published each year. The title list shows the titles for the corresponding documents. Brushing and linking would allow the user to assign a color, say red, to one bar of the histogram, thus causing the titles in the list display that were published during the corresponding year to also be highlighted in red. Panning and zooming refers to the actions of a movie camera that can scan sideways across a scene (panning) or move in for a closeup or back away to get a wider view (zooming).   For example, text clustering can be used to show a HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION        261 top-level view of the main themes in a document collection (see Figures 10.7 and 10.8). Zooming can be used to move 'closer,' showing individual documents as icons, and then zoom in closer still to see the text associated with an individual document. When zooming is used, the more detail that is visible about a particular item, the less can be seen about the surrounding items. Focus-plus-context is used to partly alleviate this effect. The idea is to make one portion of the view ó the focus of attention ó larger, while simultaneously shrinking the surrounding objects. The farther an object is from the focus of attention, the smaller it is made to appear, like the effect seen in a fisheye camera lens (also in some door peepholes). Magic lenses are directly manipulable transparent windows that, when overlapped on some other data type, cause a transformation to be applied to the underlying data, thus changing its appearance (see Figure 10.13). The most straightforward application of magic lenses is for drawing tasks, and it is especially useful if used as a two-handed interface. For example, the left hand can be used to position a color lens over a drawing of an object. The right hand is used to mouse-click on the lens, thus causing the appearance of the underlying object to be transformed to the color specified by the lens. Additionally, there are a large number of graphical methods for depicting trees and hierarchies, some of which make use of animation to show nodes that would otherwise be occluded (hidden from view by other nodes) [286, 364, 407, 478, 676]. It is often useful to combine these techniques into an interface layout consisting of an overview plus details [321, 644]. An overview, such as a table-of-contents of a large manual, is shown in one window. A mouse-click on the title of the chapter causes the text of the chapter itself to appear in another window, in a linking action (see Figure 10.19). Panning and zooming or focus-plus-context can be used to change the view of the contents within the overview window.
mir-0182	10.2.3    Evaluating Interactive Systems From the viewpoint of user interface design, people have widely differing abilities, preferences, and predilections. Important differences for information access interfaces include relative spatial ability and memory, reasoning abilities, verbal aptitude, and (potentially) personality differences [227, 725]. Age and cultural differences can contribute to acceptance or rejection of interface techniques [557]. An interface innovation can be useful and pleasing for some users, and foreign and cumbersome for others. Thus software design should allow for flexibility in interaction style, and new features should not be expected to be equally helpful for all users. An important aspect of human-computer interaction is the methodology for evaluation of user interface techniques. Precision and recall measures have been widely used for comparing the ranking results of non-Interactive systems, but are less appropriate for assessing interactive systems [470]. The standard evaluations 262        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION emphasize high recall levels; in the TREC tasks systems are compared to see how well they return the top 1000 documents (see chapter 3). However, in many interactive settings, users require only a few relevant documents and do not care about high recall to evaluate highly interactive information access systems, useful metrics beyond precision and recall include: time required to learn the system, time required to achieve goals on benchmark tasks, error rates, and retention of the use of the interface over time. Throughout this chapter, empirical results of user studies are presented whenever they are available. Empirical data involving human users is time consuming to gather and difficult to draw conclusions from. This is due in part to variation in users' characteristics and motivations, and in part to the broad scope of information access activities. Formal psychological studies usually only uncover narrow conclusions within restricted contexts. For example, quantities such as the length of time it takes for a user to select an item from a fixed menu under various conditions have been characterized empirically [142], but variations in interaction behavior for complex tasks like information access are difficult to account for accurately. Nielsen [605] advocates a more informal evaluation approach (called heuristic evaluation) in which user interface affordances are assessed in terms of more general properties and without concern about statistically significant results.
mir-0183	10.3    The Information Access Process A person engaged in an information seeking process has one or more goals in mind and uses a search system as a tool to help achieve those goals. Goals requiring information access can range quite widely, from finding a plumber to keeping informed about a business competitor, from writing a publishable scholarly article to investigating an allegation of fraud. Information access tasks are used to achieve these goals. These tasks span the spectrum from asking specific questions to exhaustively researching a topic. Other tasks fall between these two extremes. A study of business analysts [614] found three main kinds of information seeking tasks: monitoring a well known topic over time (such as researching competitors' activities each quarter), following a plan or stereotyped series of searches to achieve a particular goal (such as keeping up to date on good business practices), and exploring a topic in an undirected fashion (m when getting to know an unfamiliar industry). Although the goals differ, there is a common core revolving around the information seeking component, which is our focus here.
mir-0184	10.3.1    Models of interaction Most accounts of the information access process assume an interaction cycle consisting of query specification, receipt and examination of retrieval results, and then either stopping or reformulating the query and repeating the process THE INFORMATION ACCESS PROCESS        263 until a perfect result set is found [700, 726]. In more detail, the standard process can be described according to the following sequence of steps (see Figure 10.2): (1)  Start with an information need. (2)  Select a system and collections to search on. (3)  Formulate a query. (4)  Send the query to the system. (5)  Receive the results in the form of information items. (6)  Scan, evaluate, and interpret the results. (7)  Either stop, or, (8)  Reformulate the query and go to step 4. This simple interaction model (used by Web search engines) is the only model that most information seekers see today. This model does not take into account the fact that many users dislike being confronted with a long disorganized list of retrieval results that do not directly address their information needs. It also contains an underlying assumption that the user's information need is static and the information seeking process is one of successively refining a query until it retrieves all and only those documents relevant to the original information need. Information Need Query Send to System Reformulate Receive Results Evaluate Results No ^ Done? \ Stop Figure 10.2 processes. A simplified diagram of the standard model of the information access 264        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION In actuality, users learn during the search process. They scan information, read the titles in result sets, read the retrieved documents themselves, viewing lists of topics related to their query terms, and navigating within hyperlinked Web sites. The recent advent of hyperlinks as a pivotal part of the information seeking process makes it no longer feasible to ignore the role of scanning and navigation within the search process itself. In particular, today a near-miss is much more acceptable than it was with bibliographic search, since an information seeker using the Web can navigate hyperlinks from a near-miss in the hopes that a useful page will be a few links away. The standard model also downplays the interaction that takes place when the user scans terms suggested as a result of relevance feedback, scans thesaurus structures, or views thematic overviews of document collections. It de-emphasizes the role of source selection, which is increasingly important now that, for the first time, tens of thousands of information collections are immediately reachable for millions of people. Thus, while useful for describing the basics of information access systems, this simple interaction model is being challenged on many fronts [65, 614, 105, 365, 192]. Bates [65] proposes the 'berry-picking' model of information seeking, which has two main points. The first is that, as a result of reading and learning from the information encountered throughout the search process, the users' information needs, and consequently their queries, continually shift. Information encountered at one point in a search may lead in a new, unanticipated direction. The original goal may become partly fulfilled, thus lowering the priority of one goal in favor of another. This is posed in contrast to the assumption of 'standard' information retrieval that the user's information need remains the same throughout the search process. The second point is that users' information needs are not satisfied by a single, final retrieved set of documents, but rather by a series of selections and bits of information found along the way. This is in contrast to the assumption that the main goal of the search process is to hone down the set of retrieved documents into a perfect match of the original information need. The berry-picking model is supported by a number of observational studies [236, 105], including that of O'Day and Jeffries [614]. They found that the information seeking process consisted of a series of interconnected but diverse searches on one problem-based theme. They also found that search results for a goal tended to trigger new goals, and hence search in new directions, but that the context of the problem and the previous searches was carried from one stage of search to the next. They also found that the main value of the search resided in the accumulated learning and acquisition of information that occurred during the search process, rather than in the final results set. Thus, a user interface for information access should allow users to reassess their goals and adjust their search strategy accordingly. A related situation occurs when users encounter a 'trigger' that causes them to pursue a different strategy temporarily, perhaps to return to the current unfinished activity at a later time. An implication of these observations is that the user interface should support search strategies by making it easy to follow trails with unanticipated results. This can be accomplished in part by supplying ways to record the progress THE INFORMATION ACCESS PROCESS        265 of the current strategy and to store, find, and reload intermediate results, and by supporting pursuit of multiple strategies simultaneously. The user interface should also support methods for monitoring the status of the current strategy in relation to the user's current task and high-level goals. One way to cast the activity of monitoring the progress of a search strategy relative to a goal or subgoal is in terms of a cost/benefit analysis, or an analysis of diminishing returns [690]. This kind of analysis assumes that at any point in the search process, the user is pursuing the strategy that has the highest expected utility. If, as a consequence of some local tactical choices, another strategy presents itself as being of higher utility than the current one, the current one is (temporarily or permanently) abandoned in favor of the new strategy. There are a number of theories and frameworks that contrast browsing, querying, navigating, and scanning along several dimensions [75, 159, 542, 804]. Here we assume that users scan information structure, be it titles, thesaurus terms, hyperlinks, category labels, or the results of clustering, and then either select a displayed item for some purpose (to read in detail, to use as input to a query, to navigate to a new page of information) or formulate a query (either by recalling potential words or by selecting categories or suggested terms that have been scanned). In both cases, a new set of information is then made viewable for scanning. Queries tend to produce new, ad hoc collections of information that have not been gathered together before, whereas selection retrieves information that has already been composed or organized. Navigation refers to following a chain of links, switching from one view to another, toward some goal, in a sequence of scan and select operations. Browsing refers to the casual, mainly undirected exploration of information structures, and is usually done in tandem with selection, although queries can also be used to create subcollections to browse through. An important aspect of the interaction process is that the output of one action should be easily used as the input to the next.
mir-0185	10.3.2    Non-Search Parts of the Information Access Process The O'Day and Jeffries study [614] found that information seeking is only one part of the full work process their subjects were engaged in. In between searching sessions many different kinds of work was done with the retrieved information, including reading and annotating [617] and analysis. O'Day and Jeffries examined the analysis steps in more detail, finding that 80% of this work fell into six main types: finding trends, making comparisons, aggregating information, identifying a critical subset, assessing, and interpreting. The remaining 20% consisted of cross-referencing, summarizing, finding evocative visualizations for reports, and miscellaneous activities. The Sensemaking work of Russell et al. [690] also discusses information work as a process in which information retrieval plays only a small part. They observe that most of the effort made in Sensemaking is in the synthesis of a good representation, or ways of thinking about, the problem at hand. They describe the process of formulating and crystallizing the important concepts for a given task. 266        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION From these observations it is convenient to divide the entire information access process into two main components: search/retrieval, and analysis /synthesis of results. User interfaces should allow both kinds of activity to be tightly interwoven, However, analysis/synthesis are activities that can be done independently of information seeking, and for our purposes it is useful to make a distinction between the two types of activities.
mir-0186	10.3.3    Earlier Interface Studies The bulk of the literature on studies of human-computer information seeking behavior concerns information intermediaries using online systems consisting of bibliographic records (e.g., [546, 707, 104]), sometimes with costs assessed per time unit. Unfortunately, many of the assumptions behind those studies do not reflect the conditions of modern information access [335, 222]. The differences include the following: ï  The text being searched now is often full text rather than bibliographic citations.   Because users have access to full text, rather than document surrogates, it is more likely that simple queries will find relevant answers directly as part of the search process. ï  Modern systems use statistical ranking (which is more effective when abstracts and full text are available than when only titles and citations are available) whereas most studies were performed on Boolean systems. ï  Much of modern searching is done by end users, many new to online searching, rather than professional intermediaries, which were the focus of many of the earlier studies. ï  Tens of thousands of sources are now available online on networked information systems, and many are tightly coupled via hyperlinks, as opposed to being stored in separate collections owned by separate services.   Earlier studies generally used systems in which moving from one collection to another required prior knowledge of the collections and considerable time and effort to switch. A near miss is much more useful in this hyperlinked environment than in earlier systems, since hyperlinks allow users to navigate from the near miss directly to the source containing information of interest. In a card catalog environment, where documents are represented as isolated units, a near miss consists of finding a book in the general area of interest and then going to the bookshelf in the library to look for related books, or obtaining copies of many issues of a journal and scanning for related articles. ï  Finally, most users have access to bit-mapped displays allowing for direct manipulation, or at least form fiUin. Most earlier studies arid bibliographic systems were implemented on TTY displays, which require command-line based syntax and do a poor job of retaining context. STARTING POINTS        267 Despite these significant differences, some general information seeking strategies have been identified that seem to transfer across systems. Additionally, although modern systems have remedied many of the problems of earlier online public access catalogs, they also introduce new problems of their own.
mir-0187	10.4    Starting Points Search interfaces must provide users with good ways to get started. An empty screen or a blank entry form does not provide clues to help a user decide how to start the search process. Users usually do not begin by creating a long, detailed expression of their information need. Studies show that users tend to start out with very short queries, inspect the results, and then modify those queries in an incremental feedback cycle [22]. The initial query can be seen as a kind of 'testing the water' to see what kinds of results are returned and get an idea of how to reformulate the query [804, 65]. Thus, one task of an information access interface is to help users select the sources and collections to search on. For example, there are many different information sources associated with cancer, and there are many different kinds of information a user might like to know about cancer. Guiding the user to the right set of starting points can help with the initial problem formulation. Traditional bibliographic search assumes that the user begins by looking through a list of names of sources and choosing which collections to search on, while Web search engines obliterate the distinctions between sources and plunge the user into the middle of a Web site with little information about the relationship of the search hit to the rest of the collection. In neither case is the interface to the available sources particularly helpful. In this section we will discuss four main types of starting points: lists, overviews, examples, and automated source selection.
mir-0188	10.4.1    Lists of Collections Typical online systems such as LEXIS-NEXIS require users to begin any inquiry with a scan through a long list of source names and guess which ones will be of interest. Usually little information beyond the name of the collection is provided online for these sources (see Figure 10.3). If the user is not satisfied with the results on one collection, they must reissue the query on another collection. Frequent searchers eventually learn a set of sources that axe useful for their domains of interest, either through experience, formal training, or recommendations from friends and colleagues. Often-used sources can be stored on a 'favorites1 list, also known as a bookmark list or a hotlist on the Web. Recent research explores the maintenance of a personalized information profile for users or work groups, based on the kinds of information they've used in the past [277]. However, when users want to search outside their domains of expertise, a list of familiar sources is not sufficient. Professional searchers such as librarians 268        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION % Boolean ] B.

The restricted nature of traditional interfaces to information collections discourages exploration and discovery of new useful sources. However, recently researchers have devised a number of mechanisms to help users understand the contents of collections as a way of getting started in their search.
mir-0189	10.4.2    Overviews Faced with a large set of text collections, how can a user choose which to begin with? One approach is to study an overview of the contents of the collections. An overview can show the topic domains represented within the collections, to help users select or eliminate sources from consideration. An overview can help users get started, directing them into general neighborhoods, after which they can navigate using more detailed descriptions. Shneiderman [724] advocates an interaction model in which the user begins with an overview of the information to be worked with, then pans and zooms to find areas of potential interest, and then view details. The process is repeated as often as necessary. Three types of overviews are discussed in this subsection. The first is display and navigation of large topical category hierarchies associated with the documents of a collection. The second is automatically derived overviews, usually created by unsupervised clustering techniques on the text of documents, that attempt to extract overall characterizing themes from collections. The third type STARTING POINTS        269 of overview is that created by applying a variant of co-citation analysis on connections or links between different entities within a collection. Other kinds of overviews are possible, for example, showing graphical depictions of bookshelves or piles of books [681, 46]. Category or Directory Overviews There exist today many large online text collections to which category labels have been assigned. Traditional online bibliographic systems have for decades assigned subject headings to books and other documents [752]. MEdigital libraryINE, a large collection of biomedical articles, has associated with it Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) consisting of approximately 18,000 categories [523]. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has developed a hierarchy of approximately 1200 category (keyword) labels.f Yahoo! [839], one of the most popular search sites on the World Wide Web, organizes Web pages into a hierarchy consisting of thousands of category labels. The popularity of Yahoo! and other Web directories suggests that hierarchically structured categories are useful starting points for users seeking information on the Web. This popularity may reflect a preference to begin at a logical starting point, such as the home page for a set of information, or it may reflect a desire to avoid having to guess which words will retrieve the desired information. (It may also reflect the fact that directory services attempt to cull out low quality Web sites.) The meanings of category labels differ somewhat among collections. Most are designed to help organize the documents and to aid in query specification. Unfortunately, users of online bibliographic catalogs rarely use the available subject headings [335, 222], Hancock-Beaulieu and Drabenstott and Weller, among others, put much of the blame on poor (command line-based) user interfaces which provide little aid for selecting subject labels and require users to scroll through long alphabetic lists. Even with graphical Web interfaces, finding the appropriate place within a category hierarchy can be a time-consuming task, and once a collection has been found using such a representation, an alternative means is required for searching within the site itself. Most interfaces that depict category hierarchies graphically do so by associating a document directly with the node of the category hierarchy to which it has been assigned. For example, clicking on a category link in Yahoo! brings up a list of documents that have been assigned that category label Conceptually, the document is stored within the category label. When navigating the results of a search in Yahoo!, the user must look through a list of category labels and guess which one is most likely to contain references to the topic of interest. A wrong path requires backing up and trying again, and remembering which pages contain which information. If the desired information is deep in the hierarchy, or t http://www.acm.org/class 270        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Figure 10.4 [453]. The MeSHBrowse interface for viewing category labels hierarchically not available at all, this can be a time-consuming and frustrating process. Because documents are conceptually stored 'inside' categories, users cannot create queries based on combinations of categories using this interface. It is difficult to design a good interface to integrate category selection into query specification, in part because display of category hierarchies takes up large amounts of screen space. For example, Internet Grateful Medt is a Web-based service that allows an integration of search with display and selection of MeSH category labels. After the user types in the name of a potential category label, a long list of choices is shown in a page. To see more information about a given label the user selects a link (e.g., Radiation Injuries). The causes the context of the query to disappear because a new Web page appears showing the ancestors of the term and its immediate descendants. If the user attempts to see the siblings of the parent term (Wounds and Injuries) then a new page appears that changes the context again. Radiation Injuries appears as one of many siblings and its children can no long be seen. To go back to the query, the illustration of the category hierarchy disappears. The MeSHBrowse system [453] allows users to interactively browse a subset of semantically associated links in the MeSH hierarchy. From a given starting point, clicking on a category causes the associated categories to be displayed In a two-dimensional tree representation.

The interface has the space limitations inherent in a two-dimensional hierarchy display and does not provide mechanisms for search over an underlying document collection. See Figure 10.4. The HiBrowse system [646] represents category metadata more efficiently by allowing users to display several different subsets of category metadata simultaneously. The user first selects which attribute type (or facet, as attributes are called in this system) to display. For example, the user may first choose the ïphysical disease' value for the Disease facet. The categories that appear one level below this are shown along with the number of documents that contain each category. The user can then select other attribute types, such as Therapy and Groups (by age). The number of documents that contain attributes from all three types are shown. If the user now selects a refinement of one of the categories, such as the 'child' value for the Groups attribute, then the number of documents that contain all three selected facet types are shown. At the same time, the number of documents containing the subcategories found below 'physical disease" and 'therapy (general)' are updated to reflect this more restricted specification. See Figure 10.5. A problem with the HiBrowse system is that it requires users to navigate through tiie category hierarchy, rather than specify queries directly. In other words, query specification is not tightly coupled with display of category metadata. As a solution to some of these problems, the Cat-a-Cone interface [358' will be described in section 10.8. 272        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Automatically Derived Collection Overviews Many attempts to display overview information have focused on automatically extracting the most common general themes that occur within the collection. These themes are derived via the use of unsupervised analysis methods, usually variants of document clustering. Clustering organizes documents into groups based on similarity to one another; the centroids of the clusters determine the themes in the collections. The Scatter/Gather browsing paradigm [203, 202] clusters documents into topically-coherent groups, and presents descriptive textual summaries to the user. The summaries consist of topical terms that characterize each cluster generally, and a set of typical titles that hint at the contents of the cluster. Informed by the summaries, the user may select a subset of clusters that seem to be of most interest, and recluster their contents. Thus the user can examine the contents of each subcollection at progressively finer granularity of detail. The reclustering is computed on-the-fly; different themes are produced depending on the documents contained in the subcollection to which clustering is applied. The choice of clustering algorithm influences what clusters are produced, but no one algorithm has been shown to be particularly better than the rest when producing the same number of clusters [816]. A user study [640] showed that the use of Scatter/Gather on a large text collection successfully conveys some of the content and structure of the corpus. However, that study also showed that Scatter/Gather without a search facility was less effective than a standard similarity search for finding relevant documents for a query. That is, subjects allowed only to navigate, not to search over, a hierarchical structure of clusters covering the entire collection were less able to find documents relevant to the supplied query than subjects allowed to write queries arid scan through retrieval results. It is possible to integrate Scatter/Gather with conventional search technology by applying clustering on the results of a query to organize the retrieved documents (see Figure 10.6). An offline experiment [359] suggests that clustering may be more effective if used in this manner. The study found that documents relevant to the query tend to fall mainly into one or two out of five clusters, if the clusters are generated from the top-ranked documents retrieved in response to the query. The study also showed that precision and recall were higher within the best cluster than within the retrieval results as a whole. The implication is that a user might save time by looking at the contents of the cluster with the highest proportion of relevant documents and at the same time avoiding those clusters with mainly non-relevant documents. Thus, clustering of retrieval results may be useful for helping direct users to a subset of the retrieval results that contain a large proportion of the relevant documents. General themes do seem to arise from document clustering, but the themes are highly dependent on the makeup of the documents within the clusters [$59, 357]. The unsupervised nature of clustering can result in a display of topics at varying levels of description. For example, clustering a collection of documents about computer science might result in clusters containing documents about STARTING POINTS        273 0  Star-Spstttgtei Banner, The O  Klt;y, Francis Smtt G  FortMcHettiy O  AIiH :     f * / i***i'ª*'´**^^ O  Blimp, Bleat O  Stanwyck, Bartam O  Berle^MMtoit O  2Sutor, Addph J k O star O Galaxy* The O O intostdlar mattar Figure 10.6     Display of Scatter/Gather clustering retrieval results [203]. artificial intelligence, computer theory, computer graphics, computer architecture, programming languages, government, and legal issues. The latter two themes are more general than the others, because they are about topics outside the general scope of computer science. Thus clustering can results in the juxtaposition of very different levels of description within a single display. Scatter/Gather shows a textual representation of document clusters. Researchers have developed several approaches to map documents from their high dimensional representation in document space into a 2D representation in which each document is represented as a small glyph or icon on a map or within an abstract 2D space. The functions for transforming the data into the lower dimensional space differ, but the net effect is that each document is placed at one point in a scatter-plot-like representation of the space. Users are meant to detect themes or clusters in the arrangement of the glyphs. Systems employing such graphical displays include BEAD [156], the Galaxy of News [671], and ThemeScapes [821]. The TherneScapes view imposes a three-dimensional representation on the results of clustering (see Figure 10.7). The layout makes use of "negative space' to help emphasize the areas of concentration where the clusters occur. Other systems display inter-document similarity hierarchically [529, 14], while still others display retrieved documents in networks based on inter-document similarity [262, 761]. Kohonen's feature map algorithm has been use^d to create maps that graphically characterize the overall content of a document collection or subcollection [520, 163] (see Figure 10.8). The regions of the 2D map vary in size and shape corresponding to how frequently documents assigned to the corresponding themes occur within the collection. Regions are characterized by single words or phrases. 274        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Figure 10.7     A three-dimensional overview based on document clustering [821]. and adjacency of regions is meant to reflect semantic relatedriess of the themes within the collection. A cursor moved over a document region causes the titles of the documents most strongly associated with that region to be displayed in a pop-up window. Documents can be associated with more than one region. Evaluations of Graphical Overviews Although intuitively appealing, graphical overviews of large document spaces have yet to be shown to be useful and understandable for users. In fact, evaluations that have been conducted so far provide negative evidence as to their usefulness. One study found that for non-expert users the results of clustering were difficult to use, and that graphical depictions (for example, representing clusters with circles and lines connecting documents) were much harder to use than textual representations (for example, showing titles and topical words, as in Scatter "'Gather,?, because documents' contents are difficult to discern without actually reading some text [443]. Another recent study compared the Kohonen feature map overview representation on a browsing task to that of Yahoo! [163]. For one (if the tasks, subjects were asked to find an interesting" Web page within the entertainment category of Yahoo! and of an organization of the same Web pages into a Ko-lionen map layout.

Eight of these were able to find the same page using Yahoo!. Of the subjects who started with Yahoo!, 14 out of 16 were able to find interesting home pages. However, only two of the 14 were able to find the page in the graphical map display! This is strong evidence against the navigability of the display and certainly suggests that the simple label view provided by Yahoo! is more useful. However, the map display may be more useful if the system is modified to tightly integrate querying with browsing. The subjects did prefer some aspects of the map representation. In particular, some liked the ease of being able to jump from one area to another without having to back up as is required in Yahoo!, and some liked the fact that the maps have varying levels of granularity. The subjects disliked several aspects of the display. The experimenters found that some subjects expressed a desire for a visible hierarchical organization, others wanted an ability to zoom in on a sub-area to get more detail, and some users disliked having to look through the entire map to find a theme, desiring an alphabetical ordering instead. Many found the single-term labels to be misleading, in part because they were ambiguous (one region called 'BILL* was thought to correspond to a person's name rather than count ing money). The authors concluded that tills interface is more appropriate for casual browsing than for search. In general, unsupervised thematic overviews are perhaps must useful for giving users a "gist' of the kinds of information that can be 276        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION found within the document collection, but generally have not been shown to be helpful for use in the information access process. Co-citation Clustering for Overviews Citation analysis has long been recognized as a way to show an overview of the contents of a collection [812]. The main idea is to determine 'centrally-located' documents based on co-citation patterns. There are different ways to determine citation patterns: one method is to measure how often two articles are cited together by a third. Another alternative is to pair articles that cite the same third article. In both cases the assumption is that the paired articles share some commonalities. After a matrix of co-citations is built, documents are clustered based on the similarity of their co-citation patterns. The resulting clusters are interpreted to indicate dominant themes within the collection. Clustering can focus on the authors of the documents rather than the contents, to attempt to identify central authors within a field. This idea has recently been implemented using Web-based documents in the Referral Web project [432]. The idea has also been applied to Web pages, using Web link structure to identify major topical themes among Web pages [485, 639]. A similar idea, but computed a different way, is used to explicitly identify pages that act as good starting points for particular topics (called "authority pages' by Kleinberg [444]).
mir-0190	10.4.3    Examples, Dialogs, and Wizards Another way to help users get started is to start them off with an example of interaction with the system. This technique is also known as retrieval by reformulation. An early version of this idea is embodied in the Rabbit system [818] which provides graphical representations of example database queries.  A general framework for a query is shown to the user who then modifies it to construct a partially complete description of what they want. The system then shows an example of the kind of information available that matches this partial description. For instance, if a user searching a computer products database indicates an interest in disks, an example item is retrieved with its disk descriptors filled in. The user can use or modify the displayed descriptors, and iterate the procedure. The idea of retrieval by reformulation has been developed further and extended to the domains of user interface development [581] and software engineering [669]. The Helgon system [255] is a modern variant of this idea applied to bibliographic database information. In Helgon, users begin by navigating a hierarchy of topics from which they select structured examples, according to their interests. If a feature of an example is inappropriately set, the user can modify the feature to Indicate how it would appear in the desired information. Unfortunately, in tests with users, the system was found to be problematic. Users had problems with the organization of the hierarchy, and found that searching for a useful example by critiquing an existing one to be tedious. This result STARTING POINTS        277 underscores an unfortunate difficulty with examples and dialogues: that of getting the user to the right starting dialogue or the right example strategy becomes a search problem in itself. (How to index prior examples is studied extensively in the case-based reasoning (CBR) literature [492, 449].) A more dynamic variation on this theme is the interactive dialog. Dialog-based interfaces have been explored since the early days of information retrieval research, in an attempt to mimic the interaction provided by a human search intermediary (e.g., a reference librarian). Oddy did early work in the THOMAS system, which provided a question and answer session within a command-line-based interface [615]. More recently, Belkin et al have defined quite elaborate dialog interaction models [75] although these have not been assessed empirically to date. The digital libraryITE system interface [192] uses an animated focus-plus-context dialog as a way to acquaint users with standard sequences of operations within the system. Initially an outline of all of the steps of the dialog is shown as a list. The user can expand the explanation of any individual step by clicking on its description. The user can expand out the entire dialog to see what questions are coming next, and then collapse it again in order to focus on the current tactic. A more restricted form of dialog that has become widely used in commercial products is that of the wizard. This tool helps users in time-limited tasks, but does not attempt to overtly teach the processes required to complete the tasks. The wizard presents a step-by-step shortcut through the sequence of menu choices (or tactics) that a user would normally perform in order to get a job done, reducing user input to just a few choices with default settings [636]. A recent study [145] found wizards to be useful for goals that require many steps, for users who lack necessary domain knowledge (for example, a restaurant owner installing accounting software), and when steps must be completed in a fixed sequence (for example, a procedure for hiring personnel). Properties of successful wizards included allowing users to rerun a wizard and modify their previous work, showing an overview of the supported functions, and providing lucid descriptions and understandable outcomes for choices. Wizards were found not to be helpful when the interface did not solve a problem effectively (for example, a commercial wizard for setting up a desktop search index requests users to specify how large to make the index, but supplies no information about how to make this decision). Wizards were also found not to be helpful when the goal was to teach the user how to use the interface, and when the wizard was not user-tested. It maybe the case that information access is too variable a process for the use of wizards. A guided tour leads a user through a sequence of navigational choices through hypertext links, presenting the nodes in a logical order for some goal. In a dynamic tour, only relevant nodes are displayed, as opposed to the static case where the author decides what is relevant before the users have even formulated their queries [329]. A recent application is the Walden Paths project which enables teachers to define instructional!}* useful paths through pagers found nn the Web [289].   This approach has not been commonly used to date for 278        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION information access but could be a promising direction for acquainting users with search strategies in large hyperlinked systems.
mir-0191	10.4.4    Automated Source Selection Human-computer interfaces for helping guide users to appropriate sources is a wide open area for research. It requires both eliciting the information need from users and understanding which needs can be satisfied by which sources. An ambitious approach is to build a model of the source and of the information need of the user and try to determine which fit together best. User modeling systems and intelligent tutoring systems attempt to do this both for general domains [204, 814] and for online help systems [378]. A simpler alternative is to create a representation of the contents of information sources and match this representation against the query specification. This approach is taken by G1OSS, a system which tries to determine in advance the best bibliographic database to send a search request to, based on the terms in the query [765]. The system uses a simple analysis of the combined frequencies of the query words within the individual collections. The SavvySearch system [383] takes this idea a step further, using actions taken by users after a query to decide how to decrease or increase the ranking of a search engine for a particular query (see also Chapter 13). The flip side to automatically selecting the best source for a query is to automatically send a query to multiple sources and then combine the results from the various systems in some way. Many metasearch engines exist on the Web. How to combine the results effectively is an active area of research, sometimes known as collection fusion [63, 767, 388].
mir-0192	10,5    Query Specification To formulate a query, a user must select collections, metadata descriptions, or information sets against which the query is to be matched, and must specify words, phrases, descriptors, or other kinds of information that can be compared to or matched against the information in the collections. As a result, the system creates a set of documents, metadata, or other information type that match the query specification in some sense and displays the results to the user in some form. Shneiderman [725] identifies five primary human-computer interaction styles. These are: command language, form fillin, menu selection, direct manipulation, and natural language.^ Each technique lias been used in query specification interfaces and each has advantages and disadvantages. These are described below in the context of Boolean query specification. ß  This list limits non-visual modalities, such as audio. QUERY SPECIFICATION        279
mir-0193	10.5.1    Boolean Queries In modern information access systems the matching process usually employs a statistical ranking algorithm. However, until recently most commercial full-text systems and most bibliographic systems supported only Boolean queries. Thus the focus of many information access studies has been on the problems users have in specifying Boolean queries. Unfortunately, studies have shown time and again that most users have great difficulty specifying queries in Boolean format and often misjudge what the results will be [111, 322, 558, 841]. Boolean queries are problematic for several reasons. Foremost among these is that most people find the basic syntax counter-intuitive. Many English-speaking users assume everyday semantics are associated with Boolean operators when expressed using the English words AND and OR, rather than their logical equivalents. To inexperienced users, using AND implies the widening of the scope of the query, because more kinds of information are being requested. For instance, 'dogs and cats' may imply a request for documents about dogs and documents about cats, rather than documents about both topics at once. "Tea or coffee' can imply a mutually exclusive choice in everyday language. This kind of conceptual problem is well documented [111, 322, 558, 841]. In addition, most query languages that incorporate Boolean operators also require the user to specify complex syntax for other kinds of connectors and for descriptive metadata. Most users are not familiar with the use of parentheses for nested evaluation, nor with the notions associated with operator precedence. By serving a massive audience possessing little query-specification experience, the designers of World Wide Web search engines have had to come up with more intuitive approaches to query specification. Rather than forcing users to specify complex combinations of ANDs and ORs, they allow users to choose from a selection of common simple ways of combining query terms, including "all the words' (place all terms in a conjunction) and 'any of the words1 (place all terms in a disjunction). Another Web-based solution is to allow syntactically-based query specification, but to provide a simpler or more intuitive syntax. The '-}-' prefix operator gained widespread use with the advent of its use as a mandatory specifier in the Altavista Web search engine. Unfortunately, users can be misled to think it is an infix AND rather than a prefix mandatory operator, and thus assume that 'cat + dog1 will only retrieve articles containing both terms (where in fact this query requires dog but allows cat to be optional). Another problem with pure Boolean systems is they do not rank the retrieved documents according to their degree of match to the query. In the pure Boolean framework a document either satisfies the query or it does not. Commercial systems usually resort to ordering documents according to some kind of descriptive metadata, usually in reverse chronological order. (Since these systems usually index timely data corresponding to newspaper and news wires, date of publication is often one of the most salient features of the document.) Web-based systems usually rank order the results of Boolean queries using statistical algorithms and Web-specific heuristics. 280        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION 10.5.2    From Command Lines to Forms and Menus Aside from conceptual misunderstandings of the logical meaning of AND and OR, another part of the problem with pure Boolean query specification in online bibliographic systems is the arbitrariness of the syntax and the contextlessness nature of the TTY-based interface in which they are predominantly available. Typically input is typed at a prompt and is of a form something like the following: COMMAND ATTRIBUTE value  {BOOLEAN-OPERATOR  ATTRIBUTE value}* e.g., FIND PA darwin AND TW species OR TW descent or FIND TW Mt St. Helens AND DATE 1981 (These examples are derived from the syntax of the telnet interface to the University of California Melvyl system [526].) The user must remember the commands and attribute names, which are easily forgotten between usages of the system [553]. Compounding this problem, despite the fact that the command languages for the two main online bibliographic systems at UC Berkeley have different but very similar syntaxes, after more than ten years one of the systems still reports an error if the author field is specified as PA instead of PN, as is done in the other system. This lack of flexibility in the syntax is characteristic of interfaces designed to suit the system rather than its users. The new Web-based version of Melvyl || provides form fillin and menu selection so the user no longer has to remember the names and types of attributes available. Users select metadata types from listboxes and attributes are shown explicitly, allowing selection as an alternative to specification. For example, the 'search type1 field is adjacent to an entry form in which users can enter keywords, and a choice between AND and NOT is provided adjacent to a list of the available document types (editorial, feature, etc.). Only the metadata associated with a given collection is shown in the context of search over that collection. (Unfortunately the system is restricted to searching over only one database at a time. It does however provide a mechanism for applying a previously executed search to a new database.) See Figure 10.9. The Web-based version of Melvyl also allows retention of context between searches, storing prior results in tables and hyper linking these results to lists containing the retrieved bibliographic information. Users can also modify any of the previously submitted queries by selecting a checkbox beside the record of the query. The graphical display makes explicit and immediate many of the powerful options of the system that most users would not learn using the command-line version of the interface. Bit-mapped displays are an improvement over command-line interface, but do not solve all the problems.

mir-0194	10.5.3    Faceted Queries Yet another problem with Boolean queries is that their strict interpretation tends to yield result sets that are either too large, because the user includes many terms in a disjunct, or are empty, because the user conjoins terms in an effort to reduce the result set. This problem occurs in large part because the user does not know the contents of the collection or the role of terms within the collection. A common strategy for dealing with this problem, employed in systems with command-line-based interfaces like DIALOG'S, is to create a series of short queries, view the number of documents returned for each, and combine those queries that produce a reasonable number of results. For example, in DIALOG, each query produces a resulting set of documents that is assigned an identifying name. Rather than returning a list of titles themselves, DIALOG shows the set number with a listing of the number of matched documents. Titles can be shown by specifying the set number and issuing a command to show the titles. Document sets that are not empty can be referred to by a set name and combined with AND operations to produce new sets. If this set in turn is too small, the user can back up and try a different combination of sets, and this process is repeated in pursuit of producing a reasonably sized document set. This kind of query formulation is often called a faceted query, to indicate that the user's query is divided into topics or facets, each of which should be 282        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION present in the retrieved documents [553, 348]. For example, a query on drugs for the prevention of osteoporosis might consist of three facets, indicated by the disjuncts (osteoporosis OR 'bone loss') (drugs OR Pharmaceuticals) (prevention OR cure) This query implies that the user would like to view documents that contain all three topics. A technique to impose an ordering on the results of Boolean queries is what is known as post-coordinate or quorum-level ranking [700, Ch. 8]. In this approach, documents are ranked according to the size of the subset of the query terms they contain. So given a query consisting of 'cats,' 'dogs,' 'fish,' and 'mice/ the system would rank a document with at least one instance of 'cats/ wdogs/ and 'fish1 higher than a document containing 30 occurrences of 'cats' but no occurrences of the other terms. Combining faceted queries with quorum ranking yields a situation intermediate between full Boolean syntax and free-form natural language queries. An interface for specifying this kind of interaction can consist of a list of entry lines. The user enters one topic per entry line, where each topic consists of a list of semantically related terms that are combined in a disjunct. Documents that contain at least one term from each facet are ranked higher than documents containing terms only from one or a few facets. This helps ensure that documents which contain discussions of several of the user's topics are ranked higher than those that contain only one topic. By only requiring that one term from each facet be matched, the user can specify the same concept in several different ways in the hopes of increasing the likelihood of a match. If combined with graphical feedback about which subsets of terms matched the document, the user can see the results of a quorum ranking by topic rather than by word. Section 10.6 describes the TileBars interface which provides this type of feedback. Tiiis idea can be extended yet another step by allowing users to weight each facet. More likely to be readily usable, however, is a default weighting in which the facet listed highest is assigned the most weight, the second facet is assigned less weight, and so on, according to some distribution over weights.
mir-0195	10.5.4    Graphical Approaches to Query Specification Direct manipulation interfaces provide an alternative to command-line syntax. The properties of direct manipulation are [725, p.205]: (1) continuous representation of the object of interest, (2) physical actions or button presses instead of complex syntax, and (3) rapid incremental reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible. Direct manipulation interfaces often evoke enthusiasm from users, and for this reason alone it is worth exploring their use. Although they are not without drawbacks, they are easier to use than other methods for many users in many contexts.

The VQuery Venn diagram visualization for Boolean query specificaSeveral variations of graphical interfaces, both directly manipulable and static, have been developed for simplifying the specification of Boolean syntax. User studies tend to reveal that these graphical interfaces are more effective in terms of accuracy and speed than command-language counterparts. Three such approaches are described below. Graphical depictions of Venn diagrams have been proposed several times as a way to improve Boolean query specification. A query term is associated with a ring or circle and intersection of rings indicates conjunction of terms. Typically the number of documents that satisfy the various conjuncts are displayed within the appropriate segments of the diagram. Several studies have found such interfaces more effective than their command-language-based syntax [417, 368, 558]. Hertzum and Prokjaer found that a simple Venn diagram representation produced faster and more accurate results than a Boolean query syntax. However, a problem with this format is the limitations on the complexity of the expression. For example, a maximum of three query terms can be ANDed together in a standard Venn diagram. Innovations have been designed to get around this problem, as seen in the VQuery system [417] (see Figure 10.10). In VQuery, a direct manipulation interface allows users to assign any number of query terms to ovals. If two or more ovals are placed such that they overlap with one another, and if the user selects the area of their intersection, an AND is implied among those terms. (In Figure 10.10, the term "Query' is conjoined with 'Boolean'.) If the user selects outside the area of intersection but within the ovals, an OR is implied among the corresponding terms. A NOT operation 284        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Figure 10.11     The filter-flow visualization for Boolean query specification [841]. is associated with any term whose oval appears in the active area of the display but which remains unselected (in the figure, NOT 'Ranking' has been specified). An active area indicates the current query; all groups of ovals within the active area are considered part of a conjunction. Ovals containing query terms can be moved out of the active area for later use. Young and Shneiderman [841] found improvements over standard Boolean syntax by providing users with a direct manipulation filter-flow model. The user is shown a scrollable list of attribute types on the left-hand side and selects attributes from another list of attribute types shown across the top of the screen. Clicking on an attribute name causes a list box containing values for those attributes to be displayed in the main portion of the screen. The user then selects which values of the attributes to let the flow go through. Placing two or more of these attributes in sequence creates the semantics of a conjunct over the selected values. Placing two or more of these in parallel creates the semantics of a disjunct. The number of documents that match the query at each point is indicated by the width of the 'water* flowing from one attribute to the next. (See Figure 10.11. () A conjunct can reduce the amount of flow. The items that match the full query are shown on the far right-hand side. A user study found that fewer errors were made using the filter flow model than a standard SQL database query. However, the examples and study pertain only to database querying rather than information access, since the possible query terms for information access cannot he represented realistically in a scrollable list. This interface could perhaps be modified to better suit information access applications by having the user supply initial query terms, and using the attribute selection facility to show those terms QUERY SPECIFICATION        285 STARS:Query Reformulation Workspace File      Terms Help from	I! tape bu---------II	under scratch tape version 5 JDl Apply Changes  j| Display Tides | Figure 10.12 [21]. A block-oriented diagram visualization for Boolean query specification that are conceptually related to the query terms. Another alternative is to use this display as a category metadata selection interface (see Section 10.4). Anick et al [21] describe another innovative direct manipulation interface for Boolean queries. Initially the user types a natural language query which is automatically converted to a representation in which each query term is represented within a block. The blocks are arranged into rows and columns (See Figure 10.12). If two or more blocks appear along the same row they are considered to be ANDed together. Two or more blocks within the same column are ORed. Thus the user can represent a technical term in multiple ways within the same query, providing a kind of faceted query interface. For example, the terms 'version 5\ "version 5-0', and "vS1 might be shown in the same column. Users can quickly experiment with different combinations of terms "within Boolean queries simply by activating and deactivating blocks. This facility also allows users to have multiple representations of the same term in different places throughout the display, thus allowing rapid feedback on the consequences of specifying various combinations of query terms. Informal evaluation of the system found that users were able to learn to manipulate the interface quickly and enjoyed using it. It was not formally compared to other interaction techniques [21]. This interface provides a kind of query preview: a low cost, rapid turnaround visualization of the results of many variations on a query [643]. Another example of query previewing can be found in some help systems, which show all the words in the index whose first letters match the characters that the user has typed so far. The more characters typed, the fewer possible matches become available. The HiBrowse system described above (646] also provides a kind of preview for viewing category hierarchies and facets, showing how many documents would be matched if a category one level below the current one were selected. It perhaps could be improved by showing the consequences of more combinations of categories in an animated manner. If based on prior action and interests of the user, query previewing may become more generally applicable for information access interfaces. 286 USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Average annual pay, 1991 ?

A magic lens interface for query specification (courtesy  of Ken A final example of a graphical approach to query specification is the use of niagic lenses. Fishkin and Stone have suggested an extension to the usage of this visualization tool for the specification of Boolean queries [256]. Information is represented as lists or icons within a 2D space. Lenses act as filters on the document set. (See Figure 10.13.) For example, a word can be associated with a transparent lens. When this lens is placed over an iconic representation of a set of documents, it can cause all documents that do not contain a given word to disappear. If a second lens representing another word is then laid over the first, the lenses combine to act as a conjunction of the two words with the document set, hiding any documents that do not contain both words. Additional information can be adjusted dynamically, such as a minimum threshold for how often the term occurs in the documents, or an on-off switch for word stemming. For example. Figure 10.13 shows a disjunctive query that finds cities with relatively low housing prices or high annual salaries. One lens 'calls out' a clump of southern California cities, labeling each. Above that is a lens screening for cities with average house price below $194,821 (the data is from 1990), and above this one is a leiib screening for cities with average annual pay above $28,477. This approach, while promising, has not been evaluated in an information access setting.
mir-0196	10.5.5    Phrases and Proximity hi general, proximity iiifurmation can be quite1 effective at improving precision of  On the Web, the difference between a single-word query and a two-word QUERY SPECIFICATION        287 exact phrase match can mean the difference between an unmanageable mess of retrieved documents and a short list with mainly relevant documents. A large number of methods for specifying phrases have been developed. The syntax in LEXIS-NEXIS requires the proximity range to be specified with an infix operator. For example, 'white w/3 house' means 'white within 3 words of house, independent of order.' Exact proximity of phrases is specified by simply listing one word beside the other, separated by a space. A popular method used by Web search engines is the enclosure of the terms between quotation marks. Shneiderman et al. [726] suggest providing a list of entry labels, as suggested above for specifying facets. The difference is, instead of a disjunction, the terms on each line are treated as a phrase. This is suggested as a way to guide users to more precise query specification. The disadvantage of these methods is that they require exact match of phrases, when it is often the case (in English) that one or a few words comes between the terms of interest. For example, in most cases the user probably wants 'president' and 'lincoln' to be adjacent, but still wants to catch cases of the sort 'President Abraham Lincoln.' Another consideration is whether or not stemming is performed on the terms included in the phrase. The best solution may be to allow users to specify exact phrases but treat them as small proximity ranges, with perhaps an exponential fall-off in weight in terms of distance of the terms. This has been shown to be a successful strategy7 in non-interactive ranking algorithms [174]. It has also been shown that a combination of quorum ranking of faceted queries with the restriction that the facets occur within a small proximity range can dramatically improve precision of results [356, 566].
mir-0197	10.5.6    Natural Language and Free Text Queries Statistical ranking algorithms have the advantage of allowing users to specify queries naturally, without having to think about Boolean or other operators. But they have the drawback of giving the user less feedback about and control over the results. Usually the result of a statistical ranking is the listing of documents and the association of a score, probability, or percentage beside the title. Users are given little feedback about why the document received the ranking it did and what the roles of the query terms are. This can be especially problematic if the user is particularly interested in one of the query terms being present. One search strategy that can help with this particular problem with statistical ranking algorithms is the specification of 'mandatory' terms within the natural language query. This in effect helps the user control which terms are considered important, rather than relying on the ranking algorithm to correctly weight the query terms. But knowing to include a mandatory specification requires the user to know about a particular command and how it works. The preceding discussion assumes that a natural language query entered by the user is treated as a bag of words, with stopwords removed, for the purposes of document match. However, some systems attempt to parse natural language queries in order to extract concepts to match against concepts in the 288        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION text collection [399, 552, 748]. Alternatively, the natural language syntax of a question can be used to attempt to answer the question. (Question answering in information access is different than that of database management systems, since the information desired is encoded within the text of documents rather than specified by the database schema.) The Murax system [463] determines from the syntax of a question if the user is asking for a person, place, or date. It then attempts to find sentences within encyclopedia articles that contain noun phrases that appear in the question, since these sentences are likely to contain the answer to the question. For example, given the question Who was the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist that ran for mayor of New York City?,' the system extracts the noun phrases 'Pulitzer Prize,' 'winning novelist,' kmayor,' and 'New York City.' It then looks for proper nouns representing people's names (since this is a 'who' question) and finds, among others, the following sentences: The Armies of the Night (1968), a personal narrative of the 1967 peace march on the Pentagon, won Mailer the Pulitzer Prize and ª        the National Book Award. In 1969 Mailer ran unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for mayor of New York City. Thus the two sentences link together the relevant noun phrases and the system hypothesizes (correctly) from the title of the article in which the sentences appear that Norman Mailer is the answer. Another approach to automated question answering is the FAQ finder system which matches question-style queries against question-answer pairs on various topics [130]. The system uses a standard IR search to find the most likely FAQ (frequently asked questions) files for the question and then matches the terms in the question against the question portion of the question-answer pairs. A less automated approach to question answering can be found in the Ask Jeeves system [34]. This system makes use of hand-picked Web sites and matches these to a predefined set of question types. A user^s query is first matched against the question types. The user selects the most accurate rephrase of their question and this in turn is linked to suggested Web sites. For example, the question "Who is the leader of Sedan?1 is mapped into the question type 4Who is the head of state of X (Sudan)?1 where the variable is replaced by a listbox of choices, with Sudan the selected choice in this case. This is linked to a Web page that lists current heads of state. The system also automatically substitutes in the name 'Sudan* in a query against that Web page, thus bringing the answer directly to the user's attention. The question is also sent to standard Web search engines. However, a system is only as good as its question templates. For example a question "Where can I find reviews of spas in Calistoga?1 matches the question * Where can 1 find X (reviews) of activities for children aged Y (1)?' and "Where can I find a concise encyclopedia article on X (hot springs)?' CONTEXT        289
mir-0198	10.6    Context This section discusses interface techniques for placing the current document set in the context of other information types, in order to make the document set more understandable. This includes showing the relationship of the document set to query terms, collection overviews, descriptive metadata, hyperlink structure, document structure, and to other documents within the set.
mir-0199	10.6.1    Document Surrogates The most common way to show results for a query is to list information about documents in order of their computed relevance to the query. Alternatively, for pure Boolean ranking, documents are listed according to a metadata attribute, such as date. Typically the document list consists of the document's title and a subset of important metadata, such as date, source, and length of the article. In systems with statistical ranking, a numerical score or percentage is also often shown alongside the title, where the score indicates a computed degree of match or probability of relevance. This kind of information is sometimes referred to as a document surrogate. See Figure 10.14 from [824]. Some systems provide users with a choice between a short and a detailed view. The detailed view typically contains a summary or abstract. In bibliographic systems, the author-written or service-written abstract is shown. Web search engines automatically generate excerpts, usually extracting the first few lines of non-markup text in the Web page. In most interfaces, clicking on the document's title or an iconic representation of the document shown beside the title will bring up a view of the document itself, either in another window on the screen, or replacing the listing of search results. (In traditional bibliographic systems, the full text was unavailable online, and only bibliographic records could be readily viewed.)
mir-0200	10.6.2    Query Term Hits Within Document Content In systems in which the user can view the full text of a retrieved document, it is often useful to highlight the occurrences of the terms or descriptors that match those of the user's query. It can also be useful for the system to scroll the view of the document to the first passage that contains one or more of the query terms, and highlight the matched terms in a contrasting color or reverse video. This display is thought to help draw the user's attention to the parts of the document most likely to be relevant to the query. Highlighting of query terms lias been found time and again to be a useful feature for information access interfaces [481], [542, p.31]. Color highlighting has also recently been found to be useful for scanning lists of bibliographic records [52]. 290        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Jjfc yi#i^!http//w mm   tuiuimm    help    feebmok.

KWIC A facility related to highlighting is the key word-in-context (KWIC) document surrogate. Sentence fragments, full sentences, or groups of sentences that contain query terms are extracted from the full text and presented for viewing along with other kinds of surrogate information (such as document title and abstract). Note that a KWIC listing is different than an abstract. An abstract summarizes the main topics of the document but might not contain references to the terms within the query. A KWIC extract shows sentences that summarize the ways the query terms are used within the document. This display can show not only which subsets of query terms occur in the retrieved documents, but also the context they appeal in with respect to one another. Tradeoff decisions must be made between how many lines of text to show and which lines to display, It is not known which contexts are best selected for viewing but results from text summarization research suggest that the best fragments to show art8 those that appear near the beginning of the document and that routaiu the largest subset of query terms [464]. If users have specified which CONTEXT        291 terms are more important than others, then those fragments containing important terms should be shown before those that contain only less important terms. However, to help retain coherence of the excerpts, selected sentences should be shown in order of their occurrence in the original document, independent of how many search terms they contain. The KWIC facility is usually not shown in Web search result display, most likely because the system must have a copy of the original document available from which to extract the sentences containing the search terms. Web search engines typically only retain the index without term position information. Systems that index individual Web sites can show KWIC information in the document list display. TileBars A more compact form of query term hit display is made available through the TileBars interface. The user enters a query in a faceted format, with one topic per line. After the system retrieves documents (using a quorum or statistical ranking algorithm), a graphical bar is displayed next to the title of each document showing the degree of match for each facet. TileBars thus illustrate at a glance which passages in each article contain which topics - and moreover, how frequently each topic is mentioned (darker squares represent more frequent matches). Each document is represented by a rectangular bar. Figure 10.15 shows an example. The bar is subdivided into rows that correspond to the query facets. The top row of each TileBar corresponds to 'osteoporosis/ the second row to 'prevention,' and the third row to 'research.1 The bar is also subdivided into columns, where each column refers to a passage within the document. Hits that overlap within the same passage are more likely to indicate a relevant document than hits that are widely dispersed throughout the document [356]. The patterns are meant to indicate whether terms from a facet occur as a main topic throughout the document, as a subtopic, or are just mentioned in passing. The darkness of each square corresponds to the number of times the query occurs in that segment of text; the darker the square the greater the number of hits. White indicates no hits on the query term. Thus, the user can quickly see if some subset of the terms overlap in the same segment of the document. (The segments for this version of the interface are fixed blocks of 100 tokens each.) The first document can be seen to have considerable overlap among the topics of interest towards the middle, but not at the beginning or the end (the actual end is cut off). Thus it most likely discusses topics in addition to research into osteoporosis. The second through fourth documents, which are considerably shorter, also have overlap among all terms of interest, and so are also probably of interest to the user. (The titles help to verify this.) The next three documents are all long, and from the TileBars we can tell they discuss research and prevention, but do not even touch on osteoporosis, and so probably are not of interest. Because the TileBars interface-* allows the user to specify the query in terms 292        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION User Query {Enter wtttds for different topk	son different Unas.)

When the user displays a document with query term hits, the user can quickly ascertain what proportion of search topics appear in a passage based only on how many different highlight colors are visible. Most systems that use highlighting use only a single color to bring attention to all of the search terms. It would be difficult for users to specify in advance which patterns of term hits they are interested in. Instead, TileBars allows users to scan graphic representations and recognize which documents are and are not of interest. It may be the case that TileBars may be most useful for helping users discard mislead-ingly interesting documents, but only preliminary studies have been conducted to date. Passages can correspond to paragraphs or sections, fixed sized units of arbitrary length, or to automatically determined multiparagraph segments [355]. SeeSoft The SeeSoft visualization [232] represents text in a manner resembling columns of newspaper text, with one line' of text on each horizontal line of the strip. (See Figure 10.16.) The representation is compact and aesthetically pleasing. Graphics are used to abstract away the details, providing an overview showing the amount and shape of the text. Color highlighting is used to pick out various attributes, such as where a particular word appears in the text. Details of a smaller portion of the display can be viewed via a pop-up window; the overview CONTEXT        293 shows more of the text but in less detail. Figure 10.16 An example of the SeeSoft visualization for showing locations of characters within a text [232]. SeeSoft was originally designed for software development, in which a line of text is a meaningful unit of information. (Programmers tend to place each individual programming statement on one line of text.) Thus SeeSoft shows attributes relevant to the programming domain, such as which lines of code were modified by which programmer, and how often particular lines have been modified, and how many days have elapsed since the lines were last modified. The SeeSoft developers then experimented with applying this idea to the display of text, although this has not been integrated into an information access system. Color highlighting is used to show which characters appear where in a book of fiction, and which passages of the Bible contain references to particular people and items. Note the use of the abstraction of an entire line to stand for a single word such as a character's name (even though though this might obscure a tightly interwoven conversation between two characters).
mir-0201	10.6.3    Query Term Hits Between Documents Other visualization ideas have been developed to show a different kind of information about the relationship between query terms and retrieved documents. Rather than showing how query terms appear within individual documents, as is done in KWIC interfaces and TileBars, these systems display an overview or summary of the retrieved documents according to which subset of query terms they contain. The following subsections describe variations on this idea. 294        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Figure 10.17     A sketch of the InfoCrystai retrieval results display [738]. InfoCrystal The InfoCrystai shows how many documents contain each subset of query terms [738]. This relieves the user from the need to specify Boolean ANDs and ORs in their query, while still showing which combinations of terms actually appear in documents that were ordered by a statistical ranking (although beyond four terms the interface becomes difficult to understand). The InfoCrystai allows visualization of all possible relations among N user-specified 'concepts' (or Boolean keywords). The InfoCrystai displays, in a clever extension of the Venn diagram paradigm, the number of documents retrieved that have each possible subset of the N concepts. Figure 10.17 shows a sketch of what the InfoCrystai might display as the result of a query against four keywords or Boolean phrases, labeled A, B, C. and D. The diamond in the center indicates that one document was discovered that contains all four keywords. The triangle marked with *12" indicates that 12 documents were found containing attributes A, B, and D, and so on. The InfoCrystai does not show proximity among the terms within the documents, nor their relative frequency. So a document that contains dozens of hits on 'volcano' and 'lava' and one hit on 'Mars' will be grouped with documents that contain mainly hits on 'Mars' but just one mention each of 'volcano* and iava." authoring CONTEXT        295 navigation l hypertext-engineering knowledge representation usabili1y-links-and-fbtion                             .   _        u               ._....._.                  __^ ^                        '  ^^                    ïï^"'¶'     ^                 ó------fmplernentationsand-in1er1aces application Figure 10.18     An example of the VIBE retrieval results display [452]. VIBE and Lyberworld Graphical presentations that operate on similar principles are VIBE [452] and Lyberworld [363]. In these displays, query terms are placed in an abstract graphical space. After the search, icons are created that indicate how many documents contain each subset of query terms. The subset status of each group of documents is indicated by the placement of the icon. For example, in VIBE a set of documents that contain three out of five query terms are shown on an axis connecting these three terms, at a point midway between the representations of the three query terms in question. (See Figure 10.18.) Lyberworld presents a 3D version of this idea. Lattices Several researchers have employed a graphical depiction of a mathematical lattice for the purposes of query formulation, where the query consists of a set of constraints on a hierarchy of categories (actually, semantic attributes in these systems) [631, 147]. This is one solution to the problem of displaying documents in terms of multiple attributes; a document containing terms A, B, C, and D could be placed at a point in the lattice with these four categories as parents. However, if such a representation were to be applied to retrieval results instead of query formulation, the lattice layout would in most cases be too complex to allow for readability. None of the displays discussed in this subsection have been evaluated for effectiveness at improving query specification or understanding of retrieval results, but they are intriguing ideas and perhaps are useful in conjunct ion with other displays. 296        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION  ¶3m ___ d Figure 10.19     The SuperBook interface for showing retrieval results on a large manual in context [481]. 10.6.4    SuperBook: Context via Table of Contents The SuperBook system [481, 229, 230] makes use of the structure of a large document to display query term hits in context. The table of contents (TOC) for a book or manual are shown in a hierarchy on the left-hand side of the display, and full text of a page or section is shown on the right-hand side. The user can manipulate the table of contents to expand or contract the view of sections and subsections. A focus-plus-context mechanism is used to expand the viewing area of the sections currently being looked at and compress the remaining sections. When the user moves the cursor to another part of the TOC, the display changes dynamically, making the new focus larger and shrinking down the previously observed sections. After the user specifies a query on the book, the search results are shown in the context of the table of contents hierarchy. (See Figure 10.19.) Those sections that contain search hits are made larger and the others are compressed. The query terms that appear in chapter or section names are highlighted in reverse video. When the user selects a page from the table of contents view, the page itself is displayed on the right-hand side and the query terms within the page are highlighted in reverse video. The SuperBook designers created innovative techniques for evaluating its special features. Subjects were compared using this system against using paper (Iocunieiitatiori and against a more standard online infoririatiori access system. Subjects were also compared on different kinds of carefully selected tasks: browsing topics of interest, citation searching, searching to answer questions, and searching and browsing to write summary essays.   For most of the tasks CONTEXT        297 SuperBook subjects were faster and more accurate or equivalent in speed and accuracy to a standard system. When differences arose between SuperBook and the standard system, the investigators examined the logs carefully and hypothesized plausible explanations. After the initial studies, they modified SuperBook according to these hypotheses and usually saw improvements as a result [481]. The user studies on the improved system showed that users were faster and more accurate at answering questions in which some of the relevant terms were within the section titles themselves, but they were also faster and more accurate at answering questions in which the query terms fell within the full text of the document only, as compared both to a paper manual and to an interface that did not provide such contextualizing information. SuperBook was not faster than paper when the query terms did not appear in the document text or the table of contents. This and other evidence from the SuperBook studies suggests that query term highlighting is at least partially responsible for improvements seen in the system.
mir-0202	10.6.5    Categories for Results Set Context In section 10.4 we saw the use of category or directory information for providing overviews of text collection content. Category metadata can also be used to place the results of a query in context. For example, the original formulation of SuperBook allowed navigation within a highly structured document, a computer manual. The CORE project extended the main idea to a collection of over 1000 full-text chemistry articles. A study of this representation demonstrated its superiority to a standard search system on a variety of task types [228]. Since a table of contents is not available for this collection, context is provided by placing documents within a category hierarchy containing terms relevant to chemistry. Documents assigned a category are listed when that category is selected for more detailed viewing, and the categories themselves are organized into a hierarchy, thus providing a hierarchical view on the collection. Another approach to using predefined categories to provide context for retrieval results is demonstrated by the DynaCat system [650]. The DynaCat system organizes retrieved documents according to which types of categories, selected from the large MeSH taxonomy, are known in advance to be important for a given query type. DynaCat begins with a set of query types known to be useful for a given user population and collection. One query type can encompass many different queries. For example, the query type 'Treatment-Adverse Effects' covers queries such as 'What are the complications of a mastectomy?* as well as 'What are the side-effects of aspirin?1 Documents are organized according to a set of criteria associated with each query type. These criteria specify which types of categories that are acceptable to use for organizing the documents and consequently, which categories should be omitted from the display. Once categories have been assigned to the retrieved documents, a hierarchy is formed based on where the categories exist within MeSH. The algorithm selects only a subset of the category 298 USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION i Query:Wttat are tite ways to frtevent breast cane* !

Figure 10.20 shows the results for a query on breast cancer prevention. The interface is tiled into three windows. The top window displays the user's query and the number of documents found. The left window shows the categories in the first two levels of the hierarchy, providing a table of contents view of the organization of search results. The right pane displays ail the categories in the hierarchy and the titles of the documents that belong in those categories. An obstacle to using category labels to organize retrieval results is the requirement of precompiled knowledge about which categories are of interest for a particular user or a particular query type. The SONIA system [692] circumvents this problem by using a combination of misupervised and supervised methods to organize a set of documents. The misupervised method (document clustering similar to Scatter/Gat her) imposes an initial organization on a user's personal information collection or on a set of documents retrieved as the result of a query. The user can then invoke a direct manipulation interface to make adjustoients to tliis Initial clustering, causing it to align more closely with their preferences (IwaiLse uiLsupervised methods do not usually produce an organization that n´Tespond.s to a human-derived category structure [857]). The resulting organization is then used to train a supervised text categorization algorithm which automatically classifies any new documents that are added to the collection. As the collection grows it can be periodically reorganized by rerunning the clustering algorithm and redoing the manual adjustments. CONTEXT        299
mir-0203	10.6.6    Using Hyperlinks to Organize Retrieval Results Although the SuperBook authors describe it as a hypertext system, it is actually better thought of as a means of showing search results in the context of a structure that users can understand and view all at once. The hypertext component was not analyzed separately to assess its importance, but it usually is not mentioned by the authors when describing what is successful about their design. In fact, it seems to be responsible for one of the main problems seen with the revised version of the system ó that users tend to wander off (often unintentionally) from the pages they are reading, thus causing the time spent on a given topic to be longer for SuperBook in some cases. (Using completion time to evaluate users on browsing tasks can be problematic, however, since by definition browsing is a casual, unhurried process [804].) This wandering may occur in part because SuperBook uses a non-standard kind of hypertext, in which any word is automatically linked to occurrences of the same word in other parts of the document. This has not turned out to be how hypertext links are created in practice. Today, hyperlinked help systems and hyperlinks on the Web make much more discriminating use of hyperlink connections (in part since they are usually generated by an author rather than automatically). These links tend to be labeled in a somewhat meaningful manner by their surrounding context. Back-of-the-book indexes often do not contain listings of every occurrence of a word, but rather to the more important uses or the beginnings of series of uses. Automated hypertext linking should perhaps be based on similar principles. Additionally, at least one study showed that users formed better mental models of a small hypertext system that was organized hierarchically than one that allowed more flexible access [226]. Problems relating to navigation of hypertext structure have long been suspected and investigated in the hypertext literature [181, 551, 440, 334]. More recent work has made better use of hyperlink information for providing context for retrieval results. Some of this work is described below. Cha-Cha: SuperBook on the Web The Cha-Cha intranet search system [164] extends the SuperBook idea to a large heterogeneous Web site such as might be found in an organization's intranet. Figure 10.21 shows an example. This system differs from SuperBook in several ways. On most Web sites there is no existing real table of contents or category structure, and an intranet like those found at large universities or large corporations is usually not organized by one central unit. Cha-Cha uses link structure present within the site to create what is intended to be a meaningful organization on top of the underlying chaos. After the user issues a query, the shortest paths from the root page to each of the search hits are recorded and a subset of these are selected to be shown as a hierarchy, so that each hit is shown only once. (Users can begin with a query, rather than with a table of contents view.)

Users can then either query or navigate within a subset of sites if they wish. The organization produced by this simple method is surprisingly comprehensible on the UC Berkeley site. It seems especially useful for providing the information about the sources (the Web server) associated with the search hits, whose titles are often cryptic. The AMIT system [826] also applies the basic ideas behind SuperBook to the Web, but focuses on a single-topic Web site, which is likely to have a more reasonable topic structure than a complex intranet. The link structure of the Web site is used as contextualizing information but all of the paths to a given, document are shown and focus-plus-context is used to emphasize subsets of the document space. The WebTOC system [585] is similar to AMIT but focuses on showing the structure and number of documents within each Web subhierarchy, and is not tightly coupled with search.

Mapuccino: Graphical Depiction of Link Structure The Mapuccino system (formerly WebCutter) [527] allows the user to issue a query on a particular Web site. The system crawls the site in real-time, checking each encountered page for relevance to the query. When a relevant page is found, the weights on that page's outlinks are increased. Thus, the search is based partly on an assumption that relevant pages will occur near one another in the Web site. The subset of the Web site that has been crawled is depicted graphically in a nodes-and-links view (see Figure 10.22). This kind of display does not provide the user with information about what the contents of the pages are, but rather only shows their link structure- Other researchers have also investigated spreading activation among hypertext links as a way to guide an information retrieval system, e.g., [278, 555].
mir-0204	10.6.7    Tables Tabular display is another approach for showing relationships among retrieval documents. The Envision system [273] allows the user to organize results according to metadata such as author or date along the X and Y-axes, and uses graphics to show values for attributes associated with retrieved documents within each cell (see Figure 10.23). Color, shape, and size of an iconic representation of a document are used to show the computed relevance, the type of document, or 302 USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Key constraints governing human 1983 Tho Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction 1904    Human Liadts and  tha VDT Coadjutor Intotiaco Figure 10.23     The Envision tabular display for graphically organizing retrieved documents [270]. other attributes. Clicking on an icon brings up more information about the document in another window. Like the WebCutter system, this view provides few cues about how the documents are related to one another in terms of their content or meaning. The SenseMaker system also allows users to group documents into different views via a table-like display [51], including a Scatter/Gather [203] style view. Although tables are appealing, they cannot show the intersections of many different attributes; rather they are better for pairwise comparisons. Another problem with tables for display of textual Information is that very little information can be fitted on a screen at a time, making comparisons difficult. The Table Lens [666] is an innovative interface for viewing and interactively reorganizing very large tables of information (see Figure 10.24). It uses focus-plus-context to fit hundreds of rows of information in a space occupied by at most two dozen rows in standard spreadsheets. And because it allows for rapid reorganization via sorting of columns, users can quickly switch from a view focused around one kind of metadata to another. For example, first sorting documents by rank and then by author name can show the relative ranks of different articles by the same author. A re-sort by date can show patterns in relevance scores with respect to date of publication. This rapid re-sorting capability helps circumvent the problems associated with the fact that tables cannot show many simultaneous intersections. Another variation on the table theme Is that seen in the Perspective Wall [530] in which a focuH-plas-coritext display is used to center information currently USING RELEVANCE JUDGEMENTS 303 68490CL   _____l 287658 427500.______M79550 L1617B4 Figure 10.24     The TableLens visualization [666]. of interest in the middle of the display, compressing less important information into the periphery on the sides of the wall. The idea is to show in detail the currently most important information while at the same time retaining the context of the rest of the information. For example, if viewing documents in chronological order, the user can easily tell if they are currently looking at documents in the beginning, middle, or end of the time range. These interfaces have not been applied to information access tasks. The problem with such displays when applied to text is that they require an attribute that can be shown according to an underlying order, such as date. Unfortunately, information useful for organizing text content, such as topic labels, does not have an inherent meaningful order. Alphabetical order is useful for looking up individual items, but not for seeing patterns across items according to adjacency, as in the case for ordered data types like dates and size.
mir-0205	10.7    Using Relevance Judgements An import ant part of the information access process is query reformulation, and a proven effective technique for query reformulation is relevance feedback. In its original form, relevance feedback refers to an interaction cycle in which the user selects a small set of documents that appear to be relevant to the query, and the system then uses features derived from these selected relevant documents to revise the original query. This revised query is then executed and a new set of documents is returned. Documents from the original set can appear in the new results 304        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION list, although they are likely to appear in a different rank order. Relevance feedback in its original form has been shown to be an effective mechanism for improving retrieval results in a variety of studies and settings [702, 343, 127]. In recent years the scope of ideas that can be classified under this term has widened greatly. Relevance feedback introduces important design choices, including which operations should be performed automatically by the system and which should be user initiated and controlled. Bates discusses this issue in detail [66], asserting that despite the emphasis in modern systems to try to automate the entire process, an intermediate approach in which the system helps automate search at a strategic level is preferable. Bates suggests an analogy of an automatic camera versus one with adjustable lenses and shutter speeds. On many occasions, a quick, easy method that requires little training or thought is appropriate. At other times the user needs more control over the operation of the machinery, while still not wanting to know about the low level details of its operation. A related idea is that, for any interface, control should be described in terms of the task being done, not in terms of how the machine can be made to accomplish the task [607]. Continuing the camera analogy, the user should be able to control the mood created by the photograph, rather than the adjustment of the lens. In information access systems, control should be over the kind of information returned, not over which terms are used to modify the query. Unfortunately it is often quite difficult to build interfaces to complex systems that behave in this manner.
mir-0206	10.7.1    Interfaces for Standard Relevance Feedback A standard interface for relevance feedback consists of a list of titles with checkboxes beside the titles that allow the user to mark relevant documents. This can imply either that unmarked documents are not relevant or that no opinion has been made about unmarked documents, depending on the system. Another option is to provide a choice among several checkboxes indicating relevant or not relevant (with no selection implying no opinion). In some cases users are allowed to indicate a value on a relevance scale [73]. Standard relevance feedback algorithms usually do not perform better given negative relevance judgement evidence [225], but machine learning algorithms can take advantage of negative feedback [629, 460]. After the user has made a set of relevance judgements and issued a search command, the system can either automatically reweight the query and re-execute the search, or generate a list of terms for the user to select from in order to augment the original query. (See Figure 10.25, taken from [448].) Systems usually do not suggest terms to remove from the query. After the query is re-executed, a new list of titles is shown. It can be helpful to retain an indicator such as a marked checkbox beside the documents that the usc^r has already judged. A difficult design decision concerns whether or not to show documents that the user lias already viewed towards the top of the ranked list 111 Repeatedly showing the same set of documents at the top may inconvenience a user who is trying to create a large set of relevant documents.

One solution is to retain a separate window that shows the rankings of only the documents that have not been retrieved or ranked highly previously. Another solution is to use smaller fonts or gray-out color for the titles of documents already seen. Creating multiple relevance judgements is an effortful task, and the notion of relevance feedback is unfamiliar to most users. To circumvent these problems, Web-based search engines have adopted the terminology of 'more like this1 as a simpler way to indicate that the user is requesting documents similar to the selected one. This 4one-click' interaction method is simpler than standard relevance feedback dialog which requires users to rate a small number of documents and then request a reranking. Unfortunately, in most cases relevance feedback requires many relevance judgements in order to work well. To partly alleviate this problem, Aalbersberg [1] proposes incremental relevance feedback which works well given only one relevant document at a time and thus can be used to hide the two-step procedure from the user.
mir-0207	10.7.2    Studies of User Interaction with Relevance Feedback Systems Standard relevance feedback assumes the user is involved in the interaction by specifying the relevant documents.   In some interfaces users are also able to 306        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION select which terms to add to the query. However, most ranking and reweighting algorithms are difficult to understand or predict (even for the creators of the algorithms!) and so it might be the case that users have difficulties controlling a relevance feedback system explicitly. A recent study was conducted to investigate directly to what degree user control of the feedback process is beneficial. Koenemann and Belkin [448] measured the benefits of letting users 'under the hood' during relevance feedback. They tested four cases using the Inquery system [772]: ï  Control No relevance feedback; the subjects could only reformulate the query by hand. ï  Opaque The subjects simply selected relevant documents and saw the revised rankings. ï  Transparent The subjects could see how the system reformulated the queries (that is, see which terms were added ó the system did not reweight the subjects1 query terms) and the revised rankings. ï  Penetrable The system is stopped midway through the reranking process. The subjects are shown the terms that the system would have used for opaque and transparent query reformulation.    The subjects then select which, if any, of the new terms to add to the query.   The system then presents the revised rankings. The 64 subjects were much more effective (measuring precision at a cutoff of top 5, top 10, top 30, and top 100 documents) with relevance feedback than without it. The penetrable group performed significantly better than the control, with the opaque and transparent performances falling between the two in effectiveness. Search times did not differ significantly among the conditions, but there were significant differences in the number of feedback iterations. The subjects in the penetrable group required significantly fewer iterations to achieve better queries (an average of 5.8 cycles in the penetrable group, 8.2 cycles in the control group, 7.7 cycles in the opaque group, and surprisingly, the transparent group required more cycles, 8.8 on average). The average number of documents marked relevant ranged between 11 and 14 for the three conditions. All subjects preferred relevance feedback over the baseline system, and several remarked that they preferred the lazy' approach of selecting suggested terms over having to think up their own. An observational study on a TTY-based version of an online catalog system [338] also found that users performed better using a relevance feedback mechanism that allowed manual selection of terms. However, a later observational study did not find overall success with this form of relevance feedback [337]. The authors attribute these results to a poor design of a new graphical interface. These* results may also be due to the fact that users often selected only one relevant document before performing the feedback operation, although then' were using a system optimized from multiple document selection. USING RELEVANCE JUDGEMENTS         307
mir-0208	10.7.3    Fetching Relevant Information in the Background Standard relevance feedback is predicated on the goal of improving an ad hoc query or building a profile for a routing query. More recently researchers have begun developing systems that monitor users' progress and behavior over long interaction periods in an attempt to predict which documents or actions the user is likely to want in future. These systems are called semi-automated assistants or recommender 'agents,' and often make use of machine learning techniques [565]. Some of these systems require explicit user input in the form of a goal statement [406] or relevance judgements [629], while others quietly record users' actions and try to make inferences based on these actions. A system developed by Kozierok and Maes [460, 536] makes predictions about how users will handle email messages (what order to read them in, where to file them) and how users will schedule meetings in a calendar manager application. The system 'looks over the shoulder7 of the users, recording every relevant action into a database. After enough data has been accumulated, the system uses a nearest-neighbors method [743] to predict a user's action based on the similarity of the current situation to situations already encountered. For example, if the user almost always saves email messages from a particular person into a particular file, the system can offer to automate this action the next time a message from that person arrives [536]. This system integrates learning from both implicit and explicit user feedback. If a user ignores the system's suggestion, the system treats this as negative feedback, and accordingly adds the overriding action to the action database. After certain types of incorrect predictions, the system asks the user questions that allow it to adjust the weight of the feature that caused the error. Finally, the user can explicitly train the system by presenting it with hypothetical examples of input-action pairs. Another system, Syskill and Webert [629], attempts to learn a user profile based on explicit relevance judgements of pages explored while browsing the Web. In a sense this is akin to standard relevance feedback, except the user judgements are retained across sessions and the interaction model differs: as the user browses a new Web page, the links on the page are automatically annotated as to whether or not they should be relevant to the user's interest. A related system is Letizia [518], whose goal is to bring to the user's attention a percentage of the available next moves that are most likely to be of interest, given the user's earlier actions. Upon request, Letizia provides recommendations for further action on the user's part, usually in the form of suggestions of links to follow when the user is unsure what to do next. The system monitors the user's behavior while navigating and reading Web pages, and concurrently evaluates the links reachable from the current page. The system uses only implicit feedback. Thus, saving a page as a bookmark is taken as strong positive evidence for the terms in the corresponding Web page. Links skipped are taken as negative support for the information reachable from the link. Selected links can indicate positive or negative evidence, depending on how much time the user spends on the resulting page and whether or not the decision to leave a page quickly is later reversed.  Additionally, the evidence for user interest remains persistent across 308        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION browsing sessions. Thus, a user who often reads kayaking pages is at another time reading the home page of a professional contact and may be alerted to the fact that the colleague's personal interests page contains a link to a shared hobby. The system uses a best-first search strategy and heuristics to determine which pages to recommend most strongly. A more user-directed approach to prefetching potentially relevant information is seen in the Butterfly system [531]. This interface helps the user follow a series of citation links from a given reference, an important information seeking strategy [66]. The system automatically examines the document the user is currently reading and prefetches the bibliographic citations it refers to. It also retrieves lists of articles that cite the focus document. The underlying assumption is that the services from which the citations are requested do not respond immediately. Rather than making the user wait during the delay associated with each request, the system handles many requests in parallel and the interface uses graphics and animations to show the incrementally growing list of available citations. The system does not try to be clever about which cites to bring first; rather the user can watch the 'organically' growing visualization of the document and its citations, and based on what looks relevant, direct the system as to which parts of the citation space to spend more time on.
mir-0209	10.7.4    Group Relevance Judgements Recently there has been much interest in using relevance judgements from a large number of different users to rate or rank information of general interest [672], Some variations of this social recommendation approach use only similarity among relevance judgements by people with similar tastes, ignoring the representation of the information being judged altogether. This has been found highly effective for rating information in which taste plays a major role, such as movie and music recommendations [720]. More recent work has combined group relevance judgements with content information [64],
mir-0210	10.7.5    Pseudo-Relevance Feedback At the far end of the system versus user feedback spectrum is what is informally known as pseudo-relevance feedback. In this method, rather than relying on the user to choose the top k relevant documents, the system simply assumes that its top-ranked documents are relevant, and uses these documents to augment the query with a relevance feedback ranking algorithm. This procedure has been found to be highly effective in some settings [760, 465, 12], most likely those in which the original query statement is long and precise. An intriguing extension to this idea is to use the output of clustering of retrieval results as the input to a relevance feedback mechanism, either by having the user or the system select the cluster to be used [359], but this idea has not yet been evaluated. INTERFACE SUPPORT FOR THE SEARCH PROCESS        309
mir-0211	10.8    Interface Support for the Search Process The user interface designer must make decisions about how to arrange various kinds of information on the computer screen and how to structure the possible sequences of interactions. This design problem is especially daunting for a complex activity like information access. In this section we discuss design choices surrounding the layout of information within complex information systems, and illustrate the ideas with examples of existing interfaces. We begin with a discussion of very simple search interfaces, those used for string search in 'find' operations, and then progress to rnultrwindow interfaces and sophisticated workspaces. This is followed by a discussion of the integration of scanning, selecting, and querying within information access interfaces and concludes with interface support for retaining the history of the search process.
mir-0212	10.8.1    Interfaces for String Matching A common simple search need is that of the 'find' operation, typically run over the contents of a document that is currently being viewed. Usually this function does not produce ranked output, nor allow Boolean combinations of terms; the main operation is a simple string match (without regular expression capabilities). Typically a special purpose search window is created, containing a few simple controls (e.g., case-sensitivity, search forward or backward). The user types the query string into an entry form and string matches are highlighted in the target document (see Figure 10.26). The next degree of complexity is the 'find' function for searching across small collections, such as the files on a personal computer's hard disk, or the history list of a Web browser. This type of function is also usually implemented as a simple string match. Again, the controls and parameter settings are shown at the top of a special purpose search window and the various options are set via checkboxes and entry forms. The difference from the previous example is that a results list is shown within the search interface itself (see Figure 10.27). A common problem arises even in these very simple interfaces. An ambiguous state occurs in which the results for an earlier search are shown while the user is entering a new query or modifying the previous one. If the user types in jhrcrr-aticn                [                                I    FindNxt   \ Direction Figure 10.26     An example of a simple interface for string matching, from Netscape Communicator 4.05. 310        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Search for items in the Htap List where; Search [Title ]Contains j*J jberkeleii gear     j Help Title Location J FirstVisfted] LastVisftedjExpiration   | Visit..T _ Searching UC...

One solution for this problem is to clear the results list as soon as the user begins to type in a new query. However, the user may want to refer to terms shown in the search results to help reformulate the query, or may decide not to issue the new query and instead continue with the previous results. These goals would be hampered by erasing the current result set as soon as the new query is typed. Another solution is to bring up a new window for every new query. However, this requires the user to execute an additional command and can lead to a proliferation of windows. A third, probably more workable solution, is to automatically "stack1 the queries and results lists in a compact format and allow the user to move back and forth among the stacked up prior searches. Simple interfaces like these can be augmented with functionality that can greatly aid initial query formulation. Spelling errors are a major cause of void result sets. A spell-checking function that suggests alternatives for query terms that have low frequency in the collection might be useful at this stage. Another option is to suggest thesaurus terms associated with the query terras at the time the query terms are entered. Usually these kinds of information are shown after the query is entered and documents have been retrieved, but an alternative is to provide this information as the user enters the query, in a form of query preview. INTERFACE SUPPORT FOR THE SEARCH PROCESS        311
mir-0213	10.8.2    Window Management For search tasks more complex than the simple string matching find operations described above, the interface designer must decide how to lay out the various choices and information displays within the interface. As discussed above, traditional bibliographic search systems use TTY-based command-line interfaces or menus. When the system responds to a command, the new results screen obliterates the contents of the one before it, requiring the user to remember the context. For example, the user can usually see only one level of a subject hierarchy at a time, and must leave the subject view in order to see query view or the document view. The main design choices in such a system are in the command or menu structure, and the order of presentation of the available options. In modern graphical interfaces, the windowing system can be used to divide functionality into different, simultaneously displayed views [582]. In information access systems, it is often useful to link the information from one window to the information in another, for example, linking documents to their position in a table of contents, as seen in SuperBook. Users can also use the selection to cut and paste information from one window into another, for example, copy a word from a display of thesaurus terms and paste the word into the query specification form. When arranging information within windows, the designer must choose between a monolithic display, in which all the windows are laid out in predefined positions and are all simultaneously viewable, tiled windows, and overlapping windows. User studies have been conducted comparing these options when applied to various tasks [725, 96]. Usually the results of these studies depend on the domain in which the interface is used, and no clear guidelines have yet emerged for information access interfaces. The monolithic interface has several advantages. It allows the designer to control the organization of the various options, makes all the information simultaneously viewable, and places the features in familiar positions, making them easier to find. But monolithic interfaces have disadvantages as well. They often work best if occupying the full viewing screen, and the number of views is inherently limited by the amount of room available on the screen (as opposed to overlapping windows which allow display of more information than can fit on the screen at once). Many modern work-intensive applications adopt a monolithic design, but this can hamper the integration of information access with other work processes such as text editing and data analysis. Plaisant et al. [644] discuss issues relating to coordinating information across different windows to providing overview plus details. A problem for any Information access Interface is an inherent limit in how many kinds of information can be shown at once. Information access systems must always reserve room for a text display area, and this must take up a significant proportion of screen space in order for the text to be legible. A tool within a paint program, for example, can be made quite small while nevertheless remaining recognizable and usable. For legibility reasons, it is difficult to compress many of the information displays needed for an Information access system (such 312        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION as lists of thesaurus terms, query specifications, and lists of saved titles) in this manner. Good layout, graphics, and font design can improve the situation; for example, Web search results can look radically different depending on spacing, font, and other small touches [580]. Overlapping windows provide flexibility in arrangement, but can quickly lead to a crowded, disorganized display. Researchers have observed that much user activity is characterized by movement from one set of functionally related windows to another. Bannon et al. [54] define the notion of a workspace ó the grouping together of sets of windows known to be functionally related to some activity or goal ó arguing that this kind of organization more closely matches users' goal structure than individual windows [96]. Card et al. [140] also found that window usage could be categorized according to a 'working set' model. They looked at the relationship between the demands of the task and the number of windows in use, and found the largest number of individual windows were in use when users transitioned from one task to another. Based on these and other observations, Henderson and Card [420] built a system intended to make it easier for users to move between 'multiple virtual workspaces" [96]. The system uses a 3D spatial metaphor, where each workspace is a 'room,' and users transition between workspaces by 'moving' through virtual doors. By 'traveling' from one room to the next, users can change from one work context to another. In each work context, the application programs and data files that are associated with that work context are visible and readily available for reopening and perusal. The workspace notion as developed by Card et al. also emphasizes the importance of having sessions persist across time. The user should be able to leave a room dedicated to some task, work on another task, and three days later return to the first room and see all of the applications still in the same state as before. This notion of bundling applications and data together for each task has since been widely adopted by window manager software in workstation operating system interfaces. Elastic windows [428] is an extension to the workspace or rooms notion to the organization of 2D tiled windows. The main idea is to make the transition easier from one role or task to another, by adjusting how much of the screen real estate is consumed by the current role. The user can enlarge an entire group of windows with a simple gesture, and this resizing automatically causes the rest of the workspaces to reduce in size so they all still fit on the screen without overlap.
mir-0214	10.8.3    Example Systems The following sections describe the information layout and management approaches taken by several modern information access interfaces. The InfoGrid Layout The InfoGrid system [667] is a typical example of a monolithic layout for an information access interface.   The layout assumes a large display is available INTERFACE SUPPORT FOR THE SEARCH PROCESS         313 Search Parameters		Property Sheet Document Text Control Panel	Thumbnail Images Holding Area		Search Paths Control Panel Table of Contents	TOC Subset Document Text Search Parameters Figure 10.28     Diagrams of monolithic layouts for information access interfaces. and is divided into a left-hand and right-hand side (see Figure 10.28). The left-hand side is further subdivided into an area at the top that contains structured entry forms for specifying the properties of a query, a column of iconic controls lining the left side, and an area for retaining documents of interest along the bottom. The main central area is used for the viewing of retrieval results, either as thumbnail representations of the original documents, or derived organizations of the documents, such as Scatter/Gather-style cluster results. Users can select documents from this area and store them in the holding area below or view them in the right-hand side. Most of the right-hand side of the display is used for viewing selected documents, with the upper portion showing metadata associated with the selected document. The area below the document display is intended to show a graphical history of earlier interactions. Designers must make decisions about which kinds of information to show in the primary view(s). If InfoGrid were used on a smaller display, either the document viewing area or the retrieval results viewing area would probably have to be shown via a pop-up overlapping window; otherwise the user would have to toggle between the two views. If the system were to suggest terms for relevance feedback, one of the existing views would have to be supplanted with this information or a pop-up window would have to be used to display the candidate terms. The system does not provide detailed information for source selection, although this could be achieved in a very simple way with a pop-up menu of choices from the control panel. The SuperBook Layout The layout of the InfoGrid is quite similar to that of SuperBook (see section 10.6). The main difference is that SuperBook retains the table of contents-like display in the main left-hand pane, along with indicators of how many documents containing search hits occur in each level of the outline. Like InfoGrid, the main pane of the right-hand side is used to display selected documents. Query 314        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION formulation is done just below the table of contents view (although in earlier versions this appeared in a separate window). Terms related to the user's query are shown in this window as well Large images appear in pop-up overlapping windows. The SuperBook layout is the result of several cycles of iterative design [481]. Earlier versions used overlapping windows instead of a monolithic layout, allowing users to sweep out a rectangular area on the screen in order to create a new text box. This new text box had its own set of buttons that allowed users to jump to occurrences of highlighted words in other documents or to the table of contents. SuperBook was redesigned after noting results of experimental studies [350, 532] showing that users can be more efficient if given fewer, well chosen interaction paths, rather than allowing wide latitude (A recent study of auditory interfaces found that although users were more efficient with a more flexible interface, they nevertheless preferred the more rigid, predictable interface [801]). The designers also took careful note of log files of user interactions. Before the redesign, users had to choose to view the overall frequency of a hit, move the mouse to the table of contents window, click the button and wait for the results to be updated. Since this pattern was observed to occur quite frequently, in the next version of the interface, the system was redesigned to automatically perform this sequence of actions immediately after a search was run. The SuperBook designers also attempted a redesign to allow the interface to fit into smaller displays. The redesign made use of small, overlapping windows. Some of the interaction sequences that were found useful in this more constrained environment were integrated into later designs for large monolithic displays. The digital library1TE Interface The digital library1TE system [193, 192] makes a number of interesting design choices. It splits functionality into two parts: control of the search process and display of results . The control portion is a graphical direct manipulation display with animation (see Figure 10.29). Queries, sources, documents, and groups of retrieved documents are represented as graphical objects.   The user creates a query by filling out the editable fields within a query constructor object.   The system manufactures a query object, which is represented by a small icon which can be dragged and dropped onto iconic representations of collections or search services. If a service is active, it responds by creating an empty results set object and attaching the query to this. A set of retrieval results is represented as a circular pool, and documents within the result set are represented as icons distributed along the perimeter of the pool. Documents can be dragged out of the results set pool and dropped into other services, such as a document summarizer or a language translator. Meanwhile, the user can make a copy of the query icon and drop it onto another search service. Placing the mouse over the iconic representation of the query causes a 'tool-tips* window to pop up to show the contents of the underlying query. Queries can be stored and reused at a later time, thusgt; facilitating retention of previously successful search strategies. INTERFACE SUPPORT FOR THE SEARCH PROCESS        315 Figure 10.29     The digital libraryITE interface [193]. A flexible interface architecture frees the user from the restriction of a rigid order of commands. On the other hand, as seen in the SuperBook discussion, such an architecture must provide guidelines, to help get the user started, give hints about valid ways to proceed, and prevent the user from making errors. The graphical portion of the digital libraryITE interface makes liberal use of animation to help guide the user. For example, if the user attempts to drop a query in the document summarizer icon ó an illegal operation ó rather than failing and giving the user an accusatory error message [185], the system takes control of the object being dropped, refusing to let it be placed on the representation for the target application, and moves the object left, right, and left again, mimicking a cshake-the-head-no' gesture. Animation is also used to help the user understand the state of the system, for example, in showing the progress of the retrieval of search results by moving the result set object away from the service from which it was invoked. digital libraryITE uses a separate Web browser window for the display of detailed information about the retrieved documents, such as their bibliographic citations and their full text. The browser window is also used to show Scatter/Gather-style cluster results and to allow users to select documents for relevance feedback. Earlier designs of the system attempted to incorporate text display into the direct manipulation portion, but this was found to be infeasible because of the space required [192]. Thus, digital libraryITE separates the control portion of the information access process from the scanning and reading portion. This separation allows for reusable query construction and service selection, while at the same time allowing for a legible view of documents and relationships among retrieved documents. The selection in the display view is linked to the graphical control portion, so a document viewed in the display could be used as part of a query in a query constructor. 316        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION digital libraryITE also incorporates the notion of a workspace, or 'workcenter,' as it is known in this system. Different workspaces are created for different kinds of tasks. For example, a workspace for buying computer software can be equipped with source icons representing good sources of reviews of computer software, good Web sites to search for price information and link to the user's online credit service. The SketchTrieve Interface The guiding principle behind the SketchTrieve interface [365] is the depiction of information access as an informal process, in which half-finished ideas and partly explored paths can be retained for later use, saved and brought back to compare to later interactions, and the results can be combined via operations on graphical objects and connectors between them. It has been observed [584, 722] that users use the physical layout of information within a spreadsheet to organize information. This idea motivates the design of SketchTrieve, which allows users to arrange retrieval results in a side-by-side manner to facilitate comparison and recombination (see Figure 10.30). The notion of a canvas or workspace for the retention of the previous context should be adopted more widely in future. Many issues are not easily solved, such as how to show the results of a set of interrelated queries, with minor modifications based on query expansion, relevance feedback, and other forms of modification.  One idea is to show sets of related retrieval results as a stack of 1 John a-.:-- .5 wortt!.: Jotno ar 'iM f _*t.ps pro^t    : .1 h jv.*i:_: ': be lock::!.;:* Figure 10.30     The SketchTYieve interface [365].

mir-0215	10.8.4    Examples of Poor Use of Overlapping Windows Sometimes conversion from a command-line-based interface to a graphical display can cause problems. Hancock-Beaulieu et al [337] describe poor design decisions made in an overlapping windows display for a bibliographic system. (An improvement was found with a later redesign of the system that used a monolithic interface [336].) Problems can also occur when designers make a literal' transformation from a TTY interface to a graphical interface. The consequences can be seen in the current LEXIS-NEXIS interface, which does not make use of the fact that window systems allow the user to view different kinds of information simultaneously. Instead, despite the fact that it occupies the entire screen, the interface does not retain window context when the user switches from one function to another. For example, viewing a small amount of metadata about a list of retrieved titles causes the list of results to disappear, rather than overlaying the information with a pop-up window or rearranging the available space with resizable tiles. Furthermore, this metadata is rendered in poorly-format ted ASCII instead of using the bit-map capabilities of a graphical interface. When a user opts to see the full text view of a document, it is shown in a small space, a few paragraphs at a time, instead of expanding to fill the entire available space.
mir-0216	10.8.5    Retaining Search History Section 10.3 discusses information seeking strategies and behaviors that have been observed by researchers in the field. This discussion suggests that the user interface should show what the available choices are at any given point, as well as what moves have been made in the past, short-terrn tactics as well as longer-term strategies, and allow the user to annotate the choices made and information found along the way. Users should be able to bundle search sessions as well as save individual portions of a given search session, and flexibly access and modify each. There is also increasing interest in incorporating personal preference and usage information both into formulation of queries and use of the results of search [277]. For the most part these strategies are not supported well in current user interfaces; however some mechanisms have been introduced that begin to address these needs. In particular, mechanisms to retain prior history of the search are useful for these tasks. Some kind of history mechanism has been made available in most search systems in the past. Usually these consist of a list of the commands executed earlier. More recently, graphical history has been introduced, that allows tracking of commands and results as well. Kim and Hirtle 318        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION Figure 10.31     The VISAGE interaction history visualization [685]. [440] present a summary of graphical history presentation mechanisms. Recently, a graphical interface that displays Web page access history in a hierarchical structure was found to require fewer page accesses and require less time when returning to pages already visited [370]. An innovation of particular interest for information access interfaces is exemplified by the saving of state in miniature form in a 'slide sorter' view as exercised by the VISAGE system for information visualization [685] (see Figure 10.31). The VISAGE application has the added advantage of being visual in nature and so individual states are easier to recognize. Although intended to be used as a presentation creation facility, this interface should also be useful for retaining search action history.
mir-0217	10.8.6    Integrating Scanning, Selection, and Querying User interfaces for information access in general do not do a good job of supporting strategies, or even of sequences of movements from one operation to the next. Even something as simple as taking the output of retrieval results from one query and using them as input to another query executed in a later search session is not well supported in most interfaces. Hertzum and Frokjaer [368] found that users preferred an integration of scanning and query specification in their user interfaces. They did not, however, observe better results with such interactions. They hypothesized that if interactions are too unrestricted this can lead to erroneous or wasteful behavior, and interaction between two different modes requires more guidance. This suggests that more flexibility is needed, but within constraints (this argument was also made in the discussion of the SuperBook system in section 10.6). There are exceptions. The new Web version of the Melyvl system provides ways to take the output of one query and modify it later for re-execution (see Figure 10.32), The workspace-based systems such as digital libraryITE and Rooms allow storage and reuse of previous state. However, these systems do not integrate the general search process well with scanning and selection of information from auxiliary structures. Scanning, selection, and querying needs to be better integrated in general This discussion will conclude with an example of an interface that does attempt to tightly couple querying and browsing.

Copyright ©, The Regents of the University of California. The Cat-a-Cone interface integrates querying and browsing of very large category hierarchies with their associated text collections. The prototype system uses 3D-f animation interface components from the Information Visualizer [144], applied in a novel way, to support browsing and search of text collections and their category hierarchies. See Figure 10.33. A key component of the interface is the separation of the graphical representation of the category hierarchy from the graphical representation of the documents. This separation allows for a fluid, flexible interaction between browsing and search, and between categories and documents. It also provides a mechanism by which a set of categories associated with a document can be viewed along with their hierarchical context. Another key component of the design is assignment of first-class status to the representation of text content. The retrieved documents are stored in a 3D-hanimation book representation [144] that allows for compact display of moderate numbers of documents. Associated with each retrieved document is a page of links to the category hierarchy and a page of text showing the document contents. The user can "ruffle' the pages of the book of retrieval results and see corresponding changes in the category hierarchy, which is also represented in 3D+animation. All and only those parts of the category space that reflect the semantics of the retrieved document are shown with the document. The system allows for several different kinds of starting points. Users can start by typing in a name of a category and seeing which parts of the category hierarchy match it. For example, Figure 10.34 shows the results of searching on 320        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION I".

The hierarchy immediately shows why "Radiation' appears under Diseases ó as part of a subtree on occupational hazards. Now the user can select one or more of these category labels as input to a query specification. Another way the user can start is by simply typing in a free text query into an entry label. This query is matched against the collection. Relevant documents are retrieved and placed in the book format. When the user "opens* the book to a retrieved document, the parts of the category hierarchy that correspond to the retrieved documents are shown in the hierarchical representation. Thus, multiple intersecting categories can be shown simultaneously. In their hierarchical context. Thus, this interface fluidly combines large, complex metadata, starting points, scanning, and querying Into one Interface. The interface allows for a kind of relevance feedback, by suggesting additional categories that are related to the documents that have been retrieved. This interaction model is similar to that proposed by [5]. Recall the evaluation of the Kohonen feature map representation discussed in section 10.4. The experimenters found that some users expressed a desire for a visible hierarchical organization, others wanted an ability to zoom in on a subarea to get more detail and some* users disliked having to look through the entire map to find a theme, desiring an alphabetical ordering instead. The subjects liked the ease of being able to jump from one area to another without TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        321 EZEZJ-SH3  Figure 10.34     An interface for a starting point for searching over category labels [358]. having to back up (as is required in Yahoo!) and liked the fact that the maps have varying levels of granularity. These results all support the design decisions made in the Cat-a-Cone. Hierarchical representation of term meanings is supported, so users can choose which level of description is meaningful to them. Furthermore, different levels of description can be viewed simultaneously, so more familiar concepts can be viewed in more detail, and less familiar at a more general level An alphabetical ordering of the categories coupled with a regular expression search mechanism allows for straightforward location of category labels. Retrieved documents are represented as first-class objects, so full text is visible, but in a compact form. Category labels are disambiguated by their ancestor/descendant/sibling representation. Users can jump easily from one category to another and can in addition query on multiple categories simultaneously (something that is not a natural feature of the maps). The Cat-a-Cone has several additional advantages as well. such as allowing a document to be placed at the intersection of several categories, and explicitly linking document contents with the category representation.
mir-0218	10.9    Trends and Research Issues The importance of human computer interaction is receiving increasing recognition within the field of computer science [5871.  As should be evident from the 322        USER INTERFACES AND VISUALIZATION contents of this chapter, the role of the user interface in the information access process has only recently begun to receive the attention it deserves. Research in this area can be expected to increase rapidly, primarily because of the rise of the Web. The Web has suddenly made vast quantities of information available globally, leading to an increase in interest in the problem of information access. This has lead to the creation of new information access paradigms, such as the innovative use of relevance feedback seen in the Amazon.com interface. Because the Web provides a platform-independent user interface, investment in better user interface design can have an impact on a larger user population than before. Another trend that can be anticipated is an amplified interest in organization and search over personal information collections. Many researchers are proposing that in future a person's entire life will be recorded using various media, from birth to death. One motivation for this scenario is to enable searching over everything a person has ever read or written. Another motivation is to allow for searching using contextual clues, such as cfmd the article I was reading in the meeting I had on May 1st with Pam and Hal'. If this idea is pursued, it will require new, more sophisticated interfaces for searching and organizing a huge collection of personal information. There is also increasing interest in leveraging the behavior of individuals and groups, both for rating and assessing the quality of information items, and for suggesting starting points for search within information spaces. Recommender systems can be expected to increase in prevalence and diversity. User interfaces will be needed to guide users to appropriate recommended items based on their information needs. The field of information visualization needs some new ideas about how to display large, abstract information spaces intuitively. Until this happens, the role of visualization in information access will probably be primarily confined to providing thematic overviews of topic collections and displaying large category hierarchies dynamically. Breakthroughs in information visualization can be expected to have a strong impact on information access systems.

mir-0221	11.1    Introduction The need for an integrated management for multimedia data is rapidly growing in several application environments such as offices, CAD/CAM applications, and medical applications. For this reason, multimedia information systems are widely recognized to be one of the most promising fields in the area of information management. The most important characteristic of a multimedia information system is the variety of data it must be able to support. Multimedia systems must have the capability to store, retrieve, transport, and present data with very heterogeneous characteristics such as text, images (both still and moving), graphs, and sound. For this reason, the development of a multimedia system is considerably more complex than a traditional information system. Conventional systems only deal with simple data types, such as strings or integers. On the contrary, the underlying data model, the query language, and the access and storage mechanisms of a multimedia system must be able to support objects with a very complex structure. The need then arises for developing Multimedia Information Retrieval (Multimedia IB. for short) systems specifically for handling multimedia data. Traditional IR systems (see Chapter 2) only deal with textual unstructured data; therefore, they are unable to support the mix of structured and unstructured data, and different kinds of media, typical of a Multimedia IR system. For instance, a traditional IR system does not support metadata information such as that provided by database schema, which is a fundamental component in a database management system (DBMS). On the other hand, Multimedia IR systems require some form of database schema because several multimedia applications need to structure their data at least partially. However, the notion of schema may need to be weakened with respect to the traditional notion to ensure a higher degree of flexibility in structuring data.   Moreover, 325 326        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES a Multimedia IR system requires handling metadata which is crucial for data retrieval, whereas traditional IR systems do not have such requirement. The architecture of a Multimedia IR system depends on two main factors: first, the peculiar characteristics of multimedia data, and second, the kinds of operations to be performed on such data. In what follows, we briefly deal with both these aspects. Data Modeling A Multimedia IR system should be able to represent and store multimedia objects in a way that ensures their fast retrieval. The system should be therefore able to deal with different kinds of media and with semi-structured data, i.e., data whose structure may not match, or only partially match, the structure prescribed by the data schema. In order to represent semi-structured data, the system must typically extract some features from the multimedia objects. A related issue is how these features are extracted and efficiently maintained by the system. Data Retrieval The main goal of a Multimedia IR system is to efficiently perform retrieval based on user requests, exploiting not only data attributes, as in traditional DBMSs, but also the content of multimedia objects. This poses several interesting challenges, due to the heterogeneity of data, the fuzziness of information, the loss of information in the creation of indexes, and the need of an interactive refinement of the query result. Data retrieval relies on the following basic steps: (1)   Query specification.   In this step, the user specifies the request.   The query interface should allow the user to express fuzzy predicates for proximity searches (for example, "Find all images similar to a car"), content-based predicates (for example, 'Find multimedia objects containing an apple'), conventional predicates on the object attributes (for example, conditions on the attribute 'color of an image, such as 'Find all red images"), and structural predicates (for example, vFind ail multimedia objects containing a video clip'). (2)  Query processing and optimization. Similarly to traditional systems, the query is parsed and compiled into an internal form. In generating this internal representation, the query is also optimized, choosing the best evaluation plan. Note that, due to the presence of fuzzy terms, content-based predicates, and structural predicates, query processing is a very complex activity. A great amount of work has been done on query processing both in traditional [402] and spatial databases [247, 82, 118, 361, 623].  However, little work lias been done on query processing strategies for multimedia databases. The main problem is the heterogeneity of data: different query processing strategies, one for each data type, should be combined together in some wav. INTRODUCTION        327 (3)  Query answer. The retrieved objects are returned to the user in decreasing order of relevance. Relevance is measured as a distance function from the query object to the stored ones. (4)  Query iteration. In traditional DBMSs, the query process ends when the system returns the answer to the user.  In a Multimedia IR system, due to the inevitable lack of precision in the user request, the query execution is iterated until the user is satisfied.   At each iteration the user supplies the system with additional information by which the request is refined, reducing or increasing the number of returned answers. From the previous discussion it follows that a Multimedia IR system differs from a traditional IR system in two main aspects. First, the structure of multimedia objects is more complex than the structure of typical textual data, handled by traditional IR systems. This complexity requires the integration of traditional IR technology with the technology of multimedia database management systems to adequately represent, manage, and store multimedia objects. Note that the use of a DBMS also provides update functionalities and transaction management which are in general not covered by typical IR systems. Second, object retrieval is mainly based on a similarity approach. Moreover, the objects retrieved by a query are usually returned to the user in a ranked form. These aspects are successfully handled by IR techniques (see Chapter 2). However, IR systems have initially been developed to support libraries of articles, journals, and encyclopedic knowledge bases (see Chapter 2). In those systems, the fundamental unit is the textual document Thus, the techniques developed for traditional IR systems should be extended to deal with documents containing other media. Multimedia IR systems should therefore combine both the DBMS and the IR technology, to integrate the data modeling capabilities of DBMSs with the advanced and similarity-based query capabilities of IR systems. The resulting system will be able to answer attribute-based queries as well as content-based queries. The whole architecture of the resulting system, in particular the query optimizer, must take this aspect into account in order to efficiently support user requests. In this chapter, we discuss modeling and query language issues for multimedia objects, pointing out the differences and the analogies between a traditional IR system and a multimedia one. Problems related to feature extraction and searching are covered by Chapter 12. The first part of the chapter is devoted to the presentation of the most relevant models proposed in the literature for multimedia data, with particular attention to commercial proposals. The second part of the chapter investigates the peculiarities of multimedia query languages with respect to traditional ones. Then, as an example, two different language proposals are presented. Also in this case, we focus on commercial proposals and we discuss how the new standard SQL3 could be iLsed to deal with multimedia data retrieval. 328        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES
mir-0222	11.2    Data Modeling As we have already remarked, the complex nature of multimedia data may benefit from the use of DBMS functions for data representation and querying. However, the integration of multimedia data in a traditional DBMS is not an easy task. Indeed, traditional DBMSs are mainly targeted to support conventional data. Multimedia data is inherently different from conventional data. The main difference is that information about the content of multimedia data are usually not encoded into attributes provided by the data schema (structured data). Rather, text, image, video, and audio data are typically unstructured. Therefore, specific methods to identify and represent content features and semantic structures of multimedia data are needed. Another distinguishing feature of multimedia data is its large storage requirements. One single image usually requires several Kbytes of storage, whereas a single second of video can require several Mbytes of storage. Moreover, the content of multimedia data is difficult to analyze and compare, in order to be actively used during query processing. Addressing data modeling issues in the framework of Multimedia IR systems entails two main tasks. First, a data model should be defined by which the user can specify the data to be stored into the system. Such a data model should have the ability of an integrated support for both conventional and multimedia data types and should provide methods to analyze, retrieve, and query such data. Second, the system should provide a model for the internal representation of multimedia data. The definition of such a model is crucial for the efficiency of query processing. As far as the first aspect is concerned, a promising technology with respect to the modeling requirements of multimedia data is the object-oriented one [89]. The richness of the data model provided by OODBMSs makes them more suitable than relational DBMSs for modeling both multimedia data types and their semantic relationships. Moreover, the concept of class can be naturally used to define ad hoc data types for multimedia data in that a class is characterized by both a set of attributes and a set of operations that can be performed on these attributes. Classes can, moreover, be related into inheritance hierarchies, thus allowing the definition of a multimedia class as a specialization of one or more superclasses. However, the performance of OODBMs in terms of storage techniques, query processing, and transaction management is not comparable to that of relational DBMSs. Another drawback of OODBMs is that they are highly non-standard. Indeed, even though a standard language has been defined by the Object Database Management Group (ODMG), very few systems support it. For all the above reasons, a lot of effort lias been devoted to the extension of the relational model with capabilities for modeling complex objects, typical of the object-oriented context. The goal of the so-called object-relational technology is to extend the relational model with the ability of representing complex data types by maintaining, at the same time, the performance and the simplicity of relational DBMSs and related query languages. The possibility of defining abstract data types inside the relational model allows one to define ad hoc data types for multimedia data. For instance, such data typ**s ran provide support for DATA MODELING        329 content-dependent queries. In the following section, we will give some examples of such extensions. The second problem related to data modeling is how multimedia data are represented inside the system. Due to the particular nature of multimedia data, it is not sufBcient to describe it through a set of attributes as usually done with traditional data. Rather, some information should be extracted from the objects and used during query processing. The extracted information is typically represented as a set of features; each multimedia object is therefore internally represented as a list of features, each of which represents a point in a multidimensional space. Multi-at tribute access methods can then be used to index and search for them (see Chapter 12). Features can be assigned to multimedia objects either manually by the user, or automatically by the system. In general, a hybrid approach is used, by which the system determines some of the values and the user corrects or augments them. In both cases, values assigned to some specific features, such as the shape of an image or the style of an audio object, are assigned to the object by comparing the object with some previously classified objects. For instance, to establish whether an image represents a car or a house, the shape of the image is compared with the shapes of already classified cars and houses before taking a decision. Finally, it is important to recall that feature extraction cannot be precise. Therefore, a weight is usually assigned to each feature value representing the uncertainty of assigning such a value to that feature. For example, if we are 80% sure that a shape is a square, we can store this value together with the recognized shape. From the previous discussion, it follows that data modeling in a Multimedia IR system is an articulated activity that must take into account both the complex structure of data and the need of representing features extracted from multimedia objects. In the following, we give a brief overview of some proposals to model multimedia data. We start by reviewing the support for multimedia data provided by commercial DBMSs. Then, as an example of a research proposal we survey the data model developed in the context of the MULTOS project.
mir-0223	11.2.1    Multimedia Data Support In Commercial DBMSs Most current relational DBMSs support variable-length data types which can be used to represent multimedia data. The way these data are supported by commercial DBMSs is mostly non-standard in that each DBMS vendor uses different names for such data types and provides support for different operations on them. For example, the Oracle DBMS provides the VARCHAR2 data type to represent variable length, character strings. The maximum length of VARCHAR2 data is 4000 bytes. The RAW and LONG RAW data types are used for data that is not to be interpreted by Oracle. These data types can be used to store graphics, sounds, or unstructured objects. LOB data types can be used to store Large unstructured data OBjects up to four gigabytes in size. BLOBs are used to store unstructured Binary Large OBjects, whereas CLOBs are used to store Character Large OBject data. 330        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES The Sybase SQL server supports IMAGE and TEXT data types to store images and unstructured text, respectively, and provides a limited set of functions for their searching and manipulation. However, the support provided by the above mentioned data types is very limited in that the DBMS does not provide any interpretation of the data content. Moreover, operations that can be performed on such data by means of the built-in functions provided by the DBMS are very simple. As we have already remarked, most commercial relational DBMSs vendors are investing a lot of effort in extending the relational model with the capability of modeling complex objects, typical of the object-oriented context. Such efforts have given rise to the upcoming SQL3 standard. Prom a data modeling point of view, the major improvement provided by SQL3 with respect to its predecessor SQL-92, is the support for an extensible type system. Extensibility of the type system is achieved by providing constructs to define user-dependent abstract data types, in an object-oriented like manner. In SQL3, each type specification consists of both attribute and function specifications. A strong form of encapsulation is provided, in that attribute values can only be accessed by using some system functions. Moreover, user-defined functions can be either visible from any object or only visible in the object they refer to. Both single and multiple inheritance can be defined among user-defined types and dynamic late binding is provided [89]. SQL3 also provides three types of collection data types: sets, multisets, and lists. The elements of a collection must have compatible types. Several system-defined operations are provided to deal with collections. Besides the definition of user-dependent abstract data types, SQL3 provides a restricted form of object identifier that supports sharing and avoids data duplication. Although SQL3 has not yet been officially published, most commercial products have already implemented their proprietary versions of SQL3. An example in such direction is the data cartridges provided by Oracle for multimedia data handling, or the data blades supported by Illustra.f Oracle provides data cartridges for text, spatial data, image, audio and video data. To give a concrete example, OracleS provides a ConText cartridge, which is a text management solution combining data management capabilities of a traditional DBMS with advanced text retrieval and natural-language process technology. The ConText cartridge supports the most popular document formats, including ASCII, MS Word, and HTML. One of the most relevant feature of the ConText cartridge is its ability to find documents about a specific topic I thus providing a form of content-based retrieval). Content-based queries on text documents can be combined with traditional queries in the same SQL statement and can be efficiently executed due to the use of indexing techniques specific for texts. Such techniques are based on the notion of inverted files (see Chapter 8) which map a given word to the documents containing it, thus allowing a fast retrieval of all the documents containing a particular word. t  Ilhistni 'Aits acquired by Infoniiix in DATA MODELING        331 Illustra provides 3D and 2D spatial data blades for modeling spatial data. The supported data types include boxes, vectors, quadrangles, etc., and examples of supported operations are INTERSECT, CONTAINS, OVERLAPS, CENTER, and so on. Spatial data blades also implement R-trees for performing efficient spatial queries [330, 717]. The text data blade provides data types for representing unstructured text and performing content-based queries. For example, the method ContainWords can be used to search for all the documents containing a particular word. Moreover, Illustra supports a data blade which can be used to query images by content. The object-relational technology and its extensive type system is now starting to be widely used both in industrial and research projects. An example of this trend is the La Scala archive project, currently under development at the Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale of the University of Milano [254]. The goal of this project is the development of the multimedia archive of Teatro alia Scala, one of the best known musical temples of the world, using the Oracle technology and the related data cartridges. The system is organized around La Scala nights. Each night encompasses the phonic items, score, and other graphical and video items related to the performance. When a new performance has to be prepared, the musicians can easily access all the materials (such as CD-ROMs, video, photos, and scores) of previous editions of the same performance. Accessing such information has required the development of ad hoc cartridges to represent and query non-conventional data. For instance, we are currently developing a data cartridge that allows content-based queries on music scores. We apply pattern matching techniques to music scores to enable the user to sing a few bars into a microphone linked to the computer and see all the music scores containing a piece of music close to the one being sung. Users can then view the retrieved musical graphic scores, or excerpts from them, and simultaneously play the corresponding music. As an example of a data model suitable for a multimedia environment, in the following we consider the data model developed in the context of the MULTOS project [759].
mir-0224	11.2.2    The MULTOS Data Model MULTOS (KIULTimedia Office Server) is a multimedia document^ server with advanced document retrieval capabilities, developed in the context of an ESPRIT project in the area of Office Systems [759]. MULTOS is based on a client/server architecture. Three different types of document servers are supported: current servers^ dynamic servers, and archive servers, which differ in storage capacity and document retrieval speed. Such servers support filing and retrieval of multimedia objects based on document collections, document types, document attributes, document text, and images. |  As MULTOS deals with office services, in the following we use the words object and document agt;, svnonvnious. 332        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES The MULTOS data model allows the representation of high level concepts present in the documents contained in the database, the grouping of documents into classes of documents having similar content and structure, and the expression of conditions on free text. Each document is described by a logical structure, a layout structure, and a conceptual structure. The logical structure determines arrangements of logical document components (e.g., title, introduction, chapter, section, etc.). The layout structure deals with the layout of the document content and it contains components such as pages, frames, etc. The conceptual structure allows a semantic-oriented description of the document content as opposed to the syntax-oriented description provided by the logical and layout structure. The conceptual structure has been added to provide support for document retrieval by content. MULTOS provides a formal model, based on a data structuring tool available in semantic data models, to define the document conceptual structure. The logical and layout structures are defined according to the ODA document representation [398]. Documents having similar conceptual structures are grouped into conceptual types. In order to handle types in an effective manner, conceptual types are maintained in a hierarchy of generalization, where a subtype inherits from its supertypes the conceptual structure and can then refine it. Types can be strong or weak. A strong type completely specifies the structure of its instances. A weak type, on the other hand, partially specifies the structure of its instances. Moreover, components of unspecified type (called spring component types) can appear in a document definition. Example 1 The conceptual structure of the type Generic .Letter is shown in Figure 11.1. The node Letter_Body is a spring conceptual component. The complete conceptual structure in Figure 11.2 corresponds to the type BusinessJProductJLetter. This type has been obtained from Generic. Letter by specialization of Letter JBody into a complex conceptual component, defined as an aggregation of five conceptual components. According to the conceptual model the document ^peBusiness_Prodnct_Letter is linked to the document type GenericXetter by an kis-a' relationship. In this example, the iJt' symbol attached to the Receiver component means that it is multivalued. Notice also that the Name and the Address appear in two subtrees having as roots the conceptual components Receiver and Sender, respectively. For document retrieval, conceptual types play the role of the database schema which enables the use of efficient access structures. Moreover, conceptual types are the basis for formulating queries at an abstract level. MULTOS also provides a sophisticated approach to deal with image data. First, an image analysis process is performed, consisting of two phases: low level image analysis and high level image analysis. During the low level image analysis phase, the basic objects composing a given image and their relative positions are identified. The high level image analysis phase deals with image interpretation according to the Dempster-Shaffer theory of evidence [60, 312;. DATA MODELING        333 Document Place Date Receiver+            Sender Name     Address                     Name Street        City     Country      Street        City      Country Figure 11.1     Conceptual structure of the type Generic_Letter.

At the end of the image analysis process, images are described in terms of the objects recognized, with associated belief and plausibility values, and the classes to which they belong. The information is then exploited in image access. Image access information is stored in an image header, associated with the image file. Access structures are then built for a fast access to image headers. Two types of index are constructed: ï  Object index. For each object a list is maintained. Each element of the lists is a pair (BI,IMH), where IMH is a pointer to the header of the image containing the object, and BI is the associated belief interval, representing the probability that the image considered really contains the object. ï  Cluster index. For each image class, a list of pairs (MFJMH) is maintained.  IMH is a pointer to an image header corresponding to an image with a non-null degree of membership to the class, and MF is the value of the membership degree.  The membership degree of an image to a given class is computed by comparing the image interpretation resulting from the analysis phase, with the class description, using techniques analogous to the ones used in text IR systems [698] (see Chapter 6). 334        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES
mir-0225	11.3    Query Languages Queries in relational or object-oriented database systems are based on an exact match mechanism, by which the system is able to return exactly those tuples or objects satisfying some well specified criteria given in the query expression and nothing more. In general, query predicates specify which values the object attributes must contain. Because of the semi-structured nature of multimedia objects, the previous approach is no longer adequate in a Multimedia IR system. In this context, the user should still be able to query the content of multimedia objects by specifying values of semantic attributes but he/she should also be able to specify additional conditions about the content of multimedia data. Thus, the exact match is only one of the possible ways of querying multimedia objects. More often, a similarity-based approach is applied that considers both the structure and the content of the objects. Queries of the latter type are called content-based queries since they retrieve multimedia objects depending on their global content. Information on the global content of an object is not represented as attribute values in the database system. Rather, as we have already remarked in section 11.2, a set of information, called features, is extracted and maintained for each object. When the query is submitted, the features of the query object are matched with respect to the features of the objects stored in the database and only the objects that are more similar to the query one are returned to the user (see Chapter 12). The characteristics of content-based query processing impacts the definition of a multimedia query language and, in general, of the user interface. In particular, in designing a multimedia query language, three main aspects require attention: ï  How the user enters his/her request to the system, i.e., which interfaces are provided to the user for query formulation. ï  Which conditions on multimedia objects can be specified in the user request.  The conditions that can be expressed depend on the support the system provides for content-based retrieval (see Chapter 12). ï  How uncertainty, proximity, and weights impact the design of the query language. In the following, we discuss the above aspects in detail. Then, we present two examples of multimedia query languages. First, we illustrate how traditional relational query languages can be extended to deal with multimedia data, discussing the main characteristics of the upcoming SQL3 query language. Then. as an example of a research proposal, we introduce4 the query language supported by MULTOS (see section 11.2.2). QUERY LANGUAGES        335
mir-0226	11.3.1    Request Specification Two different interfaces can be presented to the user for querying multimedia objects. The first type of interface is based on browsing and navigation. Usually, due to the complex structure of multimedia objects, it may be useful to let users browse and navigate inside the structure of multimedia objects to locate the desired objects. Such an approach is typically used in CAD/CAM/CASE environments due to the complex structure of the objects under consideration. Navigation, however, is not always the best way to find multimedia objects, in that it may be heavily time consuming when the object desired is deeply nested. The second approach for selecting objects is therefore based, as traditionally in DBMSs, on specifying the conditions the objects of interest must satisfy, by means of queries. Queries, in turn, can be specified in two different ways: the first, typical of a traditional database context, is to enter the query by using a specific query language. However, in some cases (especially when images and audio data are considered), a query by example approach is preferred. Under this approach, queries are specified by using actual data inside a visual environment; the user provides the system with an object example that is then used to retrieve all the stored objects similar to the given one. For example, the user may choose a house and pose the query: 'Retrieve all houses of similar shape and different color.' This approach requires the use of a GUI environment where the user can pick examples and compose the query object. In order to pick examples, the system must supply some domains, i.e., sets of typical values, one for each object feature (see section 11.2).
mir-0227	11.3.2    Conditions on Multimedia Data Multimedia query languages should provide predicates for expressing conditions on the attributes, the content, and the structure of multimedia objects.   In general, query predicates can be classified into three different groups: ï  Attribute predicates concern the attributes (i.e., the structured content) of multimedia objects. ï  Structural predicates concern the structure of the data being considered. ï  Semantic predicates concern the semantic and unstructured content of the data involved. By the term attribute predicates we mean predicates against traditional attributes, i.e., attributes for which an exact value is supplied for each object. Examples of attributes are the speaker of an audio object, the size of an object, or its type. By querying these predicates, the system applies an exact-match retrieval, using the same techniques as traditional DBMSs. Structural predicates concern the structure of multimedia objects. Such predicates can be answered by using some form of metadata [99, 442; and 336        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES information about the database schema. With respect to traditional databases, structural queries play a fundamental role in multimedia query processing, due to the complex structure of multimedia objects. An example of use of a structural predicate is the query: 'Find all multimedia objects containing at least one image and a video clip.' On the other hand, semantic predicates concern the semantic content of the queried data, depending on the features that have been extracted and stored for each multimedia object. An example of a semantic query is 'Find all the objects containing the word OFFICE.' Note that the word 'OFFICE' may appear either in a textual component of the object or as a text attribute of some image components. The query 'Find all the red houses' is a query on the image content. This query can be executed only if color and shape are features that have been previously extracted from images. Current systems support semantic predicates only with respect to specific features, such as the color, the shape, the texture, and sometimes the motion. For example, QBIC allows the retrieval of images with similar shapes or similar textures with respect to the object example specified in the query [257]. More innovative approaches include the Name-it project, whose aim is to process a video clip and automatically associate spoken or typed names with their corresponding faces [708]. The main difference between attribute predicates and semantic predicates is that, in the latter case, an exact match cannot be applied. This means that there is no guarantee that the objects retrieved by this type of predicate are 1009? correct or precise. In general, the result of a query involving semantic predicates is a set of objects, each of which has an associated degree of relevance with respect to the query. The user can subsequently select the better matches and submit the query again. Structural and semantic predicates can also refer to spatial or temporal properties of multimedia objects. Spatial semantic predicates specify conditions about the relative positions of a set of objects in an image or a video. Examples of spatial semantic predicates are: contain, intersect, is contained in, is adjacent to. Temporal semantic predicates are mainly related to continuous media, like audio and video. They allow one to express temporal relationships among the various frames of a single audio or video. For example, the query ¶"Fiuci all the objects that contain an audio component, where the hint of the discussion is first policy, and then economy' is a temporal audio query. From the point of view of structural predicates, spatial and temporal predicates can be used to specify temporal synchronization properties and spatial layout properties for the presentation of multimedia objects [87, 88]. For instance, in the query: 'Find all the objects containing an image overlapping the associated text', a spatial structural predicate Is used to impose a condition on the spatial layout of the retrieved objects. Analogously, the query: 'Find all the objects in which a jingle is played for the duration of an linage display1 is an example of a structural temporal query. Note, moreover, that temporal and spatial predicates can be combined to express more articulated requirements. An example Is the query: "Find all the objects in which the logo of a car company QUERY LANGUAGES        337 is displayed and, when it disappears, a graphic showing the increases in the company sales is shown in the same position where the logo was,' Due to the complex structure of multimedia objects, all the previous types of predicates can refer either to the whole object or, if the underlying data model supports complex object representation, to some subcomponents of the object. In the last case, the query language must also be able to navigate the object structure. A typical example in this direction is represented by path expressions in object-oriented systems [89].
mir-0228	11.3.3    Uncertainty, Proximity, and Weights in Query Expressions As we have already remarked, the execution of a content-dependent query returns a set of relevant objects. An interesting aspect in designing a multimedia query language is how it is possible to specify the degree of relevance of the retrieved objects. In general, this can be done in three different ways: ï  By using some imprecise terms and predicates, such as normal, unacceptable, typical. Each of those terms does not represent a precise value but a set of possible acceptable values with respect to which the attribute or the feature has to be matched. ï  By specifying particular proximity predicates.  In this case, the predicate does not represent a precise relationship between objects or between attributes/features and values. Rather, the relationship represented is based on the computation of a semantic distance between the query object and the stored ones, on the basis of the extracted features. The Nearest object search is an example of proximity predicate, by which the user requests all the objects which are closest or within a certain distance of a given object. Indexing support for this kind of query is discussed in Chapter 12. ï  By assigning each condition or term a given weighty specifying the degree of precision by which a condition must be verified by an object. For example, the query 'Find all the objects containing an image representing a screen (HIGH) and a keyboard (LOW)' [657], can be used to retrieve all the objects containing an image representing a screen and a keyboard. However, the objects containing only a screen are also retrieved and returned to the user, after the ones containing both the screen and the keyboard, since the condition imposing the containment of a keyboard is weaker than the condition imposing the containment of a screen. The use of imprecise terms and relationships, as well as the use of weights, allows the user to drive the similarity-based selection of relevant objects. The corresponding query is executed by assigning some importance and preference values to each predicate and term. Then* objects are retrieved and presented to the user as an ordered list. This ordering is given by a score associated with each object, giving a measure of the matching degree between the object and 338        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES the query. The computation of the score is based on probabilistic models, using the preference values assigned to each predicate.
mir-0229	11.3.4    Some Proposals In the following we briefly survey some query languages supporting retrieval of multimedia objects. In order to describe how standard languages are evolving to support multimedia applications, we first describe the facilities provided by the upcoming standard SQL3 to support such kinds of applications. Then, we present the query language supported by the MULTOS system [90], introduced in section 11.2.2. The SQL3 Query Language As we have seen in section 11.2.1, the extensible type system and in general the ability to deal with complex objects make SQL3 suitable for modeling multimedia data. From the query language point of view, the major improvements of SQL3 with respect to SQL-92 can be summarized as follows: ï  Functions and stored procedures.  SQL3 allows the user to integrate external functionalities with data manipulation. This means that functions of an external library can be introduced into a database system as external functions. Such functions can be either implemented by using an external language, and in this case SQL3 only specifies which is the language and where the function can be found, or can be directly implemented by using SQL3 itself. In this way, impedance mismatch between two different programming languages and type systems is avoided. Of course, this approach requires an extension of SQL with imperative programming languages constructs. ï  Active database facilities. Another important property of SQL3 is the support of active rules, by which the database is able to react to some system- or user-dependent events by executing specific actions.   Active rules, or triggers, are very useful to enforce integrity constraints. From the multimedia perspective point of view, the aspects described make SQL3 suitable for being used as an interface language for multimedia applications, in particular, the ability to deal with external functions and user-defined data types enables the language to deal with objects with a complex structure, as multimedia objects. Note that, without this characteristic, the ability to deal with BLOB would have been useless since it reduces the view of multimedia data to single large uninterpreted data values, which are not adequate for the rich semantics of multimedia data. By the use of triggers, spatial and temporal constraints can be enforced, thus preserving the database consistency. Finally, as SQL3 is a widespread standard, it allows one to model multimedia objects in the framework of a well understood technology. QUERY LANGUAGES        339 Though the above facilities make SQL3 suitable for use as an interface for multimedia applications, there are also some limitations. The main drawback is related to retrieval support and, as a consequence, optimization. Indeed, no IR techniques are integrated into the SQL3 query processor. This means that the ability to perform content-based search is application dependent. As a consequence, objects are not ranked and are therefore returned to the application as a unique set. Moreover, specialized indexing techniques can be used but they are not transparent to the user. Bearing in mind the previous limitations, several projects have already been started with the aim of integrating SQL3 with IR facilities. An example of such a project is represented by SQL/MM Pull Text [190]. Text is in this case considered as a nested sequence of words, sentences, and paragraphs. In order to precisely capture the structure and the meaning of the words, SQL/MM Full Text is also able to view the text as a tree structure entity. The structure of this entity is controlled by a grammar. These facilities allow one to easily express queries to perform selection on the basis of the text content and/or text structure. There have also been several proposals for introducing spatial data types and predicates into the SQL framework. Among them, we recall Probe [623], Spatial SQL [231], Pictorial SQL [687], and QBE [418]. The MULTOS Query Language The development of the MULTOS query language has been driven by a number of requirements: first, it should be possible to easily navigate through the document structure. Path-names can be used for this purpose. Path-names can be total, if the path identifies only one component, or partial, if several components are identified by the path. Path-names are similar to object-oriented path expressions. Queries both on the content and on document structure must be supported. Query predicates on complex components must be supported. In this case, the predicate applies to all the document subcomponents that have a type compatible with the type required by the query. This possibility is very useful when a user does not recall the structure of a complex component. In general, a MULTOS query has the form: FIND DOCUMENTS VERSION version-clause SCOPE scope-clause TYPE type-clause WHERE condition-clause WITH component where: The version-clause specifies which versions of the documents should be considered by the query. 340        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES Æ The scope-clause restricts the query to a particular set of documents. This set of documents is either a user-defined document collection or a set of documents retrieved by a previous query. ï  The type-clause allows the restriction of a query to documents belonging to a prespecifled set of types. The conditions expressed by the condition-clause only apply to the documents belonging to these types and their subtypes. When no type is specified, the query is applied to all document types. Æ The condition-clause is a Boolean combination of simple conditions (i.e., predicates) on documents components. Predicates are expressed on conceptual components of documents. Conceptual components are referenced by path-names. The general form of a predicate is: component restriction where component is a path-name and restriction is an operator followed by an expression. ï  The with-clause allows one to express structural predicates. Component is a path-name and the clause looks for all documents structurally containing such a component. Different types of conditions can be specified in order to query different types of media. In particular, MULTOS supports three main classes of predicates: predicates on data attributes, on which an exact match search is performed; predicates on textual components, determining all objects containing some specific strings; and predicates on images, specifying conditions on the image content. Image predicates allow one to specify conditions on the class to which an image should belong or conditions on the existence of a specified object within an image and on the number of occurrences of an object within an image. The following example illustrates the basic features of the MULTOS query language. Example 2  Consider the conceptual structure GenericJLetter, presented in example 1.  The following is an example of query: FIND DOCUMENT VERSIONS LAST WHERE Document.Date gt;  1/1/1998 AND (*Sendei\Name = "Olivetti" OR *Product_Presentation CONTAINS  "Olivetti")  AMD *ProdTict_Description CONTAINS  "Personal Computer11  AND (?Address.Country =  "Italy"  OR TEXT CONTAINS  "Italy")  AND WITH *Company_Logo. According to this query, the user looks for the last version of all documents, dated after January 1998, containing a company logo, having the word 'Olivetti' either as sender name or in the product presentation (which is a textual component), with the word 'Personal Computer' in the product description section TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        341 (which is another textual component) and with the word 'Italy' either constituting the country in the address or contained in any part of the entire document. Symbol '*' indicates that the path-name is not complete, that is, it could identify more than one component. The query language provided by MULTOS also supports the specification of imprecise queries that can be used when the user has an uncertain knowledge about the content of the documents he/she is seeking [657]. Such uncertainty is expressed by associating both a preference and an importance value with the attributes in the query. Such values are then used for ranking the retrieved documents. The following example illustrates the discussion. Example 3  The query: FIND DOCUMENT VERSIONS LAST WHERE (Document.Date BETWEEN   (12/31/1998,1/31/98)   PREFERRED BETWEEN   (2/1/1998,2/15/98)   ACCEPTABLE)   HIGH AND (*Sender.Name =  "Olivetti"  OR *Product_Presentation CONTAINS "Olivetti") HIGH AND (*ProductJ)escription CONTAINS "Personal Computer") HIGH AND (*ProductJDescription CONTAINS "good ergonomics") LOW AND (?Address.Country = "Italy" OR TEXT CONTAINS "Italy") HIGH AND WITH *CompanyJLogo HIGH (IMAGE MATCHES screen HIGH keyboard HIGH AT LEAST 2 floppy .drives LOW)  HIGH finds the last versions of all documents written in January, but possibly even at the beginning of February 1998, containing a company logo, having the word 'Olivetti' either as sender name or in the product presentation, with the word 'Personal Computer' in the product description section, and with the word 'Italy' either constituting the country in the address or contained in any part of the entire document. Personal Computers are described in the product description section as products having good ergonomics. Moreover, the document should contain a picture of the Personal Computer, complete with screen and keyboard, with at least two floppy drives. The value fL0W3 associated with the condition on 'good ergonomics7 indicates that the user formulating the query is not completely sure about this description of PC. By contrast, he/she is sure of all the conditions whose associated value is HIGH.7
mir-0230	11.4    Trends and Research Issues In this chapter we have discussed the main issues in developing a Multimedia IR system. We have observed that only the integration of DBMS and IR technologies provides the ability to represent, store, and manipulate multimedia data and, at the same time, to retrieve those data by applying content-based searches. 342        MULTIMEDIA IR: MODELS AND LANGUAGES We then discussed the main issues arising in defining a data model for multimedia data. Since multimedia data has, in general, a complex structure, the data model must be able to reflect and manage this complexity. Object-oriented or object-relational data models represent the right technology for multimedia data representation. Additional relevant requirements include the support of semi-structured data and metadata. Another important requirement is the ability to internally represent the content of multimedia data in a way that ensures fast retrieval of the stored data and efficient processing of content-based queries. To achieve this goal, semantic features can be extracted from the data, stored inside the system, and used during query processing. The second topic discussed in this chapter is related to multimedia query languages. We observed that a multimedia query language is characterized by the type of interface presented to the user and the types of predicates it allows in a query. Such predicates are used to perform content-based searches and to let the user drive the selection of relevant objects. Examples of commercial and prototype systems have been discussed, with respect to the data modeling and query language capabilities. Several aspects require further investigation. For example, even though SQL3 supports multimedia data representation, it cannot be taken as the basis for the definition of a Multimedia IR system. Additional research is needed to integrate SQL3 with specific language constructs and underlying techniques to perform information retrieval and query optimization. Another topic is related to XML (see Chapter 6), the new standard format for data on the Web [304]. XML is a text-based format, providing a standard data model to encode the content, the semantics, and the schema of ordinary documents, structured records, and metacontent information about a Web site. The extension of such a standard to support multimedia data and content-based queries is an important research direction. A further direction concerns the techniques for ranking the objects returned by a partial-match query. Such ranking usually only takes into account the degree of similarity of the objects retrieved with the query request. However, other factors can be considered, such as the profile of the user submitting the query, or the history of the previous queries specified by the user. Taking into account these aspects is very important, since it gives rise to a customized ranking which is closer to the user needs.
mir-0231	11.5    Bibiographic Discussion As we have seen, due to their complex nature, the object-oriented paradigm seems the right approach to model multimedia data.    Details about object-oriented database models and architectures can be found in [89].   The object database standard, as defined by the Object Database Management Group, is presented in [150]. On the research side, several models have been proposed for multimedia BIBIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        343 data. Such proposals range from data models suitable for a particular media type, like data models for videos [211, 238, 297, 621], data models for images [170] or models for spatial data [623], to general-purpose multimedia data models [169, 296, 397, 545, 759, 827]. Issues related to the definition and the classification of metadata in the multimedia context are extensively discussed in [99, 442]. Among the systems supporting similarity-based queries, we recall QBIC [257], Name-It [708], QBE [418], Probe [623], and PICQUERY [418]. For additional details about video and image multimedia databases we refer the reader to [405] and [438], respectively. Details about modeling and architectural aspects of the MULTOS system can be found in [759].
mir-0233	12.1    Introduction The problem we focus on here is the design of fast searching methods that will search a database of multimedia objects to locate objects that match a query object, exactly or approximately. Objects can be two-dimensional color images, gray-scale medical images in 2D or 3D (e.g., MRI brain scans), one-dimensional time series, digitized voice or music, video clips, etc. A typical query by content would be, e.g., 'zn a collection of color photographs, find ones with the same color distribution as a sunset photograph.' Specific applications include image databases; financial, marketing and production time series; scientific databases with vector fields; audio and video databases; DNA/Genorne databases; etc. In such databases, typical queries would be ''find companies whose stock prices move similarly," or 'find images that look like a sunset^ or cfind medical X-rays that contain something that has the texture of a tumor.'' Searching for similar patterns in such databases as the above is essential, because it helps in predictions, computer-aided medical diagnosis and teaching, hypothesis testing and, in general, in 'data mining' [8] and rule discovery. Of course, the distance of two objects has to be quantified. We rely on a domain expert to supply such a distance function Definition      Given two objects, O\ and 02, the distance (= dissimilarity) of the two objects is denoted by Tgt;(OuO2)                                                                                    (12.1) For example, if the objects are two (equal-lengt.h) time series, the distance V{) could be their Euclidean distance (the root of the sum of squared differences). Similarity queries can been classified into two categories; 345 346        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING ï  Whole match Given a collection of N objects Oi, 0%,..., On and a query object Q, we want to find those data objects that are within distance s from Q. Notice that the query and the objects are of the same type: for example, if the objects are 512 x 512 gray-scale images, so is the query. ï  Sub-pattern match Here the query is allowed to specify only part of the object. Specifically, given N data objects (e.g., images) Oi, O2, ï ï ï, On, a query (sub-)object Q and a tolerance £, we want to identify the parts of the data objects that match the query.   If the objects are, e.g., 512x512 gray-scale images (like medical X-rays), in this case the query could be, e.g., a 16x16 subpattern (e.g., a typical X-ray of a tumor). Additional types of queries include the cnearest neighbors" queries (e.g., 'find the five most similar stocks to IBM's stock9) and the 'all pairs'' queries or "spatial joins' (e.g., 'report all the pairs of stocks that are within distance e from each other'). Both the above types of queries can be supported by the approach we describe next. As we shall see, we reduce the problem into searching for multi-dimensional points, which will be organized in R-trees; in this case, nearest-neighbor search can be handled with a branch-and-bound algorithm and the spatial join query can be handled with recent, highly fine-tuned algorithms, as discussed in section 12.8. Thus, we do not focus on nearest-neighbor and 'all-pairs' queries. For all the above types of queries, the ideal method should fulfill the following requirements: ï  It should be fast. Sequential scanning and distance calculation with each and every object will be too slow for large databases. ï  It should be 'correct'  In other words, it should return all the qualifying objects, without missing any (i.e., no 'false dismissals'). Notice that 'false alarms" are acceptable, since they can be discarded easily through a postprocessing step.    Of course, as we see, e.g. in Figure 12.5, we try to keep their number low (but not necessarily minimal), so that the total response time is minimized. ï  The ideal method should require a small space overhead. ï  The method should be dynamic.  It should be easy to insert, delete, and update objects. As we see next, the heart of the presented 'GEMINI* approach is to use / feature extraction functions to map objects into points in /-dimensional space; thus, we can use highly fine-tuned database spatial access methods to accelerate the search. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 12.2 gives some background material on past related work on spatial access methods.

mir-0234	12.2    Background ó Spatial Access Methods As mentioned earlier, the idea is to map objects into points in /-D space, and to use multiattribute access methods (also referred to as spatial access methods or SAMs)  to cluster them and to search for them. Thus, a brief introduction to multidimensional indexing methods (or spatial access methods) is in order. The prevailing methods form three classes: (1) R*-trees and the rest of the R-tree family,   (2) linear quadtrees, and (3) grid-files. Several of these methods explode exponentially with the dimensionality, eventually reducing to sequential scanning. For linear quadtrees, the effort is proportional to the hypersurface of the query region [244]; the hypersurface grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Grid files face similar problems, since they require a directory that grows exponentially with the dimensionality. The R-tree-based methods seem to be most robust for higher dimensions, provided that the fanout of the R-tree nodes remains gt; 2. Below, we give a brief description of the R-tree method and its variants, since it is one of the typical representatives of spatial access methods. The R-tree represents a spatial object by its minimum bounding rectangle (MBR). Data rectangles are grouped to form parent nodes, which are recursively grouped, to form grandparent nodes and, eventually, a tree hierarchy. The MBR of a parent node completely contains the MBRs of its children; MBRs are allowed to overlap. Nodes of the tree correspond to disk pages. Disk pages, or 'disk blocks', are consecutive byte positions on the surface of the disk that are typically fetched with one disk access. The goal of the insertion, split, and deletion routines is to give trees that will have good clustering, with few, tight parent MBRs. Figure 12.1 illustrates data rectangles (in black), organized in an R-tree with fanout 3. Figure 12.2 shows the file structure for the same R-tree, where nodes correspond to disk pages. A range query specifies a region of interest, requiring all the data regions that Intersect it. To answer this query, we first retrieve a superset of the qualifying data regions: we compute the MBR of the query region, and then we recursively descend the R-tree, excluding the branches whose MBRs do not intersect the query MBR. Thus, the R-tree will give us quickly the data regions whose MBR intersects the MBR of the query region. The retrieved data regions will be further examined for intersection with the query region. Algorithms for additional operations (nearest neighbor queries, spatial joins, insertions, and deletions) are more complicated and are still under research (see the Bibliographic Discussion). The original R-tree paper inspired much follow-up work, as described in 348        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING -------1 T ii Figure 12.1 Data (dark rectangles) organized in an R-tree with fanout = 3.

It is important to highlight, however, that any spatial access method can be used (like i?*-trees, X-trees, SR-trees, and so on).
mir-0235	12.3    A Generic Multimedia Indexing Approach To illustrate the basic idea, we shall focus on 'whole match' queries.  For such queries the problem is defined as follows: ï  We have a collection of A" objects: Oi, O2, ..., O4\-. ï  The distance/dissimilarity between two objects (Oi^Oj) is given by the function T)(Ot,O3), which can be implemented as a (possibly, slow) pro-grain. ï   The user specifies a query object Q* and a tolerance e. A GENERIC MULTIMEDIA INDEXING APPROACH        349 Our goal is to find the objects in the collection that are within distance e from the query object. An obvious solution is to apply sequential scanning: For each and every object Oi (1 lt; i lt; JV), we can compute its distance from Q and report the objects with distance Tgt;(Q, Oi) lt; e. However, sequential scanning may be slow, for two reasons: (1)  The distance computation might be expensive. For example, as discussed in Chapter 8, the editing distance in DNA strings requires a dynamic programming algorithm, which grows like the product of the string lengths (typically, in the hundreds or thousands, for DNA databases). (2)  The database size N might be huge. Thus, we are looking for a faster alternative. The GEMINI (GEneric Multimedia object INdexIng) approach we present next, is based on two ideas, each of which tries to avoid each of the two disadvantages of sequential scanning: Æ a 'quick-and-dirty'  test,  to discard quickly the vast majority of nonqualifying objects (possibly, allowing some false alarms); Æ the use of spatial access methods, to achieve faster-than-sequential searching. The case is best illustrated with an example. Consider a database of time series, such as yearly stock price movements, with one price per day. Assume that the distance function between two such series S and Q is the Euclidean distance V(S,Q) = where S[i] stands for the value of stock S on the z-th day. Clearly, computing the distance of two stocks will take 365 subtractions and 365 squarings in our example. The idea behind the quick-and-dirty test is to characterize a sequence with a single number, which will help us discard many non-qualifying sequences. Such a number could be, e.g., the average stock price over the year. Clearly, if two stocks differ in their averages by a large margin, it is impossible that they will be similar. The converse is not true, which is exactly the reason we may have false alarms. Numbers that contain some information about a sequence (or a multimedia object, in general), will be referred to as 'features for the rest of this chapter. Using a good feature (like the 'average,' in the stock prices example), we can have a quick test, which will discard many stocks, with a single numerical comparison for each sequence (a big gain over the 365 subtractions and squarings that the original distance function requires). If using one feature is good, using two or more features might be even better, because they may reduce the number of false alarms (at the cost of 350        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING making the quick-and-ciirty test a bit more elaborate and expensive). In our stock prices example, additional features might be, e.g., the standard deviation, or, even better, some of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients, as we shall see in section 12.4. The end result of using / features for each of our objects is that we can map each object into a point in /-dimensional space. We shall refer to this mapping as T() (for T'eature): Definition     Let JF() be the mapping of objects to f-dimensional points, that is, T(O) will be the f-D point that corresponds to object O. This mapping provides the key to improve on the second drawback of sequential scanning: by organizing these f-D points into a spatial access method, we can cluster them in a hierarchical structure, like the R*-trees. Upon a query, we can exploit the i?*-tree, to prune out large portions of the database that are not promising. Thus, we do not even have to do the quick-and-dirty test on all of the f-D points! Figure 12.3 illustrates the basic idea: Objects (e.g., time series that are 365 points long) are mapped into 2D points (e.g., using the average and the standard deviation as features). Consider the 'whole match' query that requires all the objects that are similar to Sn within tolerance e: this query becomes an f-D sphere in feature space, centered on the image J-(Sn) of Sn. Such queries on multidimensional points is exactly what R-trees and other SAMs are designed to answer efficiently. More specifically, the search algorithm for a wThole match query is as follows: Feature2 /'   \ / 365 I   ,                                                                         .'                          Feature 1 I                                    365 Figure 12.3    Illustration of the basic idea: a database of sequences S\.....S.v; each sequence is mapped to a point in feature space; a query with tolerance s becomes a sphere of radius 5. A GENERIC MULTIMEDIA INDEXING APPROACH        351 Algorithm 1 Search: (1)  Map the query object Q into a point F(Q) in feature space. (2)  Using a spatial access method, retrieve all points within the desired tolerance e fromF(Q). (3)  Retrieve the corresponding objects, compute their actual distance from Q and discard the false alarms. Intuitively, the method has the potential to relieve both problems of the sequential scan, presumably resulting in much faster searches. The only step that we have to be careful with is that the mapping !F() from objects to /-D points does not distort the distances. Let V{) be the distance function of two objects, and Vfeature() be the (say, Euclidean) distance of the corresponding feature vectors. Ideally, the mapping should preserve the distances exactly, in which case the SAM will have neither false alarms nor false dismissals. However, requiring perfect distance preservation might be difficult. For example, it is not obvious which features we have to use to match the editing distance between two DNA strings. Even if the features are obvious, there might be practical problems: for example, in the stock price example, we could treat every sequence as a 365-dimensional vector; although in theory a SAM can support an arbitrary number of dimensions, in practice they all suffer from the 'dimensionality curse,' as discussed earlier. The crucial observation is that we can guarantee that there will be no false dismissals if the distance in feature space matches or underestimates the distance between two objects. Intuitively, this means that our mapping T() from objects to points should make things look closer (i.e., it should be a contractive mapping). Mathematically, let O\ and O2 be two objects (e.g., same-length sequences) with distance function V() (e.g., the Euclidean distance) and F(O\), F{02) be their feature vectors (e.g., their first few Fourier coefficients), with distance function Vfeaiure() (e.g., the Euclidean distance, again). Then we have: Lemma 12.1 (Lower Bounding) To guarantee no false dismissals for whole-match queries, the feature extraction function P() should satisfy the following formula: VfeatUre{HOi),F(O2)) lt; V{OUO2)                                            (12.3) As proved in [249], lower-bounding the distance works correctly for range queries.   Will it work for the other queries of interest, like "all pairs" and 'nearest neighbor' ones? The answer is affirmative in both cases. An "all pairs* query can easily be handled by a "spatial join" on the points of the feature space: using a similar reasoning as before, we see that the resulting set of pairs will be a superset of the qualifying pairs. For the nearest neighbor query, the following algorithm guarantees no false dismissals: (1) find the point T{P) that is the 352        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING nearest neighbor to the query point !F(Q), (2) issue a range query, with query object Q and radius e = U(Q,P) (i.e., the actual distance between the query object Q and data object P). In conclusion, the GEMINI approach to indexing multimedia objects for fast similarity searching is as follows: Algorithm 2 (GEMINI) GEneric Multimedia object INdexIng approach: (1)  Determine the distance function Tgt;() between two objects. (2)  Find one or more numerical feature-extraction functions,   to provide a 'quick-and-dirty' test. (3)  Prove that the distance in feature space lower-bounds the actual distance Tgt;(), to guarantee correctness. (4)   Use a SAM (e.g., an R-tree), to store and retrieve the f-D feature vectors. The first two steps of GEMINI deserve some more discussion: the first step involves a domain expert. The methodology focuses on the speed of search only; the quality of the results is completely relying on the distance function that the expert will provide. Thus, GEMINI will return exactly the same response set (and therefore, the same quality of output, in terms of precision-recall) that would be returned by a sequential scanning of the database; the only difference is that GEMINI will be faster. The second step of GEMINI requires intuition and imagination. It starts by trying to answer the question (referred to as the 'feature-extracting' question for the rest of this chapter): 'Feature-extracting' question: If we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each data object, what should this feature be? The successful answers to the above question should meet two goals: first, they should facilitate step 3 (the distance lower-bounding), and second, they should capture most of the characteristics of the objects. We give case studies of steps 2 and 3 of the GEMINI algorithm in the following sections. The first involves ID time series, and the second focuses on 2D color images. We shall see that the philosophy of the quick-and-dirty filter, in conjunction with the lower-bounding lemma, can lead to solutions to two problems: ï  the dimensionality curse (time series) ï  the 'cross-talk' of features (color images). For each case study, we first describe the objects and the distance function, then show how to apply the lower-bounding lemma, and finally give experimental results, on real or realistic data. ONE-DIMENSIONAL TIME SERIES        353
mir-0236	12.4    One-dimensional Time Series Here the goal is to search a collection of (equal-length) time series, to find the ones that are similar to a desirable series. For example, Hn a collection of yearly stock price movements, find the ones that are similar to IBM?
mir-0237	12.4.1    Distance Function According to GEMINI (algorithm 2), the first step is to determine the distance measure between two time series. A typical distance function is the Euclidean distance (equation 12.2), which is routinely used in financial and forecasting applications. Additional, more elaborate distance functions, that, for example, include time-warping, are discussed in section 12.8.
mir-0238	12.4.2    Feature Extraction and Lower-bounding Having decided on the Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure, the next step is to find some features that can lower-bound it. We would like a set of features that first, preserve/lower-bound the distance, and second, carry much information about the corresponding time series (so that the false alarms are few). The second requirement suggests that we use 'good' features, that have much discriminatory power. In the stock price example, a 'bad' feature would be, e.g., the first day's value: the reason being that two stocks might have similar first-day values, yet they may differ significantly from then on. Conversely, two otherwise similar sequences may agree everywhere, except for the first day's values. At the other extreme, we could use the values of all 365 days as features. However, although this would perfectly match the actual distance, it would lead to the 'dimensionality curse' problem. Clearly, we need some better features. Applying the second step of the GEMINI algorithm, we ask the feature-extracting question: 'If we are allowed to use only one feature from each sequence, what would this feature be?' A natural answer is the average. By the same token, additional features could be the average of the first half, of the second half, of the first quarter, etc. Or, in a more systematic way, we could use the coefficients of the Fourier transform, and, for our case, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). For a signal x = [xl], i = 0,..., n -~ 1, let Xp denote the n-point DFT coefficient at the F-th frequency ) The third step of the GEMINI methodology is to show that the distance in feature space lower-bounds the actual distance. The solution is provided by ParsevaFs theorem, which states that the DFT preserves the energy of a signal, as well as the distances between two signals: )                                                                     (12.4) 354        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING where X and Y are Fourier transforms of x and y respectively. Thus, if we keep the first /(/ lt; n) coefficients of the DFT as the features, we lower-bound the actual distance: £ \XF - YF\2 F=0 F=0 n-1 i=0 and finally Vfeature^), ?($))    lt;   VV)                                        (12-5) because we ignore positive terms from equation 12.2. Thus, there will be no false dismissals, according to lemma 12.1. Notice that the GEMINI approach can be applied with any orthonormal transform, such as, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the wavelet transform etc., because they all preserve the distance between the original and the transformed space. In fact, our response time will improve with the ability of the transform to concentrate the energy: the fewer the coefficients that contain most of the energy, the more accurate our estimate for the actual distance, the fewer the false alarms, and the faster our response time. Thus, the performance results presented next are just pessimistic bounds; better transforms will achieve even better response times. In addition to being readily available, (e.g., in 'Mathematical bS,' 'maple,1 inatlab' etc.), the DFT concentrates the energy in the first few coefficients, for a large class of signals, the colored noises. These signals have a skewed energy spectrum (O(F~~b), as follows: ï  For 6 = 2, we have the so-called random walks or brown noise, which model successfully stock movements and exchange rates (e.g., [541]). ï  With even more skewed spectrum (b gt; 2), we have the black noises [712]. Such signals model successfully, for example, the water level of rivers and the rainfall patterns as they vary over time [541]. ï  With 6 = 1, we have the pink noise.   BirkhofFs theory [712] claims that interesting' signals, such as musical scores and other works of art, consist of pink noise, whose energy spectrum follows OIF"1). The argument of the theory is that white noise with O(F∞) energy spectrum is completely unpredictable, while brown noise with O(F~2) energy spectrum is too predictable and therefore "boring." The energy spectrum of pink noise lies in between.

As an illustration of the above observations, Figure 12.4(a) plots the movement of the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the US dollar starting 7 August 1990 (3000 measurements); Figure 12.4(b) shows the amplitude of the Fourier coefficients as a function of the frequency F, as well as the 1/F line, in a logarithmic-logarithmic plot. Notice that, since it is successfully modeled as a random walk, the amplitude of the Fourier coefficients follow the 1/F line. The above data set is available through anonymous ftp from sfi.santafe.edu. In addition to ID signals (stock price movements and exchange rates), it is believed that several families of real n-D signals belong to the family of 'colored noises', with skewed spectrum. For example, 2D signals, like photographs, are far from white noise, exhibiting a few strong coefficients in the lower spatial frequencies. The JPEG image compression standard exploits this phenomenon, effectively ignoring the high frequency components of the discrete cosine transform, which is closely related to the Fourier transform. If the image consisted of white noise, no compression would be possible at all.
mir-0239	12.4.3    Experiments Performance results with the GEMINI approach on time series are reported in [6]. There, the method is compared to a sequential scanning method. The R*-tree was used for the spatial access method within GEMINI. The sequences were artificially generated random walks, with length n = 1024; their number A7 varied from 50 to 400. Figure 12.5 shows the break-up of the response time, as a function of the number / of DFT coefficients kept. The diamonds, triangles, and squares indicate total time, post-processing time, and i?*-tree time, respectively. Notice that, as we keep more features /, the i?*~tree becomes bigger and slower, but more accurate (fewer false alarms, and therefore shorter post-processing time). This tradeoff reaches an equilibrium for / = 2 or 3. For the rest of the experiments, the / = 2 Fourier coefficients were kept for indexing, resulting in a four-dimensional i?*-tree (two real numbers for each complex DFT coefficient). 356        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING p; 80 63	lt; gt;-----------------^óó ?

Figure 12.6 shows the response time for the two methods (GEMINI and sequential scan), as a function of the number of sequences N. Clearly, GEMINI outperforms the sequential scanning. The major conclusions from the application of GEMINI on time series are the following: (1J GEMINI can be successfully applied to time series, and specifically to the ones that behave like 'colored noises' (stock prices movements, currency exchange rates, water level in rivers etc.). (2) For signals with skewed spectrum like the above ones, the minimum in the response time is achieved for a small number of Fourier coefficients (/ = 1,2,3).   Moreover, the minimum is rather flat, which implies that TWO-DIMENSIONAL COLOR IMAGES        357 a suboptimal choice for / will give search time that is close to the minimum. Thus, with the help of the lower-bounding lemma and the energy-concentrating properties of the DFT, we managed to avoid the 'dimensionality curse.' (3) The success in ID series suggests that GEMINI is promising for 2D or higher-dimensionality signals, if those signals also have skewed spectrum. The success of JPEG (that uses DOT) indicates that real images indeed have a skewed spectrum. Finally, the method has been extended to handle subpattern matching; for time sequences, the details are in [249]. We only mention the main idea here. Assuming that query patterns have length of at least iu, we preprocess every sequence of the database, by allowing a sliding window of length w at each and every possible position, and by extracting the / features for a given positioning of the window. Thus, every sequence becomes a trail in the /-dimensional feature space, which can be further approximated by a set of few MBRs that cover it. Representing each sequence by a few MBRs in feature space may allow false alarms, but no false dismissals. The approach can be generalized for subpattern matching in 2D signals (and, in general, in n-dimensional vector fields).
mir-0240	12.5    Two-dimensional Color Images GEMINI has also been applied for color images, within the QBIC project of IBM. The QBIC (Query By Image Content) project studies methods to query large online image databases using the images' content as the basis of the queries. Examples of the content include color, texture, shape, position, and dominant edges of image items and regions. Potential applications include medical ("Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photojournalism ('Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom"), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Here we will discuss methods on databases of still images, with two main datatypes: images' (= "scenes') and 'items.' A scene is a (color) image, and an item is a part of a scene, for example, a person, a piece of outlined texture, or an apple. Each scene has zero or more items. The identification and extraction of items is beyond the scope of this discussion (see [603] for more details). In this section we give an overview of the indexing aspects of QBIC, and specifically the distance functions and the application of the GEMINI approach. More details about the algorithms and the implementation of QBIC are in [257].
mir-0241	12.5.1    Image Features and Distance Functions We mainly focus on the color features, because color presents an interesting problem (namely, the % cross-talk" of features), which can be resolved by the GEMINI 358        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING pixel count orange pink dark blue bright red light blue Figure 12.7    An example of a color histogram of a fictitious sunset photograph: many red, pink, orange, purple, and blue-ish pixels; few yellow, white, and green-ish ones. approach (algorithm 2). For color, we compute a /e-element color histogram for each item and scene, where k = 256 or 64 colors. Each component in the color histogram is the percentage of pixels that are most similar to that color. Figure 12.7 gives an example of such a histogram of a fictitious photograph of a sunset: there are many red, pink, orange, and purple pixels, but only a few white and green ones. Once these histograms are computed, one method to measure the distance between two histograms (A: x 1 vectors) x and y is given by xj - y3) (12.6) where the superscript t indicates matrix transposition, and the color-to-color similarity matrix A has entries ai3 which describe the similarity between color i and color j.
mir-0242	12.5.2    Lower-bounding In applying the GEMINI method for color indexing, there are two obstacles: first, the 'dimensionality curse' (k may be large, e.g. 64 or 256 for color features) and, most importantly, the quadratic nature of the distance function.  The distance function in the feature space involves cross-talk among the features (see equation 12.6), and thus it is a full quadratic form involving all cross terms. Not only is such a function much more expensive to compute than a Euclidean (or any Lp) distance, but it also precludes efficient implementation of commonly used spatial access methods. Figure 12.8 illustrates the situation. To compute the distance between the two color histograms x and q, the, e.g., bright-red component off has to be compared not only to the bright-red component of q, but also to the pink, orange, etc. components of q. TWO-DIMENSIONAL COLOR IMAGES        359 bright red pink orange _e.g., 64 colors. Figure 12.8    Illustration of the 'cross-talk' between two color histograms. To resolve the cross-talk problem, we try to apply the GEMINI approach (algorithm 2). The first step of the algorithm has been done: the distance function between two color images is given by equation 12.6, that is, V() = dhistO-The second step is to find one or more numerical features, whose Euclidean distance would lower-bound dhistO- Thus, we ask the feature-extracting question again: // we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each color image, what should this feature be? Taking a cue from the previous section on time series, we can consider some average value, or the first few coefficients of the two-dimensional DFT transform. Since we have three color components, (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue), we could consider the average amount of red, green, and blue in a given color image. Notice that different color spaces (such as Munsell) can be used, with absolutely no change in our indexing algorithms. Thus, we continue the discussion with the RGB color space. This means that the color of an individual pixel is described by the triplet (R,G,B) (for cR'ed, 'G'reen, 4B'lue). The average color vector of an image or item x = {Ravg, GaVgy Bavg)t, is defined in the obvious way, with p=l p p=l p Bavg     = p=l where P is the number of pixels in the item, and R(p), G(p), and B(p) are the red, green and blue components (intensities, typically in the range 0-255) respectively of the p-th pixel. Given the average colors j1 and y of two items, we define davg() as the Euclidean distance between the three-dimensional average 360        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING color vectors, d2avg{x,y) = (x-y)\x~y)                                                    (12.7) The third step of the GEMINI algorithm is to prove that our simplified distance davg() lower-bounds the actual distance dhistQ- Indeed, this is true, as an application of the so-called Quadratic Distance Bounding or QDB Theorem (see [244]). The result is that, given a color query, our retrieval proceeds by first filtering the set of images based on their average (R, G, B) color, then doing a final, more accurate matching using their full /c-element histogram. The resulting speedup is discussed next.
mir-0243	12.5.3    Experiments We now present experimental results [244] with GEMINI on color, using the bounding theorem, The experiments compare the relative performance (in terms of CPU time and disk accesses) between first, simple sequential evaluation of dhist f∞r a^ database vectors (referred to as 'naive'), and second, GEMINI. The experiments report the total and the CPU times required by the methods, by performing simulations on a database of N = 924 color image histograms, each of A; = 256 colors, of assorted natural images. Results are shown in Figure 12.9, which presents the total response time as a function of the selectivity (ratio of actual hits over the database size N). The figure also shows the CPU time for each method. Notice that, even for a selectivity of 5% (which would return ~ 50 images to the user), the GEMINI method is much faster than the straightforward, sequential computation of the histogram distances. In fact, it requires from a fraction of a second up to ´ 4 seconds, while the naive method requires consistently ´ 10 seconds. Moreover, notice that for larger databases, the naive method will have a linearly increasing response time. Thus, the conclusions are the following: ï  The GEMINI approach (i.e., the idea to extract some features for a quick-and-dirty test) motivated a fast method, using the average RGB distance; it also motivated a strong theorem (the so-called QDB theorem [244]) which guarantees the correctness in our case. ï  In addition to resolving the cross-talk problem, GEMINI solved the 'dimensionality curse' problem at no extra cost, requiring only / = 3 features, as opposed to k = 64 or 256 that dhtst{) required.
mir-0244	12.6    Automatic Feature Extraction GEMINI is useful for any setting that we can extract features from.   In fact, algorithms for automatic feature extraction methods exist, like the 'MultidimenTRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        361 2000		Total ti CPUti CPU time for na	ne - GEMINI ------ me-GEMINI ó-  -we sequential ive sequential 0000			8000			6000 4000		___------óó	--------------------------' _------0 Figure 12.9    Response time vs. selectivity, for the sequential ('naive') retrieval and for GEMINI. sional Scaling' (MDS) and 'FastMap.' Extracting features not only facilitates the use of off-the-shelf spatial access methods, but it also allows for visual data mining: we can plot a 2D or 3D projection of the data set, and inspect it for clusters, correlations, and other patterns. Figure 12.10 shows the results of FastMap on 35 documents of seven classes, after deriving k = 3 features/dimensions. The classes include basketball reports ('Bbr'), abstracts of computer science technical reports (cAbs5), cooking recipes ('Rec'), and so on. The distance function was a decreasing function of the cosine similarity. The figure shows the 3D scatter-plot, (a) in its entirety and (b) after zooming into the center, to highlight the clustering abilities of FastMap. Notice that the seven classes are separated well, in only k = 3 dimensions.
mir-0245	12.7    Trends and Research Issues In this chapter wre focused on how to accelerate queries by content on image databases and, more general, on multimedia databases. Target queries are, e.g., "find images with a color distribution of a sunset photography or, 'find companies whose stock price moves similarly to a given company's stock." The method expects a distance function Tgt;() (given by domain experts), which should measure the dissimilarity between two images or objects O\* 02-We mainly examined whole match, range queries (that is, 'queries by example" where the user specifies the ideal object and asks for all objects that are within distance e from the ideal object). Extensions to other types of queries (nearest neighbors, all pairs and subpattern match) are briefly discussed. We focused on the GEMINI approach, which combines two ideas: ï The first Is to devise a kquick-and-dirty" test, which will eliminate several 362 MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING (a) (b) Figure 12.10    A collection of documents, after FastMap in 3-D space: (a) the whole collection and (b) magnification of the dashed box. non-qualifying objects. To achieve that, we should extract / numerical features from each object, which should somehow describe the object (for example, the first few DFT coefficients for a time sequence, or for a grayscale image). The key question to ask is 'If we are allowed to use only one numerical feature to describe each data object, what should this feature be?' ï The second idea is to further accelerate the search, by organizing these f-dimensional points using state-of-the art spatial access methods [400], like the i?*~trees. These methods typically group neighboring points together, thus managing to discard large unpromising portions of the address space early. The above two ideas achieve fast searching. Moreover, we need to consider the condition under which the above method will be not only fast, but also correct in the sense that it will not miss any qualifying object. Notice that false alarms are acceptable, because they can be discarded, in the obvious way. The answer is provided by the lower-bounding lemma, which intuitively states that the mapping J-() of objects to /-D points should make things look closer. In the rest of the chapter, we discussed how to apply GEMINI for a variety of environments, like ID time sequences and 2D color images. As discussed in the bibliographic notes, GEMINI has been applied to multiple other settings, like tumor-like shapes, time sequences with the time-warping distance function, 2D medical images, and so on. Moreover, it is one of the main reasons behind a strong recent interest on high-dimensionality index structures. With respect to future trends, probably the most notable and most challenging trend is data mining in multimedia and mixed-media data sets. For example, given a collection of medical records, with demographic data, text data BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        363 (like history), 2D images (like X-rays), and ID signals (electrocardiograms), we want to find correlations, clusters, patterns, and outliers. Successful detection of such patterns is the basis for forecasting, for hypothesis formation, anomaly detection, and several other knowledge discovery operations. GEMINI, insisting on turning every data type into a feature vector, should prove extremely useful: the reason is that it opens the door for off-the-shelf statistical and machine learning packages, which typically expect a set of vectors as input. Typical such packages are the 'Principal Component Analysis' (PCA, also known as 'Latent Semantic Indexing' (LSI), 'Karhunen-Loeve Transform' (KLT), and 'Singular Value Decomposition' (SVD)), Artificial Neural Networks, tree classifiers, to name a few.
mir-0246	12.8    Bibliographic Discussion Spatial Access Methods Structures and Algorithms For a recent, very thorough survey of spatial access methods, see [290]. For the introduction of R-trees, see the seminal paper by Guttman [330]. Among the numerous follow-up variations, the jR*-tree [69] seems to be one of the best performing methods, using the idea of deferred splitting with 'forced-reinsert,' thus achieving higher space utilization, and therefore more compact, shorter, and faster trees. Another strong contender is the Hilbert R-tree [427], which achieves even higher space utilization and often outperforms the JT-tree. A generalized framework and implementation for all these methods is the GiST tree [362] which is available, at the time of writing, at http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu:8000 /gist. With respect to algorithms, the range search is trivial in R-trees. Nearest neighbors queries require more careful record keeping, with a branch-and-bound algorithm (e.g., [686]). Spatial joins (e.g., 'find all pairs of points within distance £') have also attracted a lot of interest: see the filtering algorithms in [119] and the methods in [521] and [458]. Indexing high-dimensional address spaces has attracted a lot of recent interest: the TV-trees [519] adaptively use only a few of the available dimensions. The SR-trees [431] use spheres in conjunction to rectangles, as bounding regions. The more recent X-trees [83] gracefully switch to sequential scanning for extremely high dimensionalities. For the analysis of spatial access methods and selectivity estimation, the concept of "fractal dimension' has given very accurate results in every case it was tried: range queries [247], nearest neighbor queries [628], spatial joins [79]. quadtrees [245]. The idea behind the fractal dimension is to consider the intrinsic dimensionality of the given set of points. For example, consider the points on the diagonal of a 3D cube: their "embedding' dimensionality is E = 3: however, their intrinsic dimensionality is D = 1. Using the appropriate definition for the dimensionality, like the Hausdorff fractal dimension, or the correlation fractal 364        MULTIMEDIA IR: INDEXING AND SEARCHING dimension [712], it turns out that real data sets have a fractional dimensionality: the value is 1.1-1.2 for coastlines, ~2.7 for the brain surface of mammals, ´1.3 for the periphery of rain patches, ´1.7 for the end-points of road segments, to name but a few [247]. Metric Trees Finally, a class of access methods that operate on the distance function directly seems promising. These methods require only a distance function, and they typically build a cluster hierarchy, that is, a tree structure of 'spheres', which include the children spheres, and so on, recursively. This class includes the Burkhard-Keller methods [131], the Fixed-query trees [47], the GNAT trees [116], the MVP trees [112], and the M-trees [172]. The technology is still young: most of the above methods are designed for static data sets. On the positive side, they don't need feature extraction; on the negative side, they don't provide for visualization and data mining, like GEMINI and FastMap do (see Figure 12.10). Multimedia Indexing, DSP and Feature Extraction GEMINI ó Feature Extraction Probably the earliest paper that suggested feature extraction for fast indexing is [400], for approximate matching in shapes. The proof of the lower bounding lemma is in [249]. Algorithms for automatic feature extraction include the traditional, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), see, e.g., [462]. MDS has attracted tremendous interest, but it is O(iV2), quadratic on the number of database objects N. Thus, it is impractical for large data sets. An O(N) alternative is the so-called FastMap [248], which was used to produce Figure 12.10. Time Sequences For additional, more elaborate distance functions, that include time-warping, see Chapter 8 or [706]. An indexing method with the time-warping distance function has recently been developed [840], using FastMap. For linear time sequence forecasting, see the classic book on the Box-Jenkins methodology [109]. For more recent, non-linear forecasting methods, see the intriguing volumes from the Santa-Fe Institute [149, 808]. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Powerful tools for the analysis of time sequences and n-D signals in general include the traditional Fourier transform (see, e.g., [622]), the popular    discrete cosine transform, which is the basis for the JPEG image compression standard [802], and the more recent, and even more effective, wavelet transform (DWT) [689]. An excellent introduction to all these methods, as well as source code, is available in [051]. BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        365 Image Features and Similarity Functions There is a lot of work in machine vision on feature extraction and similarity measures. Classic references are e.g., [53, 224, 285]. A recent survey on image registration and image comparison methods is in [125]. The proof for quadratic distance bounding theorem of section 12.5 is in [244]. Other Applications of Multimedia Indexing There are numerous papers on indexing in multimedia databases. A small sample of them include the following: for time sequences allowing scaling or subpattern matching, see [305], [7], [246]. For voice and video see, e.g., [800]. For shapes see, e.g., [244]. For medical image databases see, e.g., [381], [454], [635]. For multimedia searching on the Web, see, e.g., [4, 733, 80, 714]. Data Mining Finally, there is a lot of work on traditional machine learning [565] and statistics (e.g., [408]).
mir-0248	13.1    Introduction The World Wide Web dates from the end of the 1980s [85] and no one could have imagined its current impact. The boom in the use of the Web and its exponential growth are now well known. Just the amount of textual data available is estimated to be in the order of one terabyte. In addition, other media, such as images, audio, and video, are also available. Thus, the Web can be seen as a very large, unstructured but ubiquitous database. This triggers the need for efficient tools to manage, retrieve, and filter information from this database. This problem is also becoming important in large intranets, where we want to extract or infer new information to support a decision process, a task called data mining. As mentioned in Chapter 1, we make the important distinction between data and information retrieval. We are interested in the latter case, in which the user searches for data that fulfills his information need. We focus on text, because although there are techniques to search for images and other non-textual data, they cannot be applied (yet) on a large scale. We also emphasize syntactic search. That is, we search for Web documents that have user-specified words or patterns in their text. As discussed in Chapter 2, such words or patterns may or may not reflect the intrinsic semantics of the text. An alternative approach to syntactic search is to do a natural language analysis of the text. Although the techniques to preprocess natural language and extract the text semantics are not new, they are not yet very effective and they are also too costly for large amounts of data. In addition, in most cases they are only effective with well structured text, a thesaurus, and other contextual information. There are basically three different forms of searching the Web, Two of them are well known and are frequently used. The first is to use search engines that index a portion of the Web documents as a full-text database. The second is to use Web directories, which classify selected Web documents by subject. The third and not yet fully available, is to search the Web exploiting its hyperlinkf f We will use hyperlink or link to denote a pointer (anchor) from a Web page to another Web page. 367 368        SEARCHING THE WEB structure. We cover all three forms of Web search here. We first discuss the challenges of searching the Web, followed by some Web statistics and models which can be used to understand the complexity of the problem. Next, we discuss in detail the main tools used today to search the Web. The discussion includes search engines, Web directories, hybrid systems, user interfaces, and searching examples. We continue with new query languages that exploit the graphical structure of the Web. Finally, we survey current trends and research issues. As Web research is a very dynamic field, we may have missed some important work, for which we apologize in advance.
mir-0249	13.2    Challenges We now mention the main problems posed by the Web. We can divide them in two classes: problems with the data itself and problems regarding the user and his interaction with the retrieval system. The problems related to the data are: Æ Distributed data: due to the intrinsic nature of the Web, data spans over many computers and platforms. These computers are interconnected with no predefined topology and the available bandwidth and reliability on the network interconnections varies widely. ï  High percentage of volatile data: due to Internet dynamics, new computers and data can be added or removed easily (it is estimated that 40% of the Web changes every month [424]). We also have dangling links and relocation problems when domain or file names change or disappear. ï  Large volume: the exponential growth of the Web poses scaling issues that are difficult to cope with. ï  Unstructured and redundant data: most people say that the Web is a distributed hypertext.  However, this is not exactly so.  Any hypertext has a conceptual model behind it, which organizes and adds consistency to the data and the hyperlinks. That is hardly true in the Web, even for individual documents. In addition, each HTML page is not well structured and some people use the term semi-structured data. Moreover, much Web data is repeated (mirrored or copied) or very similar. Approximately 30% of Web pages are (near) duplicates [120, 723].  Semantic redundancy can be even larger. ï  Quality of data: the Web can be considered as a new publishing medium. However, there is, in most cases, no editorial process. So, data can be false, invalid (for example, because it is too old), poorly written or, typically, with many errors from different sources (typos, grammatical mistakes, OCR errors, etc.). Preliminary studies show that the number of words with typos can range from 1 in 200 for common words to 1 in 3 for foreign surnames [588;. CHARACTERIZING THE WEB        369 Æ Heterogeneous data: in addition to having to deal with multiple media types and hence with multiple formats, we also have different languages and, what is worse, different alphabets, some of them very large (for example, Chinese or Japanese Kanji). Most of these problems (such as the variety of data types and poor data quality) are not solvable simply by software improvements. In fact, many of them will not change (and they should not, as in the case of language diversity!) because they are problems (also features) intrinsic to human nature. The second class of problems are those faced by the user during the interaction with the retrieval system. There are basically two problems: (1) how to specify a query and (2) how to interpret the answer provided by the system. Without taking into account the semantic content of a document, it is not easy to precisely specify a query, unless it is very simple. Further, even if the user is able to pose the query, the answer might be a thousand Web pages. How do we handle a large answer? How do we rank the documents? How do we select the documents that really are of interest to the user? In addition, a single document could be large. How do we browse efficiently in large documents? So, the overall challenge, in spite of the intrinsic problems posed by the Web, is to submit a good query to the search system, and obtain a manageable and relevant answer. Moreover, in practice we should try to achieve the latter goal even for poorly formulated queries. In the rest of this chapter, we use the term Web pages for HTML documents (HTML is described in Chapter 6). To denote all possible data types available on the Web, we use the term Web documents.
mir-0251	13.3.1    Measuring the Web Measuring the Internet and in particular the Web, is a difficult task due to its highly dynamic nature. Nowadays, there are more than 40 million computers in more than 200 countries connected to the Internet, many of them hosting Web servers. The estimated number of Web servers ranges from 2.4 million according to NetSizer [597] (November 1998) to over three million according to the Netcraft Web survey [596] (October 1998). This wide range might be explained when we consider that there are many Web sites that share the same Web server using virtual hosts, that not all of them are fully accessible, that many of them are provisional, etc. Other estimations were made by sampling 0.1% of all Internet numeric addresses obtaining about 2 million unique Web sites [619] or by counting domain names starting with www which in July 1998 were 780,000 according to the Internet Domain survey [599]. However, since not all Web servers have this prefix, the real number is even higher. Considering that in July 1998 the number of Internet hosts was estimated at 36.7 million [599], there is about one Web server per every ten computers connected to the 370 SEARCHING THE WEB Internet. The characterization of the Web is a new task of the Web Consortium [797]. In two interesting articles, already (sadly) outdated, Bray [114] and Woodruff et al. [834] studied different statistical measures of the Web. The first study uses 11 million pages while the second uses 2.6 million pages, with both sets gathered in November 1995. Their characterization of Web pages is partially reproduced in the following paragraphs. A first question is how many different institutions (not Web servers) maintain Web data. This number is smaller than the number of servers, because many places have multiple servers. The exact number is unknown, but should be more than 40% of the number of Web servers (this percentage was the value back in 1995). The exact number of Web pages is also not known. Estimates at the beginning of 1998 ranged from 200 to 320 million, with 350 million as the best current estimate (July 1998 [91]). The latter study used 20,000 random queries based on a lexicon of 400,000 words extracted from Yahoo!. Those queries were submitted to four search engines and the union of all the answers covered about 70% of the Web. Figure 13.1 gives an approximation of how the number of Web servers and the number of pages have changed in recent years. Between 1997 and 1998, the size of the Web doubled in nine months and is currently growing at a rate of 20 million pages per month. On the other hand, it is estimated that the 30,000 largest Web sites (about 1% of the Web) account for approximately 50% of all Web pages [619]. The most popular formats for Web documents are HTML, followed by GIF and JPG (both for images), ASCII text, and Postscript, in that order. The most popular compression tools used are GNU zip, Zip, and Compress. What is a typical HTML page? First, most HTML pages are not standard, meaning that they do not comply with all the HTML specifications.   In ad300 200 Number of Web pages (millions) _cl 19% 1997 1998 Figure 13.1    Approximate growth of the Web. CHARACTERIZING THE WEB        371 dition, although HTML is an instance of SGML, HTML documents seldom start with a formal document type definition. Second, they are small (around 5 Kbs on average with a median of 2 Kbs) and usually contain few images (between one and two on average with an average size of 14 Kb). The pages that have images use them for presentation issues such as colored bullets and lines. An average page has between five and 15 hyperlinks (more than eight links on average) and most of them are local (that is, they point to pages in their own Web server hierarchy). On average, no external server points to any given page (typically, there are only local links pointing to a given page). This is true even for home pages of Web sites. In fact, in 1995, around 80% of these home pages had fewer than ten external links pointing to each of them. The top ten most referenced sites are Microsoft, Netscape, Yahoo!, and top US universities. In these cases we are talking about sites which are referenced by at least 100,000 places. On the other hand, the site with most links to outside sites is Yahoo!. In some sense, Yahoo! and other directories are the glue of the Web. Without them we would have many isolated portions (which is the case with many personal Web pages). If we assume that the average HTML page has 5 Kb and that there are 300 million Web pages, we have at least 1.5 terabytes of text. This is consistent with other measures obtained from search engines. Note that this volume does not include non-textual documents. Regarding the languages used in Web pages, there have been three studies made. The first study was done by Funredes [637] from 1996 to 1998. It uses the AltaVista search engine and is based on searching different words in different languages. This technique might not be significant statistically, but the results are consistent with the second study wrhich was carried out by Alis Technology [11] and is based on automatic software that can detect the language used. One of the goals of the study was to test such software (done in 8000 Web servers). The last study was done by OCLC in June of 1998 [619] by sampling Internet numeric addresses and using the SILC language identification software. Table 13.1 gives the percentages of Web pages written in each language (with the exception of the OCLC data that counts Web sites), as well as the number of people (millions) who speak the language. The variations for Japanese might be due to an inability to detect pages written in Kanji. Some languages, in particular Spanish and Portuguese, are growing fast and will surpass French in the near future. The total number of languages exceeds 100.
mir-0252	13.3.2    Modeling the Web Can we model the document characteristics of the whole Web? Yes, as has already been discussed partially in Chapter 6. The Heaps' and Zipf's laws are also valid in the Web. In particular, the vocabulary grows faster (larger 3) and the word distribution should be more biased (larger 0). However, there are no experiments on large Web collections to measure these parameters. 372        SEARCHING THE WEB Language	Funredes	Alis Tech.

Crovella, 1998). Right: Right tail distribution for different file types (from Crovella and Bestavros, 1996). All logarithms are in base 10. An additional model is related to the distribution of document sizes. According to this model, the document sizes are self-similar [201], that is, they have a large variance (a similar behavior appears in Web traffic). This can be modeled by two different distributions. The main body of the distribution follows a logarithmic normal distribution, such that the probability of finding a document of size x bytes is given by P(x) 1 -/x)2/2ct2 where the average (/i) and standard deviation (a) are 9.357 and 1.318, respectively [59;. Figure 13.2 (left) shows the size distribution of the experimental data. SEARCH ENGINES        373 The right tail of the distribution is iheavy-tailed.' That is, the majority of documents are small, but there is a non-trivial number of large documents. This is intuitive for image or video files, but it is also true for HTML pages. A good fit is obtained with the Pareto distribution where x is measured in bytes and k and a are parameters of the distribution [59] (see Figure 13.2 (right)). For text files, a is about 1.36, being smaller for images and other binary formats [201, 819]. Taking all Web documents into account, we get a = 1.1 and k = 9.3 Kb [58]. That is, 9.3 Kb is the cut point between both distributions, and 93% of all the files have a size below this value. In fact, for less than 50 Kb, images are the typical files, from 50 to 300 Kb we have an increasing number of audio files, and over that to several megabytes, video files are more frequent. The parameters of these distributions were obtained from a sample of more than 54,000 Web pages requested by several users in a period of two months of 1995. Recent data collected in 1998 show that the size distributions have the same form, but parameters change [58]. Related information can be found on Web benchmarks such as WebSpec96 and the Sun/Inktomi Inkbench [395].
mir-0253	13.4    Search Engines In this section we cover different architectures of retrieval systems that model the Web as a full-text database. One main difference between standard IR systems and the Wreb is that, in the Web, all queries must be answered without accessing the text (that is, only the indices are available). Otherwise, that would require either storing locally a copy of the Web pages (too expensive) or accessing remote pages through the network at query time (too slow). This difference has an impact on the indexing and searching algorithms, as well as on the query languages made available.
mir-0254	13.4.1    Centralized Architecture Most search engines use a centralized crawler-indexer architecture. Crawlers are programs (software agents) that traverse the Web sending new or updated pages to a main server where they are indexed. Crawlers are also called robots, spiders, wanderers, walkers, and knowbots.   In spite of their name, a crawler does not actually move to and run on remote machines, rather the crawler runs on a local system and sends requests to remote Web servers. The index is used in a centralized fashion to answer queries submitted from different places in the Web. Figure 13.3 shows the software architecture of a search engine based on the AltaVista architecture [17]. It has two parts: one that deals with the users, 374        SEARCHING THE WEB Query Engine   Interface  Users Crawler Indexer Web Figure 13.3    Typical crawler-indexer architecture. consisting of the user interface and the query engine and another that consists of the crawler and indexer modules. In 1998, the overall AltaVista system was running on 20 multi-processor machines, all of them having more than 130 Gb of RAM and over 500 Gb of disk space. Only the query engine uses more than 75% of these resources. The main problem faced by this architecture is the gathering of the data, because of the highly dynamic nature of the Web, the saturated communication links, and the high load at Web servers. Another important problem is the volume of the data. In fact, the crawler-indexer architecture may not be able to cope with Web growth in the near future. Particularly important is good load balancing between the different activities of a search engine, internally (answering queries and indexing) and externally (crawling). The largest search engines, considering Web coverage in June 1998, were AltaVista [17], HotBot [380], Northern Light [608], and Excite [240], in that order. According to recent studies, these engines cover 28-55% [749] or 14-34% [490] of all Web pages, whose number was estimated at over 300 million in 1998. Table 13.2 lists the most important search engines and their estimated sizes along with their corresponding URLs. Beware that some search engines are powered by the same internal engine. For example, HotBot, GoTo, and Microsoft are powered by Inktomi [395] and Magellan by Exciters internal engine. Up to date information can be found in [749, 609]. Most search engines are based in the United States and focus on documents in English. Nevertheless, there are search engines specialized in different countries and/or languages, which are able, for instance, to query and retrieve documents written in Kanji (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). Also there are search engines that take other approaches, like Ask Jeeves! which simulates an interview [34] or DirectHit [215] which ranks the Web pages in the answer in order of their popularity. We should also mention those search engines aimed at specific topics, for example the Search Broker [537] which allows us to search in many specific topics and DejaNews [212] which searches the USENET archives.

There are also engines to retrieve specific Web pages such as personal or institutional home pages or specific objects such as electronic mail addresses, images, or software applets.
mir-0255	13.4.2    Distributed Architecture There are several variants of the crawler-indexer architecture. Among them, the most important is Harvest [108]. Harvest uses a distributed architecture to gather and distribute data, which is more efficient than the crawler architecture. The main drawback is that Harvest requires the coordination of several Web servers. The Harvest distributed approach addresses several of the problems of the crawler-indexer architecture, such as: (1) Web servers receive requests from different crawlers, increasing their load; (2) Web traffic increases because crawlers retrieve entire objects, but most of their content is discarded; and (3) information is gathered independently by each crawler, without coordination between all the search engines. To solve these problems, Harvest introduces two main elements: gatherers and brokers. A gatherer collects and extracts indexing information from one or more Web servers. Gathering times are defined by the system and are periodic (i.e. there are harvesting times as the name of the system suggests). A broker provides the indexing mechanism and the query interface to the data gathered. Brokers retrieve information from one or more gatherers or other brokers, updating incrementally their indices. Depending on the configuration of gatherers and brokers, different improvements on server load and network traffic can be 376 SEARCHING THE WEB Figure 13.4    Harvest architecture. achieved. For example, a gatherer can run on a Web server, generating no external traffic for that server. Also, a gatherer can send information to several brokers, avoiding work repetition. Brokers can also filter information and send it to other brokers. This design allows the sharing of work and information in a very flexible and generic manner. An example of the Harvest architecture is shown in Figure 13.4 [108]. One of the goals of Harvest is to build topic-specific brokers, focusing the index contents and avoiding many of the vocabulary and scaling problems of generic indices. Harvest includes a distinguished broker that allows other brokers to register information about gatherers and brokers. This is useful to search for an appropriate broker or gatherer when building a new system. The Harvest architecture also provides replicators and object caches. A replicator can be used to replicate servers, enhancing user-base scalability. For example, the registration broker can be replicated in different geographic regions to allow faster access. Replication can also be used to divide the gathering process between many Web servers. Finally, the object cache reduces network and server load, as well as response latency when accessing Web pages. More details on the system can be found in [108]. Currently, there are hundreds of Harvest applications on the Web (for example, the CIA, NASA, the US National Academy of Sciences, and the US Government Printing Office), as this software is on the public domain.!

mir-0256	13.4.3    User Interfaces There are two important aspects of the user interface of search engines: the query interface and the answer interface (see also Chapter 10), The basic query interface is a box where one or more words can be typed. Although a user would expect that a given sequence of words represents the same query in all search engines, it does not. For example, in AltaVista a sequence of words is a reference to the union of all the Web pages having at least one of those words, while in HotBot it is a reference to the Web pages having all the words. Another problem is that the logical view of the text is not known, that is, some search engines use stopwords, some do stemming, and some are not case sensitive (see Chapter 7). All search engines also provide a query interface for complex queries as well as a command language including Boolean operators and other features, such as phrase search, proximity search, and wild cards. Figures 13.5 and 13.6 show the query interfaces for complex queries for the three largest search engines. They provide several filtering functions. The results can be filtered by additional words that must be present or absent from the answer or in a particular field such as the URL or title, language, geographic region or Internet domain, date range, or inclusion of specific data types such as images or audio. The answer usually consists of a list of the ten top ranked Web pages. Figure 13.7 shows the three top documents for the main four search engines for the query searching and Web and engine. Each entry in this list includes some information about the document it represents. Typically, the information includes the URL, size, the date when the page was indexed, and a couple of lines with its content (title plus first lines or selected headings or sentences). Some search engines allow the user to change the number of pages returned in the list and the amount of information per page, but in most cases this is fixed or limited to a few choices. The order of the list is typically by relevance, but sorting by URL or date is also available in some engines. In addition, most search engines also have an option to find documents similar to each Web page in the answer. 378        SEARCHING THE WEB k ttte $1 rated search engine Return to fewer Options LwkFor Sweh for pages                      L                                , mustcontsin   **|    tlie words nsptt not contain -ªI   tfaewds limit roisito to After ** i   erim S^7t^ Jtem  -ª´*     Jlt;´ª   JSMme Returner v pmmkfm JSSSSflfiSLJ Words an/where.

The Web pages retrieved by the search engine in response to a user query are ranked, usually using statistics related to the terms in the query. In some cases this may not have any meaning, because relevance is not fully correlated with statistics about term occurrence within the collection. Some search engines also taking into account terms included in metatags or the title, or the popularity of a Web page to improve the ranking. This topic is covered next.
mir-0257	13.4.4    Ranking Most search engines use variations of the Boolean or vector model (see Chapter 2) to do ranking. As with searching, ranking has to be performed without accessing the text, just the index. There is not much public information about the specific ranking algorithms used by current search engines. Further, it is difficult to compare fairly different search engines given their differences, and continuous improvements. More important, it is almost impossible to measure recall, as the number of relevant pages can be quite large for simple queries. Some inconclusive studies include [327, 498]. Yuwono and Lee [844] propose three ranking algorithms in addition to the classical tf~idf scheme (see Chapter 2). They are called Boolean spread, vector spread, and most-cited. The first two are the normal ranking algorithms of the Boolean and vector model extended to include pages pointed to by a page in the answer or pages that point to a page in the answer. The third, most-cited, is based only on the terms included in pages having a link to the pages in the answer. A comparison of these techniques considering 56 queries over a collection of 2400 Web pages indicates that the vector model yields a better recall-precision curve, with an average precision of 75%. Some of the newr ranking algorithms also use hyperlink information. This is an important difference between the Web and normal IR databases. The number of hyperlinks that point to a page provides a measure of its popularity and quality. Also, many links in common between pages or pages referenced by the same page often indicates a relationship between those pages. We now present three examples of ranking techniques that exploit these facts, but they differ in that two of them depend on the query and the last does not. The first is WebQuery [148], which also allows visual browsing of Web pages. WebQuery takes a set of Web pages (for example, the answer to a query) and ranks them based on how connected each Web page is. Additionally, it extends the set by finding Web pages that are highly connected to the original set. A related approach is presented by Li [512], A better idea is due to Kleinberg [444] and used in HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search). This ranking scheme depends on the query and considers the set of pages 5 that point to or are pointed by pages in the answer. Pages that have many links pointing to them in S are called authorities (that is. they should have relevant content). Pages that have many outgoing links are called hubs (they should point to similar content). A positive two-way feedback exists: SEARCH ENGINES        381 better authority pages come from incoming edges from good hubs and better hub pages come from outgoing edges to good authorities. Let H(p) and A(p) be the hub and authority value of page p. These values are defined such that the following equations are satisfied for all pages p: uES  I pó+u                                        v£S | vógt;p where H(p) and A(p) for all pages are normalized (in the original paper, the sum of the squares of each measure is set to one). These values can be determined through an iterative algorithm, and they converge to the principal eigenvector of the link matrix of S. In the case of the Web, to avoid an explosion of the size of 5, a maximal number of pages pointing to the answer can be defined. This technique does not work with non-existent, repeated, or automatically generated links. One solution is to weight each link based on the surrounding content. A second problem is that the topic of the result can become diffused. For example, a particular query is enlarged by a more general topic that contains the original answer. One solution to this problem is to analyze the content of each page and assign a score to it, as in traditional IR ranking. The link weight and the page score can be included on the previous formula multiplying each term of the summation [154, 93, 153]. Experiments show that the recall and precision on the first ten answers increases significantly [93]. The order of the links can also be used by dividing the links into subgroups and using the HITS algorithm on those subgroups instead of the original Web pages [153]. The last example is PageRank, which is part of the ranking algorithm used by Google [117]. PageRank simulates a user navigating randomly in the Web who jumps to a random page with probability q or follows a random hyperlink (on the current page) with probability 1 ó q. It is further assumed that this user never goes back to a previously visited page following an already traversed hyperlink backwards. This process can be modeled with a Markov chain, from where the stationary probability of being in each page can be computed. This value is then used as part of the ranking mechanism of Google. Let C(a) be the number of outgoing links of page a and suppose that page a is pointed to by pages p\ to pn. Then, the PageRank, PR(a) of a is defined as PR{a) = q + (l-q)J2 PR(Pi)/C(pi) where q must be set by the system (a typical value is 0.15). Notice that the ranking (weight) of other pages is normalized by the number of links in the page. PageRank can be computed using an iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the Web (which is the transition matrix of the Markov chain). Crawling the Web using this ordering has been shown to be better than other crawling schemes [168] (see next section). 382        SEARCHING THE WEB Therefore, to help ranking algorithms, page designers should include informative titles, headings, and meta fields, as well as good links. However, keywords should not be repeated as some search engines penalize repeating words (spam-ming). Using full terms instead of indirect ways to refer to subjects should also be considered.
mir-0258	13.4.5    Crawling the Web In this section we discuss how to crawl the Web, as there are several techniques. The simplest is to start with a set of URLs and from there extract other URLs which are followed recursively in a breadth-first or depth-first fashion. For that reason, search engines allow users to submit top Web sites that will be added to the URL set. A variation is to start with a set of populars URLs, because we can expect that they have information frequently requested. Both cases work well for one crawler, but it is difficult to coordinate several crawlers to avoid visiting the same page more than once. Another technique is to partition the Web using country codes or Internet names, and assign one or more robots to each partition, and explore each partition exhaustively. Considering how the Web is traversed, the index of a search engine can be thought of as analogous to the stars in an sky. What we see has never existed, as the light has traveled different distances to reach our eye. Similarly, Web pages referenced in an index were also explored at different dates and they may not exist any more. Nevertheless, when we retrieve a page, we obtain its actual content. How fresh are the Web pages referenced in an index? The pages will be from one day to two months old. For that reason, most search engines show in the answer the date when the page was indexed. The percentage of invalid links stored in search engines vary from 2 to 9%. User submitted pages are usually crawled after a few days or weeks. Starting there, some engines traverse the whole Web site, while others select just a sample of pages or pages up to a certain depth. Non-submitted pages will wait from weeks up to a couple of months to be detected. There are some engines that learn the change frequency of a page and visit it accordingly [175]. They may also crawl more frequently popular pages (for example, pages having many links pointing to them). Overall, the current fastest crawlers are able to traverse up to 10 million Web pages per day. The order in which the URLs are traversed is important. As already mentioned, the links in a Web page can be traversed breadth first or depth first. Using a breadth first policy, we first look at all the pages linked by the current page, and so on. This matches well Web sites that are structured by related topics. On the other hand, the coverage will be wide but shallow and a Web server can be bombarded with many rapid requests. In the depth first case, we follow the first link of a page and we do the same on that page until we cannot go deeper, returning recursively. This provides a narrow but deep traversal Only recently, some research on this problem has appeared [168], showing that good ordering schemes can make a difference if crawling better pages first (using the PageRank scheme mentioned above). SEARCH ENGINES        383 Due to the fact that robots can overwhelm a server with rapid requests and can use significant Internet bandwidth (in particular the whole bandwidth of small domains can be saturated), a set of guidelines for robot behavior has been developed [457]. For this purpose, a special file is placed at the root of every Web server indicating the restrictions at that site, in particular the pages that should not be indexed. Crawlers can also have problems with HTML pages that use frames (a mechanism to divide a page in two or more parts) or image maps (hyperlinks associated to images). In addition, dynamically generated pages cannot be indexed as well as password protected pages.
mir-0259	13.4.6    Indices Most indices use variants of the inverted file (see Chapter 8). In short, an inverted file is a list of sorted words (vocabulary), each one having a set of pointers to the pages where it occurs. Some search engines use elimination of stopwords to reduce the size of the index. Also, it is important to remember that a logical view of the text is indexed. Normalization operations may include removal of punctuation and multiple spaces to just one space between each word, uppercase to lowercase letters, etc. (see Chapter 7). To give the user some idea about each document retrieved, the index is complemented with a short description of each Web page (creation date, size, the title and the first lines or a few headings are typical). Assuming that 500 bytes are required to store the URL and the description of each Web page, we need 50 Gb to store the description for 100 million pages. As the user initially receives only a subset of the complete answer to each query, the search engine usually keeps the whole answer set in memory, to avoid having to recompute it if the user asks for more documents. State of the art indexing techniques can reduce the size of an inverted file to about 30% of the size of the text (less if stopwords are used). For 100 million pages, this implies about 150 Gb of disk space. By using compression techniques, the index size can be reduced to 10% of the text [825]. A query is answered by doing a binary search on the sorted list of words of the inverted file. If we are searching multiple words, the results have to be combined to generate the final answer. This step will be efficient if each word is not too frequent. Another possibility is to compute the complete answer while the user requests more Web pages, using a lazy evaluation scheme. More details on searching over an inverted file can be found in Chapter 8. Inverted files can also point to the actual occurrences of a word within a document (full inversion). However, that is too costly in space for the Web, because each pointer has to specify a page and a position inside the page (word numbers can be used instead of actual bytes). On the other hand, having the positions of the words in a page, we can answer phrase searches or proximity queries by finding words that are near each other in a page. Currently, some search engines are providing phrase searches, but the actual implementation is not known. Finding words which start with a given prefix requires two binary searches in the sorted list of words.    More complex searches, like words with errors, 384        SEARCHING THE WEB arbitrary wild cards or, in general, any regular expression on a word, can be performed by doing a sequential scan over the vocabulary (see Chapter 8). This may seem slow, but the best sequential algorithms for this type of query can search around 20 Mb of text stored in RAM in one second (5 Mb is more or less the vocabulary size for 1 Gb of text). Thus, for several gigabytes we can answer those queries in a few seconds. For the Web this is still too slow but not completely out of the question. In fact, using Heaps' law and assuming /? = 0.7 for the Web, the vocabulary size for 1 Tb is 630 Mb which implies a searching time of half a minute. Pointing to pages or to word positions is an indication of the granularity of the index. The index can be less dense if we point to logical blocks instead of pages. In this way we reduce the variance of the different document sizes, by making all blocks roughly the same size. This not only reduces the size of the pointers (because there are fewer blocks than documents) but also reduces the number of pointers because words have locality of reference (that is, all the occurrences of a non-frequent word will tend to be clustered in the same block). This idea was used in Glimpse [540] which is at the core of Harvest [108]. Queries are resolved as for inverted files, obtaining a list of blocks that are then searched sequentially (exact sequential search can be done over 30 Mb per second in RAM). Glimpse originally used only 256 blocks, which was efficient up to 200 Mb for searching words that were not too frequent, obtaining an index of only 2% of the text. By tuning the number of blocks and the block size, reasonable space-time trade-offs can be achieved for larger document collections (for more details see Chapter 8). These ideas cannot be used (yet) for the Web because sequential search cannot be afforded, as it implies a network access. However, in a distributed architecture where the index is also distributed, logical blocks make sense.
mir-0260	13.5    Browsing In this section we cover Web tools which are based on browsing and searching, in particular Web directories. Although the Web coverage provided by directories is very low (less than 1% of all Web pages), the answers returned to the user are usually much more relevant.
mir-0261	13.5.1    Web Directories The best and oldest example of a Web directory is Yahoo! [839], which is likely the most used searching tool.   Other large Web directories include eBLAST, LookSmart, Magellan, and NewHoo. Some of them are hybrids, because they also provide searches in the whole Web. Most search engines also provide subject categories nowadays, including AltaVista Categories, AOL Netfind, Excite Channels, HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos Subjects, and WebCrawler Select, are specific to some areas. For example, there are Web sites focused on business, news, BROWSING 385 Web directory	URL	Web sites	Categories eBLAST	www.eblast.com	125	_ LookSmart	www.looksmart.com	300	24 Lycos Subjects	a2z.lycos.com	50	Magellan	www.mckinley.com	60 NewHoo	www. lie who o. com	100	23 Netscape	www.netscape.com	-	Search.com	www.search.com	-	Snap	www.snap.com	-	Yahoo!	www.yahoo.com	750 Table 13.3    URLs, Web pages indexed and categories (both in thousands) of some Web directories (beginning of 1998).

Web directories are also called catalogs, yellow pages, or subject directories. Table 13.3 gives the URLs of the most important Web directories (not including the search engines already listed in section 13.4). Directories are hierarchical taxonomies that classify human knowledge. Table 13.4 shows the first level of the taxonomies used by Web directories (the number of first level categories ranges from 12 to 26). Some subcategories are also available in the main page of Web directories, adding around 70 more topics. The largest directory, Yahoo!, has close to one million pages classified, followed by LookSmart, which has about 24,000 categories in total.  Yahoo!  also offers 386        SEARCHING THE WEB 14 regional or country specialized directories in other languages including Chinese, Danish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish. In most cases, pages have to be submitted to the Web directory, where they are reviewed, and, if accepted, classified in one or more categories of the hierarchy. Although the taxonomy can be seen as a tree, there are cross references, so it is really a directed acyclic graph. The main advantage of this technique is that if we find what we are looking-for, the answer will be useful in most cases. On the other hand, the main disadvantage is that the classification is not specialized enough and that not all Web pages are classified. The last problem becomes worse every day as the Web grows. The efforts to do automatic classification, by using clustering or other techniques, are very old. However, up to now, natural language processing is not 100% effective in extracting relevant terms from a document. Thus, classification is done manually by a limited number of people. This is a potential problem with users having a different notion of categories than the manmade categorization. Web directories also allow the user to perform a search on the taxonomy descriptors or in the W7eb pages pointed to by the taxonomy. In fact, as the number of classified Wreb pages is small, we can even afford to have a copy of all pages. In that case they must be updated frequently, which may pose performance and temporal validity problems. In addition, most Web directories also send the query to a search engine (through a strategic alliance) and allow the whole Wreb to be searched.
mir-0262	13.5.2    Combining Searching with Browsing Usually, users either browse following hypertext links or they search a Web site (or the whole Web). Currently, in Web directories, a search can be reduced to a subtree of the taxonomy. However, the search may miss related pages that are not in that part of the taxonomy. Some search engines find similar pages using common words, but often this is not effective. WebGlimpse is a tool that tries to solve these problems by combining browsing with searching [539]. WebGlimpse attaches a small search box to the bottom of every HTML page, and allows the search to cover the neighborhood of that page or the whole site, without having to stop browsing. This is equivalent to following hypertext links that are constructed on the fly through a neighborhood search. WebGlimpse can be useful in building indices for personal Web pages or collections of favorite URLs. First, WebGlimpse indexes a Web site (or a collection of specific documents) and computes neighborhoods according to user specifications. As a result. WebGlimpse adds the search boxes to selected pages, collects remote pages that are relevant, and caches those pages locally. Later, the users can search in the neighborhood of a page using the search boxes. As the name suggests, WebGlimpse uses Glimpse as its search engine [540], The neighborhood of a Web page is defined as the set of Web pages that are reachable by a path of hypertext links within a maximum predefined distance. This distance can be set differently for local and remote pages. For example, it METASEARCHERS        387 can be unlimited locally, but be only three at any remote site. The neighborhood can also include all the subdirectories of the directory where the Web page is. The result is a graph of all the neighborhoods of the Web site or collection, and for each Web page, a file with all the Web pages in its neighborhood. When searching, any query in the whole index can be intersected with a neighborhood list, obtaining the relevant Web pages. A nice addition to WebGlimpse would be to visualize the neighborhoods. This problem is the topic of the next section.
mir-0263	13.5.3    Helpful Tools There are many software tools to help browsing and searching. Some of them are add-ons to browsers, such as Alexa [10]. Alexa is a free Web navigation service that can be attached as a toolbar at the bottom of any browser and accompanies the user in his surfing. It provides useful information about the sites that are visited, including their popularity, speed of access, freshness, and overall quality (obtained from votes of Alexa users). Alexa also suggests related sites helping one's navigation.   Another navigation service and searching guide is WebTaxi [805]. There are other tools that use visual metaphors, which can be broadly classified into two types: tools designed to visualize a subset of the Web and tools designed to visualize large answers. Both cases need to represent a large graph in a meaningful way. Specific commercial examples of tools to visualize Web subsets are Microsoft's SiteAnalyst (formerly from NetCarta), 3MAPA from Dynamic Diagrams, IBM's Mapuccino (formerly WebCutter [527], shown in Figure 10.22), SurfSerf, Merzscope from Merzcom, CLEARweb, Astra SiteManager, WebAn-alyzer from InContext, HistoryTree from SmartBrowser, etc. Non-commercial works include WebMap [220], Sitemap, Ptolomeaus, and many earlier research [234, 578, 564, 20]. We have not included more generic visualization software, where Web visualization is just a particular case, or other related visualization tools such as Web usage analysis [642, 294, 737]. Metaphors to visualize large answers are covered in Chapter 10. Visual tools are not yet deployed in the whole Web because there is no standard way of communicating visualizers and search engines. One possible approach is to use a markup language based on XML (see Chapter 6), as proposed in [15].
mir-0264	13.6    Metasearchers Metasearchers are Web servers that send a given query to several search engines, Web directories and other databases, collect the answers and unify them. Examples are Metacrawler [715] and SawySearch [383, 223]. The main advantages of metasearchers are the ability to combine the results of many sources and the fact that the user can pose the same query to various sources through a single common interface. Metasearchers differ from each other in how ranking 388        SEARCHING THE WEB Metasearcher	URL	Sources used Cyber 411	www.cyber411.com	14 Dogpile	www.dogpile.com	25 Highway 61	www. higliway61. com	5 Inference Find	www.infind.com	6 Mamma	www.mamma.coin	7 MetaCrawler	www.metacrawler.com	7 MetaFind	www.met af ind.c om	7 MetaMiner	www.miner.uol.com.br	13 MetaSearch	www.metasearch.com	_ SavvySearch	savvy.cs.colostate.edu:2000	gt;13 Table 13.5    URLs of metasearchers and number of sources that they use (October 1998). is performed in the unified result (in some cases no ranking is done), and how well they translate the user query to the specific query language of each search engine or Web directory (the query language common to all of them could be small). Table 13.5 shows the URLs of the main metasearch engines as well as the number of search engines, Web directories and other databases that they search. Metasearchers can also run on the client, for example, Copernic, EchoSearch, WebFerret, WebCompass, and WebSeeker. There are others that search several sources and show the different answers in separate windows, such as A1140ne, OneSeek, Proteus, and Search Spaniel. The advantages of metasearchers are that the results can be sorted by different attributes such as host, keyword, date, etc; which can be more informative than the output of a single search engine. Therefore browsing the results should be simpler. On the other hand, the result is not necessarily all the Web pages matching the query, as the number of results per search engine retrieved by the metasearcher is limited (it can be changed by the user, but there is an upper limit). Nevertheless, pages returned by more than one search engine should be more relevant. We expect that new metasearchers will do better ranking. A first step in this direction is the NEC Research Institute metasearch engine, Inquirus [488, 489]. The main difference is that Inquirus actually downloads and analyzes each Web page obtained and then displays each page, highlighting the places where the query terms were found. The results are displayed as soon as they are available in a progressive manner, otherwise the waiting time would be too long. This technique also allows non-existent pages or pages that have changed and do not contain the query any more to be discarded, and. more important, provides for better ranking than normal search engines. On the other hand, this inetajsoaivher is not available to the general public. FINDING THE NEEdigital libraryE IN THE HAYSTACK        389 Measure	Average value	Range Number of words	2.35	0 to 393 Number of operators	0.41	0 to 958 Repetitions of each query	3.97	1-1.5 million Queries per user session	2.02	1-173,325 Screens per query	1.39	1-78,496 Table 13.6    Queries on the Web: average values. The use of metasearchers is justified by coverage studies that show that a small percentage of Web pages are in all search engines [91]. In fact, fewer than 1% of the Web pages indexed by AltaVista, HotBot, Excite, and Infoseek are in all of those search engines. This fact is quite surprising and has not been explained (yet). Metasearchers for specific topics can be considered as software agents and are covered in section 13.8.2.
mir-0266	13.7.1    User Problems We have already glanced at some of the problems faced by the user when interacting with the query interfaces currently provided by search engines. First, the user does not exactly understand the meaning of searching using a set of words, as discussed in Chapter 10. Second, the user may get unexpected answers because he is not aware of the logical view of the text adopted by the system. An example is the use of uppercase letters when the search engine is not case sensitive. Hence, a word like 'Bank7 loses part of its semantics if we search for 'bank.' Simple experiments also show that due to typos or variations of a word, even if correctly capitalized, 10-20% of the matches can be lost. Similarly, foreign names or words that are difficult to spell may appear incorrectly which may result in a loss of up to 50% of the relevant answers, as mentioned in section 13.2. Another problem is that most users have trouble with Boolean logic. In natural language, sometimes we use 'and7 and %or' with different meaning depending on the context. For example, when choosing between two things, we use an exclusive "or,' which does not match the Boolean interpretation. Because of this, several studies show that around 80% of the queries do not use any Boolean or other operation. For these reasons many people have trouble using command query languages, and query forms should clearly specify which words must or must not be contained in a document that belongs to the answer. There are a few surveys and analyses of query logs with respect to the usage of search engines [647, 403, 728], The latter reference is based on 285 million user sessions containing 575 million queries.  Table 13.6 gives the main results 390        SEARCHING THE WEB of that study, carried out in September 1998. Some of the strange results might be due to queries done by mechanized search agents. The number of queries submitted per day to AltaVista is over 13 million. Users select a search engine mainly based on ease of use, speed, coverage, relevance of the answer, and habit. The main purposes are research, leisure, business, and education. The main problems found are that novice users do not know how to start and lack the general knowledge that would help in finding better answers. Other problems are that search engines are slow, that the answer is too large, not very relevant, and not always up to date. Also, most people do not care about advertising, which is one of the main sources of funding for search engines. When searching, 25% of the users use a single keyword, and on average their queries have only two or three terms. In addition, about 15% of the users restrict the search to a predefined topic and most of them (nearly 80%) do not modify the query. In addition, most users (about 85%) only look at the first screen with results and 64% of the queries are unique. Also, many words appear in the same sentence, suggesting that proximity search should be used. There are also studies about users1 demographics and software and hardware used.
mir-0267	13.7.2    Some Examples Now we give a couple of search examples. One problem with full-text retrieval is that although many queries can be effective, many others are a total deception. The main reason is that a set of words does not capture all the semantics of a document. There is too much contextual information (that can be explicit or even implicit) lost at indexing time, which is essential for proper understanding. For example, suppose that we want to learn an oriental game such as Shogi or Go. For the first case, searching for Shogi will quickly give us good Web pages where we can find what Shogi is (a variant of chess) and its rules. However, for Go the task is complicated, because unlike Shogi, Go is not a unique word in English (in particular, because uppercase letters are converted to lowercase letters, see Chapter 7). The problem of having more than one meaning for a word is called polysem,y. We can add more terms to the query, such as game and Japanese but still we are out of luck, as the pages found are almost all about Japanese games written in English where the common verb go is used. Another common problem comes from synonyms. If we are searching for a certain word, but a relevant page uses a synonym, we will not find it. The following example (taken from [152]) better explains the polysemy problem, where the ambiguity comes from the same language. Suppose that we want to find the running speed of the jaguar, a big South American cat. A first naive search in AltaVista would be jaguar speed. The results are pages that talk about the Jaguar car, an Atari video game, a US football team, a local network server, etc. The first page about the animal is ranked 183 and is a fable, without information about the speed. In a second try, we add the term cat. The answers are about the Clans Nova Cat and Smoke Jaguar, LMG Enterprises, fine cars, etc.    Only the page ranked FINDING THE NEEdigital libraryE IN THE HAYSTACK        391 25 has some information on jaguars but not the speed. Suppose we try Yahoo!. We look at 'Science:Biology:Zoology:Animals:Cats:Wild_Cats' and 'Science: Biology :Animal_Beliavior.' No information about jaguars there.
mir-0268	13.7.3    Teaching the User Interfaces are slowly improving in assisting the user with the task of acquiring a better grasp of what Web pages are being retrieved. Query forms must specify clearly if one or all the words must be in a page, which words should not be in a page, etc., without using a written Boolean query language. Second, users should try to give as many terms as possible, in particular terms that must be or should not be in the pages. In particular, a user should include all possible synonyms of a word. If the user can restrict the search to a field (for example, the page title) or limit some attribute (date, country), this will certainly reduce the size of the answer. In case of doubt, the user should remember to look at the help information provided by the search engine. If he cannot find where one of the relevant terms is in a page, he can use the Find option of the browser. Even if we are able to pose a good query, the answer can still be quite large. Considering that the visual tools mentioned before are not yet available for the general public, the user must learn from experience. There are many strategies for quickly finding relevant answers. If the user is looking for an institution, he can always try to guess the corresponding URL by using the www prefix followed by a guessed institution acronym or brief name and ending with a top level domain (country code or com, edu, org, gov for the US). If this does not work, the user can search the institution name in a Web directory. If we are looking for work related to a specific topic, a possible strategy is: (1) select an article relevant to the topic, if possible with non-common author surnames or title keywords (if it is not available, try any bibliographic database or a Web directory search for a first reference); and (2) use a search engine to find all Web pages that have all those surnames and keywords. Many of the results are likely to be relevant, because we can find: (a) newer papers that reference the initial reference, (b) personal Web pages of the authors, and most important, (c) pages about the topic that already contain many relevant references. This strategy can be iterated by changing the reference used as better references appear during the search. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the Web poses so many problems, that it is easier and more effective to teach the user how to properly profit from search engines and Web directories, rather than trying to guess what the user really wants. Given that the coverage of the search engines is low, use several engines or a metasearcher. Also, remember that you have to evaluate the quality of each answer, even if it appears to be relevant. Remember that anybody can publish in the Web, and that does not mean that the data is correct or still valid. The lessons learned in the examples shown above are: (1) search engines still return too much hay together with the needle: and (2) Web directories do not have enough depth to find the needle. So, we can use the following rules of thumb: 392        SEARCHING THE WEB Æ Specific queries Look in an encyclopedia, that is the reason that they exist. In other words, do not forget libraries. Æ Broad queries Use Web directories to find good starting points. ï Vague queries Use Web search engines and improve the query formulation based on relevant answers.
mir-0269	13.8    Searching using Hyperlinks In this section we cover other paradigms to search the Web, which are based on exploiting its hyperlinks. They include Web query languages and dynamic searching. These ideas are still not widely used due to several reasons, including performance limitations and lack of commercial products.
mir-0270	13.8.1    Web Query Languages Up to this point, queries have been based on the content of each page. However, queries can also include the link structure connecting Web pages. For example, we would like to search for all the Web pages that contain at least one image and are reachable from a given site following at most three links. To be able to pose this type of query, different data models have been used. The most important are a labeled graph model to represent Web pages (nodes) and hyperlinks (edges) between Web pages, and a semi-structured data model to represent the content of Wreb pages. In the latter model, the data schema is not usually known, may change over time, may be large and descriptive, etc. [2, 129]. Although some models and languages for querying hypertext were proposed before the Web appeared [563, 72, 184], the first generation of Web query languages were aimed at combining content with structure (see also Chapter 4). These languages combine patterns that appear within the documents with graph queries describing link structure (using path regular expressions). They include W3QL [450], WebSQL [556, 33], WebLog [476], and WQL [511]. The second generation of languages, called Web data manipulation languages, maintain the emphasis on semi-structured data. However, they extend the previous languages by providing access to the structure of Web pages (the model also includes the internal structure) and by allowing the creation of new structures as a result of a query. Languages in this category include STRUQL [253], FLORID [373], and WebOQL [32]. All the languages mentioned are meant to be used by programs, not final users. Nevertheless, there are some examples of query interfaces for these languages. Web query languages have been extended to other Web tasks, such as extracting and integrating information from Web pages, and constructing and restructuring Web sites. More details about Web query languages can be found in the excellent survey by Florescu, Levy, and Mendelzon [258]. TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        393
mir-0271	13.8.2    Dynamic Search and Software Agents Dynamic search in the Web is equivalent to sequential text searching. The idea is to use an online search to discover relevant information by following links. The main advantage is that you are searching in the current structure of the Web, and not in what is stored in the index of a search engine. While this approach is slow for the entire Web, it might be used in small and dynamic subsets of the Web. The first heuristic devised was the fish search [113], which exploits the intuition that relevant documents often have neighbors that are relevant. Hence, the search is guided by following links in relevant documents. This was improved by shark search [366], which does a better relevance assessment of neighboring pages. This algorithm has been embedded in Mapuccino (see section 13.5.3), and Figure 10.22 shows a Web subset generated by this type of search. The main idea of these algorithms is to follow links in some priority, starting from a single page and a given query. At each step, the page with highest priority is analyzed. If it is found to be relevant, a heuristic decides to follow or not to follow the links on that page. If so, new pages are added to the priority list in the appropriate positions. Related work includes software agents for searching specific information on the Web [602, 477]. This implies dealing with heterogeneous sources of information which have to be combined. Important issues in this case are how to determine relevant sources (see also Chapters 9 and 15, as well as section 10.4.4) and and how to merge the results retrieved (the fusion problem). Examples are shopping robots such as Jango [401], Junglee [180], and Express [241].
mir-0272	13.9    Trends and Research Issues The future of the Web might surprise us, considering that its massive use started less than five years ago. There are many distinct trends and each one opens up new and particular research problems. What follows is a compilation of the major trends as we have perceived them. ï  Modeling: Special IR models tailored for the Web are needed [308, 155, 652].  As we have seen, Web user queries are different.  We also have the pull/push dichotomy: Will we search for information or will the information reach us? In both cases we need better search paradigms and better information filtering [782]. ï  Querying: Further work on combining structure and content in the queries is needed as well as new visual metaphors to pose those queries and visualize the answers [44]. Future query languages may include concept-based search and natural language processing, as well as searching by example (this implies document clustering and categorization on the Web [810,120, 157]). ï  Distributed architectures:   New distributed schemes to traverse and search the Web must be devised to cope with its growth.  This will have an impact on current crawling and indexing techniques, as well as caching 394        SEARCHING THE WEB techniques for the Web. Which will be the bottleneck in the future? Server capacity or network bandwidth? Æ Ranking: Better ranking schemes are needed, exploiting both content and structure (internal to a page and hyperlinks); in particular, combining and comparing query-dependent and independent techniques. One problem related to advertisements is that search engines may rank some pages higher due to reasons that are not based on the real relevance of a page (this is called the search engine persuasion problem in [543]). 9 Indexing: Which is the best logical view for the text? What should be indexed? How to exploit better text compression schemes to achieve fast searching and get lower network traffic? How to compress efficiently word lists, URL tables, etc. and update them without significant run-time penalty? Many implementation details must be improved. ï  Dynamic pages: A large number of Web pages are created on demand and current techniques are not able to search on those dynamic pages. This is called the hidden Web. Æ Duplicated data: Better mechanisms to detect and eliminate repeated Web pages (or pages that are syntactically very similar) are needed. Initial approaches are based on resemblance measures using document fingerprints [121, 120]. This is related to an important problem in databases: finding similar objects. ï  Multimedia:  Searching for non-textual objects will gain importance in the near future. There are already some research results in the literature [579, 80, 136]. ï  User interfaces: Better user interfaces are clearly needed.  The output should also be improved, for example allowing better extraction of the main content of a page or the formulation of content-based queries [766]. ï  Browsing:   More tools will appear, exploiting links, popularity of Web pages, content similarity, collaboration, 3D, and virtual reality [384, 638, 385, 421].  An important trend would be to unify further searching with browsing. An important issue to be settled in the future is a standard protocol to query search engines. One proposal for such a protocol is STARTS [316], which could allow us to choose the best sources for querying, evaluate the query at these sources, and merge the query results. This protocol would make it easier to build metasearchers, but at the same time that is one of the reasons for not having a standard. In that way, metasearchers cannot profit from the work done by search engines and Web directories. This is a particular case of the federated searching problem from heterogeneous sources as it is called in the database community [656]. This is a problem already studied in the case of the Web, including discovery and ranking of sources [161, 845, 319]. These issues are also very important for digital libraries [649] (see also Chapter 15) and visualization issues [15]. A related topic is metadata standards for the Web (see Chapter 6) BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        395 and their limitations [544]. XML helps [436, 213, 306], but semantic integration is still needed. Hyperlinks can also be used to infer information about the Web. Although this is not exactly searching the Web, this is an important trend called Web mining. Traditionally, Web mining had been focused on text mining, that is, extracting information from Web pages. However, the hyperlink structure can be exploited to obtain useful information. For example, the ParaSite system [736] uses hyperlink information to find pages that have moved, related pages, and personal Web pages. HITS, already mentioned in Section 13.4.4, has also been used to find communities and similar pages [444, 298]. Other results on exploiting hyperlink structure can be found in [639, 543, 154]. Farther improvements in this problem include Web document clustering [810, 120, 162] (already mentioned), connectivity services (for example, asking which Web pages point to a given page [92]), automatic link generation [320], extracting information [100, 115], etc. Another trend is intranet applications. Many companies do not want their private networks to be public. However, for business reasons they want to allow Web users to search inside their intranets obtaining partial information. This idea leads to the concept of portals for which there are already several commercial products. New models to see Web sites as databases and/or information systems are also important.
mir-0273	13.10    Bibliographic Discussion There are hundreds of books about the Web. Many of them include some information about searching the Web and tips for users. A recent book edited by Abrams includes a chapter on searching the Web [3]. Other sources are [682]. the special numbers of Scientific American on the Internet (March 1997) and IEEE's Internet Computing on Search Technologies (July/August 1998). For details about crawlers and other software agents see [166, 817]. In addition, the best source for references to the Web is the Web itself. To start with, there are many Web sites devoted to Inform and rate search engines and Web directories. Among them we can distinguish Search Engine Watch [749] and Search Engine Showdown [609]. A survey about Web characterizations is given by Pitkow [641] and a good directory to Web characteristics is [217]. Other Web pages provide pointers and references related to searching the Web, in particular the World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3.org), the World Wide Web journal (w3j . com) and WWW conferences. These and other pointers are available in the Web page of this book (see Chapter 1).

mir-0275	14.1    Introduction Despite the image sometimes presented of libraries as archaic collections of dusty books accessed through a card catalog, libraries were among the earliest institutions to make use of information retrieval systems. This early adoption took two main forms: searching remote electronic databases provided by commercial vendors in order to provide reference services to patrons, and the creation and searching of catalog records for materials held within the library. Each of these applications followed different developmental paths resulting in different products and functionality. According to Hildreth [372], Proceeding along different paths, the developmental histories of online public access catalogs (OPACs) and conventional information retrieval (IR) systems differed in three respects: origins of systems development, file and database content, and intended users, (p.10) Initial development of information retrieval systems was carried out by government laboratories in support of research in science and technology, based on bibliographic databases containing largely textual information, with trained search intermediaries as the intended users, OPACs were developed initially inhouse by large, usually academic, library systems, and later by commercial vendors of turnkey systems, f They used standardized record formats, generally the MARC record with minimal subject information (title, a few subject headings, and a classification number); and unlike commercial IR systems, they were intended from the outset for end users (library patrons). These factors led to significant differences between commercial IR systems and OPACs. f "Turnkey systems1 include software (and often hardware) and are usually developed with a specific library type and size in mind; within the constraints of the system, some customizing to suit the particular library is often possible. 397 398        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS Developed independently of each other, information retrieval systems and OPACs are quite different in character and use, and will be treated separately in this chapter. For these applications, a brief history, overview of current trends, some sample records and search examples will be given, and profiles of well-known systems will be presented. (Topics related to the use of IR systems in libraries, through Reference and Technical Services departments, and the techniques by which reference librarians perform the reference function, are beyond the scope of this chapter.) An important recent phenomenon, the digital library (see Chapter 15), has the potential to integrate information retrieval functions in the library under a common interface, eliminating the distinction between locally held and remote resources. Some examples of libraries which have attempted this integration will be discussed.
mir-0276	14.2    Online IR Systems and Document Databases A synergistic relationship exists between the producers and vendors of document databases^ (see Figure 14.1). In general, database producers create a product which they license to the database vendors. These vendors or search services provide search software and access to their customers, who benefit from the ability to search multiple databases from a single source. It is common to speak of the online database industry, since production of databases has usually been undertaken by corporations, organizations, or government on a for-profit or cost-recovery basis. These database producers have seen databases as products for sale or lease, often to libraries, and usually by a third party or database vendor. The role of database vendor is to license databases from their producers and add value by making them available to users. Database vendors provide some degree of standardization to the record formats, create indexes (usually in the form of inverted files), and provide a common interface for searching multiple databases. Examples of well known database vendors are DIALOG, LEXIS-NEXIS, OCLC, and H.W. Wilson; profiles are given in Figure 14.2. Some database producers choose to serve as their own search service providers, leading to a degree of vertical integration within the database industry; examples are the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which provides free access to its Medline database through the Web, and the H.W. Wilson Company, which markets its own series of databases. A significant aspect of these major commercial services is the very large size of their databases and the need for rapid, reliable service for many simultaneous users. In a description of their computing complex, LEXIS-NEXIS [510] give their database size as 1.3 billion documents, with 1.3 million subscribers, and 120 million annual searches. They return an answer set within six to ten seconds. | 'Database' is commonly used by producers and vendors of document databases when referring to their product. These databases lack the tabular structure of relational databases and contain bibliographic information and/or the full-text of documents. This usage will be followed in this chapter.

Similarly, DIALOG claims to be over 50 times the size of the Web.
mir-0277	14.2.1    Databases The history of commercial online retrieval systems begins with the creation of databases of bibliographic information in electronic form. In fact, Neufeld and Cornog claim 'databases can almost be said to have created the information industry as we now know it' [600]. Abstracting and indexing tools in printed form were available in the nineteenth century and became increasingly available in the twentieth century. Professional organizations, commercial firms, and government bodies served as publishers, selecting relevant materials from the world's literature, creating bibliographic records for them, and providing abstracts and indexing information. These databases were concentrated in the sciences, with titles such as Chemical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, and Engineering Index, but humanities (Historical Abstracts) and social sciences (PsycINFO) products soon became available. As publishers of abstracts and indexes turned to computer-assisted typesetting and printing for their products, the resulting magnetic tapes of information began to be used for information retrieval purposes. Today virtually all print abstracting and indexing products are also available in electronic form, and many new products are available solely in electronic form, without a print equivalent. As storage costs have dropped dramatically, many of these electronic databases 400        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS ï  The DIALOG Corporation DIALOG, 'the world's largest online information company,' contains about 500 databases covering a full range of subjects, including science, technology and medicine, humanities, business, and electronic newspapers. Bibliographic and full-text databases are included. Some databases are also available in CD-ROM versions for onsite searching. URL: http://www.dialog.com ï  LEXIS-NEXIS LEXIS-NEXIS markets full-text databases to the legal and business community. LEXIS provides access to 4800 legal research products including state and federal case law, statutes, and regulations. NEXIS covers over 18,000 news and business sources. URL: http://www.lexis-nexis.com ï  OCLC OCLC (the Online Computer Library Center, Inc.), which began as a bibliographic utility for cooperative cataloging of library materials, now offers access to over 70 databases and 1.5 million full-text articles. Features include an interface oriented to end-users and links to documents as well as to an inter-library loan module. URL: http://www.oclc. org/oclc/memi/f s.html ï  H.W. Wilson H.W. Wilson began producing print indexes in 1898, and now offers 40 databases to the public, school, and college library market. Wilson has electronic, CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and Web-based versions of its databases.

These are referred to as full-text databases, and include databases of journal articles and newspapers as well as reference materials such as encyclopedias and directories. Characteristics of some common databases (as available on DIALOG) are given in Figure 14.3. Databases and Indexing In general, bibliographic databases are expensive to produce, because they require rigorous selection and analysis of the documents that they cover. Some databases cover materials in a specific group of journals, others attempt to be comprehensive, collecting the world's literature within the defined subject scope. Every item must be examined for relevance to the database's goals, indexed, ONLINE IR SYSTEMS AND DOCUMENT DATABASES        401 Æ CA SEARCH: Chemical Abstracts Coverage:   bibliographical records for worldwide literature of chemistry and its applications File size: 14 million records; weekly updates of 11,000 records ï  MEdigital libraryINE Coverage: the broad field of biomedicine, including clinical and experimental medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacology, psychiatry, etc. It indexes articles from 3,700 journals worldwide File size:   about 9.5 million records;  weekly updates of 7700 records ï  New York Times - Fulltext Coverage: full-text of New York Times from 1981 to the present File size: 1.8 million records; daily updates ï  PsycINFO: Psychological Abstracts Coverage: bibliographic records for materials in psychology and related behavioral and social sciences, including psychiatry, sociology, anthropology, education, pharmacology, and linguistics; 1887 to the present File size: 1.5 million records; monthly updates of 5000 records Figure 14.3    Characteristics of some well known databases on DIALOG. abstracted, and entered in the system. Despite the promise of SGML tagging of materials by primary producers, most of this work is still done by the database producer, with a clerical staff to handle data input and subject specialists to abstract (more commonly, edit the author's abstract) and index the material. Each bibliographic database is a unique product designed to meet the information needs of a particular user group. Therefore, there is no single standard for the content of a database record. Typically, it contains tagged information that includes a record key, bibliographic data such as author, title, and source of the document, an abstract, and subject indicators such as indexing terms or category codes. In full-text databases (see Chapters 2 and 4), the text of the document is also included. Sample database records from BIOSIS PREVIEWS (Biological Abstracts) and Historical Abstracts are shown in Figures 14.4 and 14.5. Note that the vocabulary (descriptors and codes) used for subject description is very dependent on the field of study (in this case, biology and history). As these database records show, the subject information they contain is of two types: so-called "natural language' or 4free text1 information found in the title or abstract field, and terms from an indexing or controlled vocabulary which are assigned by human indexers. Most databases include indexing terms in a descriptor field, usually taken from a database-specific thesaurus (e.g., for PsycINFO, the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms). Other types of codes or indexing may be applied as relevant to the database (for instance, biosystematic 402        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS DIALOG(R)File 5:BIOSIS PREVIEWS(R) (c) 1998 BIOSIS.

DOCUMENT TYPE: ARTICLE ABSTRACT: Tells the story of the Union navy's Kearsarge, a sloop-of-war that patrolled English seas looking for Confederate commerce raiders.   Upon docking at the Irish port of Cobh (Queenstown) in November 1863, 16 locals stowed away. They were subsequently returned to Cobh, but in the meantime Captain John Winslow temporarily enlisted the men in order, he said, that they be justifiably clothed and fed, although other ship diaries indicate that the ship was short-handed and Winslow intended a real enlistment. Whatever the reality, the captain inadvertently created an international crisis since his action technically violated the British Foreign Enlistments Act. It is unclear whether Confederates plotted the incident to embarrass the Union in Britain because there are disparities between official accounts and the diaries of individual crewmen.

Prom ABC-CLIO,CA,USA. A subject of early (and ongoing) research has been the relative value of 'free text' and controlled vocabulary terms in contributing to retrieval performance. This subject was addressed in the Cranfield studies in the 1960s [415], and has continued to be examined by researchers up to the present time; good reviews of this research have been presented by Svenonius [752], Lancaster [479], and Rowley [688]. No definitive answer has been found, though later studies seem to suggest a complementarity between the two types of indexing in promoting good retrieval.
mir-0278	14.2.2    Online Retrieval Systems The use of the computer for bibliographic information retrieval was first demonstrated in the 1950s, and initiated by the National Library of Medicine in 1964 using batch processing [107]. Also in the 1960s, federally funded projects were carried out to develop prototype online systems which were then implemented in government research laboratories.   The first production service, Lockheed's 404        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS DIALOG system, was implemented for NASA and subsequently made available to other government locations before becoming a commercial activity in the early 1970s and undergoing several changes in ownership. Today DIALOG operates worldwide with databases offered via the Internet to libraries and other organizations as well as individuals. With a few exceptions, database vendors do not produce information but rather make it available to searchers via a common search interface. Database vendors license databases from the producers, process the databases to introduce as much standardization as is feasible (e.g., standard field names), mount the database through the creation of inverted indexes, create database descriptions and aids to searchers in a standard format, and conduct training sessions for clients (see Figure 14.1). These organizations offer a value-added service by providing a common gateway to multiple databases. A database vendor may offer cross-database searches; for example, DIALOG allows the searcher to search simultaneously a predetermined or searcher-selected grouping of databases to create a merged set of references, then process the set to remove duplicates.
mir-0279	14.2.3    IR in Online Retrieval Systems Since the inception of these online retrieval services, their retrieval functionality has been based primarily on the Boolean model for retrieval, in contrast to research in the IR field which has focused on improving retrieval performance through non-Boolean models, such as the vector space model (see Chapter 2). A number of factors guided the choice of the Boolean model as the basis for these services. Research in indexing and retrieval at the time, particularly the Cran-field studies, a series of experiments comparing natural and controlled vocabulary indexing, suggested that 'natural language' retrieval provided a level of retrieval performance comparable to manual indexing. Boolean logic was already being used in some libraries for manual retrieval systems, such as edge-notched cards and optical coincidence cards, and seemed to offer a natural mechanism for implementing retrieval based on combinations of words in documents. Research on alternate retrieval models was in its infancy, and the effectiveness of these models had not been proven for large databases. Most significantly, perhaps, the limited processing and storage capability of the computers of the time, while enough to support the inverted file structures and logical operations required for Boolean retrieval in an online environment, could not provide real time retrieval performance for other retrieval models which were more computationally intensive. Despite developments in IR research which suggested that alternative models might provide improved retrieval performance, Boolean retrieval has remained the commonest access method offered by database vendors, although in recent years some systems have added a form of natural language input with ranked output processing as an alternative access method. Reasons that have been suggested for the predominance of Boolean searching include financial considerations (cost of major changes in search software and database structures), service issues (a client community trained on existing systems), and lack of evidence in ONLINE IR SYSTEMS AND DOCUMENT DATABASES        405 support of viable alternatives in operational environments [662]. In general, database vendors use proprietary search software which is specific to their system, so that information professionals who search multiple systems are required to learn a different command vocabulary for each. A standard has been developed for a Common Command Language, NISO Z39.58 or ISO 8777, as described in Chapter 4, but it does not substitute for the advanced search features which are unique to individual search systems. The basic functionality for an IR search system is the ability to search for single terms or phrases, or Boolean combinations of them, to create sets of documents that can be further manipulated, then printed or displayed. Typically the system will also offer the option of using proximity operators to specify term relationships (A adjacent to B, A within n words of B, etc.) as discussed in Chapter 5, and to specify the location of the search term within the record (A occurring in title field, B occurring in the descriptor field, etc.). Of course, these capabilities require the storage of a significant amount of positional information within the inverted index. Other functions that may be available are the ability to browse the database index to select search terms (see Chapter 10) or to follow the term relationships within a database thesaurus to find candidate search terms (see Chapter 7). Other, more sophisticated functions, perhaps associated with a specific category of database, are also available, such as the ability to conduct structural searches for compounds in a chemistry database. As a term is entered by a searcher, the system creates a 'set' corresponding to all documents containing that term, and assigns a set number for the searcher's use. Multiple sets of retrieved documents are maintained in temporary storage. These set numbers serve as surrogates for the document set when issuing search commands, and Boolean logic can be used to manipulate existing sets. A display command allows the searcher to review the search history and return to previous sets. Based on data about the size of a set retrieved with search term or expression, and a review of the associated documents and their indexing, searchers continually revise a search until they feel they have achieved the best possible outcome. This iterative process is as much art as science, and its success is highly dependent on the skill and subject knowledge of the searcher. A typical Boolean search on DIALOG is shown in Figure 14.6. In this search, the user requests a specific database (file 61, Library and Information Science Abstracts) and then uses the 'Select Steps' or ss command to create sets of records. The '(w)1 represents a proximity operator, so set 5 (S5) will contain all records containing the phrases 'document retrieval' or 'text retrieval*1 or 'information retrieval.1 Set 13 (S13) will contain all records containing the term 'OPAC or the phrase 'online public access catalog.' The k?' is a truncation operator, and l? ?' limits truncation to one letter, so alternate spellings and plural of "catalog' and the singular or plural of 'OPAC will be retrieved. The two sets are combined with a Boolean AND operator, and finally the set is further limited to records that contain the terms in the title (ti) or descriptor (de) field, resulting in 100 records for review. 406        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS begin 61 File 61:LISA(LIBRARYINF0SCI)  1969-1998/May (c)	1998 Reed Reference Publishing Set	Items	Description ? ss (document or		information or text)(w)retrieval SI	7363	DOCUMENT S2	92299	INFORMATION S3	6219	TEXT S4	29302	RETRIEVAL S5	15338	(DOCUMENT OR INFORMATION OR TEXT)(W)RETRIEVAL ? ss opac?	? or online(w)public(w)access(w)catalog?

mir-0280	14.2.4    'Natural Language' Searching To ensure their place in the market, database vendors continually develop new features that they feel will be of value to their client group, as well as add new database products. In general, these new features are augmentations to the existing Boolean search engine ó removal of duplicates, sophisticated ranking or sorting within the retrieved set. However, about five years ago several of the major database vendors announced they were adding 'natural language' search functionality to their systems. WESTLAW (a legal resources vendor) introduced its WIN system, DIALOG offered TARGET, and LEXIS-NEXIS announced a system called FREESTYLE [758, 653]. WIN and FREESTYLE accept a natural language query; TARGET requires the searcher to eliminate terms that are not useful for searching. All three systems provide ranked lists of retrieved documents. The 'natural language' systems are offered as auxiliary modules to standard Boolean searching, and are not intended to replace it. A sample TARGET search is shown in Figure 14.7. In this search in BIOSIS, the searcher is first provided with a series of instructions on dealing with phrases, synonyms, etc. The searcher enters a series of search terms {up to 25) at the k?* prompt, in this case 'komodo dragon food ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGS (OPACS)        407 ? target Input search, terms separated by spaces (e.g., DOG CAT FOOD). You can enhance your TARGET search with the following options: - PHRASES are enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'DOG FOOD') - SYNONYMS are enclosed in parentheses (e.g., (DOG CANINE)) - SPELLING variations are indicated with a ? (e.g., DOG? to search DOG, DOGS) - Terms that MUST be present are flagged with an asterisk (e.g., DOG *F0OD) Q = QUIT  H = HELP ? komodo dragon food diet nutrition Your TARGET search request will retrieve up to 50 of the statistically most relevant records.

By default the search is limited to the most recent two years of the file, and the 50 highest scoring records are available for display in ranked order. In this example no restrictions are made on the search terms but as the on-screen instructions indicate, Boolean logic can be imposed on the search terms, resulting in a Boolean search with ranked output.
mir-0281	14.3    Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) Library catalogs serve as lists of the library's holdings, organized as finding tools for the collection. For many years the card catalog served this function, and later computer-produced catalogs in book, microfilm, and microfiche form. Online catalogs were implemented in libraries during the 1970s, although these first catalogs were usually modules linked to the automated circulation system and had brief catalog records and very limited functionality. (The circulation system was the first component of what are now called library management systems (LMSs) or integrated library systems (ILSs) to be introduced). By the 1980s, true online public access catalogs had been implemented. Hildreth [372] has described the history of online catalogs by classifying them according to three generations. In the first generation, OPACs were largely known-item finding tools, typically searchable by author, title, and control number, and contained relatively short, non-standard bibliographic records. As is typical of technologies in their infancy, they were basically an old technology (the card catalog) in an automated form. In the second generation, increased search functionality included access by subject headings and, latterly, keyword, 408        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS some basic Boolean search capability, and ability to browse subject headings. Second generation catalogs also offered a choice of display formats (e.g., short, medium, long) and improved usability (for instance, different dialogs for novices and experts, more informative error messages, etc.). According to Hildreth, problems with second generation systems included failed searches, navigational confusion, problems with the subject indexing vocabulary and excessively large, badly organized retrieval sets. Needed enhancements for third generation systems, as delineated by Hildreth, included search strategy assistance, integrated free text/controlled vocabulary approaches, augmented cataloging records, cross-database access, natural language input, individualized displays and context-sensitive error correction. For many years library catalogs remained on what Hildreth referred to as the 'second generation plateau.' One of the barriers to innovation in OPAC development has been the cost of developing new systems and the need for a reliable customer base. Prom the perspective of the library, selecting and migrating to a new system is a costly process, and with library budgets traditionally squeezed, libraries have been cautious in selecting new and untried systems. They have learned to be wary of the 'it's in the next release; syndrome, while system developers have required a stable customer base to fund new systems. Third generation systems are now appearing, and with features not envisioned by Hildreth, who was speaking in a pre-Web environment. The availability of electronic resources on the Web has blurred the distinction between local and global resources, and between cataloging information and other electronic databases. According to a recent vendor survey [632], Automated system vendors have a vested interest in the transition of libraries to a mixed digital/print environment. Many see their own survival dependent upon their ability to help libraries thrive in this mixed arena, (p.47) Therefore, much of the emphasis in recent library systems development has been on the deployment of functionality for library management systems within new open systems architectures [351]. Features appearing in these new systems include improved graphical user interfaces (GUIs), support for Z39.50, electronic forms, hypertext links and Dublin Core (a developing metadata standard for multimedia materials), and incorporation of Java programming. Systems are also beginning to move beyond the basic Boolean search functionality, and some, like EGSFs Q series (described in section 14.3.3) have advanced search features.
mir-0282	14.3.1    OPACs and Their Content Libraries use standardized systems for cataloging and classifying the materials (texts and other media) they hold. Typically, they follow the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules to describe these materials, an organizational scheme (such as Library of Congress or the Dewey Decimal Classification) to assign subject codes, and use a subject heading list (such as the Library of Congress Subject ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGS (OPACS)        409 00723cam    22002418a 4500001001300000008004100013005001700054 010001800071020003300089040001300122050002600135082001700161 100002000178245007400198250001200272260005200284300003400336 504006400370650004100434 97002718 970417sl997        ilua         b        001 0 eng 19971128134653.1 $a      97002718 $a0838907075  (acid-free paper) $adigital libraryC$cdigital libraryC 00$aZ699.35.M28$bH34  1997 00$a025.3/16$221 1 $aHagler,  Ronald. 14$aThe bibliographic record and information technology / $cRonald Hagler. $a3rd ed. $aChicago   :$bAmerican Library Association,$cl997. $axvi,   394 p.   :$bill.   ;$c24 cm. $alncludes bibliographical references   (p.375-380) and index. 650    0041        0$aMachine-readable bibliographic data.# 001	0013 008	0041 005	0017 010	0018 020	0033 040	0013 050	0026 082	0017 100	0020 245	0074 250	0012 260	0052 300	0034 504	0064 Figure 14.8    Sample MARC record. Headings) to assign a series of subject descriptors. Given this standardization, cooperative cataloging ventures by library consortia have the potential to lower the cost per unit to catalog library materials, broaden access through shared databases, and facilitate the sharing of materials. Thus library cataloging relies on centralized and shared information through bibliographic utilities such as the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). (OCLC is also a database vendor with characteristics shown in Figure 14.2.) The structure that underlies this cooperation among many libraries supporting distinct online catalogs is the MARC Record. MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging Record) is a data format that implements national and international standards, such as the Information Interchange Format (ANSI Z39.2) and the Format for Information Exchange (ISO 2709). With some variations (USMARC, UKMARC, etc.) it is used worldwide. A sample MARC record is shown in Figure 14.8. The MARC record has three parts: a fixed length (24 character) leader; a record directory showing the 3-digit tag for each field contained in the record with the length of that field in characters; and the data-containing fields and subfields themselves. Subfields are indicated by codes (e.g., ($a') within the field and are specific to each field. For instance, field 260 contains publication information and may have subfields for place, publisher, and date. (To improve readability the record here has been reformatted slightly, so that the field tag (e.g., 001) and field length (e.g., 0013) from the directory are repeated with the data for each field). A recent innovation is the adoption of the 856 field for holdings information to include URLs, allowing the specification of Web hyperlinks. 410        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS
mir-0283	14.3.2    OPACs and End Users Probably the greatest challenge for designers of OPACs is to create usable systems. OPACs are found in every type of library, and while users of research libraries might be expected to be knowledgeable about library practices in organizing and accessing information, elsewhere the end user could as easily be a schoolchild, college undergraduate, or patron of a local public library with little or no formal training in library use (what Borgman calls 'perpetual novices' [105]). The underlying record structure (the MARC record) is detailed and complex, and the organizational structures (LCSH, LC classification scheme) are far from intuitive. The most common type of searching in OPACs is subject searching, and failures by users in topical searching are well documented [484]. Common failures are null sets ('zero results'), or at the other extreme, information overload in which more references are retrieved than can easily be examined [484]. According to one study of transaction logs for the MELVYL catalog [252], 82% of in-library users had a zero retrieval for one or more searches. Interestingly, over 25% of users continued their search through ten or more tries, and another 25% did not appear to retrieve any useful information. Writing in 1986, Borgman [104] raised the question, 'Why are online catalogs hard to use?/ and in 1996, revisited the problem with kWhy are online catalogs still hard to use?' [105]. She argues the reason is that they do not incorporate knowledge about user behavior, and place too heavy a burden on the searcher for query specification. Greater contextual assistance for searchers has been suggested by a number of researchers [105, 252, 371].
mir-0284	14.3.3    OPACs: Vendors and Products The OPAC market is a specialized one, and products are developed and marketed by a limited number of vendors who compete for market position. While it is rare to find a library of any size that does not have a library management system, libraries are constantly in a state of flux, upgrading their systems as old ones become obsolete or unsupported, and introducing new systems. For example, many academic libraries had OPACs based on the venerable mainframe-based NOTIS software, and have undertaken to identify a suitable replacement. Most of the vendors target niche markets: academic libraries, public libraries, and school and special libraries. Profiles of three such vendors are found in Figure 14.9. Fuller details of these and other systems can be found in [351] and [61].
mir-0285	14.3.4    Alternatives to Vendor OPACs While early OPACs were developed inhouse, sometimes by enthusiastic amateurs at considerable expenditure of time and money, and a significant risk of failure, ONLINE PUBLIC ACCESS CATALOGS (OPACS)        411 Æ Endeavor Information Systems, Inc. With a significant academic library clientele, Endeavor has replaced a number of NOTIS systems. Its system, Voyager, is based on a multi-tier architecture with Oracle as the DBMS. The public access client and server are Z39.50 compliant. The search engine supports natural language queries and relevance ranking to display results.

Its newest system, Millennium, is based on its INNOPAC library management system but adds a thin client architecture with modules developed in Java.

URL: http://www.eosintl.com Figure 14.9    Library management system vendors. today's environment supports turnkey systems developed by a third party. However, there are some instances of systems developed with a research focus for implementation in academic libraries. Notable examples are the Okapi system [416] at City University, London, MARIAN [264] at Virginia Tech, the MELVYL system at the University of California [526], and the Cheshire II system [486] for a UC Berkeley branch library. The Cheshire II system was designed for the UC Berkeley Mathematics, Statistics and Astronomy library using standards such as Z39.50 and SGML. It provides integrated access to bibliographic, full-text and multimedia resources. The search engine offers both probabilistic ranking and Boolean searches, which can be combined in a single search. Cheshire II was designed as a research as well as an operational environment, and issues such as combining probabilistic and 412        LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS Boolean models, and design of the client interface to support searching with a variety of Z39.50 servers while minimizing cognitive overload on searchers [486].
mir-0286	14.4    Libraries and Digital Library Projects Libraries are concerned with enhanced, seamless access to electronic information from all sources. These libraries [351] see the library's Web pages, not the OPAC, as the entry point for library users. Through the web pages the user gains access to the library catalog, networked information resources, and locally created information, (p.5) Through the Web, a single interface can provide access to the local OPAC and reference materials, as well as to remotely accessible databases in the sciences, humanities, and business, including full-text journals, newspapers, and directories. Special collections, in multimedia as well as text formats, become available to the user through the same gateway. Many libraries, particularly academic and large public libraries, have undertaken digital library projects to achieve interoperability, ease of use, and equity of access (see Chapter 15). Two such projects, the Los Angeles Public Library's Virtual Electronic Library project (http://www.lapl.org), and University of Pennsylvania's Digital Library (http://www.library.upenn.edu) are described in [351]. The Web not only provides integration in terms of resources and collections, but the accompanying standards which support interoperability lead to a uniform search architecture. With this approach, the traditional distinction between information retrieval from OPACs and from remote electronic databases is beginning to disappear.
mir-0287	14.5    Trends arid Research Issues With a few exceptions, librarians are consumers of information systems, whether information retrieval systems provided by database vendors, or turnkey OPACs. Even in the digital library environment, their emphasis is on providing integrated access to a diversity of modules for information retrieval. Their interest therefore is in obtaining and using systems which offer ease of integration in their automated environment, and ease of use for themselves and their patrons. The former goal is approached through standards such as SGML and Z39.50, and the development and application of these standards is an important trend in the design of IR systems for libraries. For the latter goal, ease of use. the trend toward user-centered research and design is significant because it offers the potential to answer Bergman's query, 'Why are online catalogs still hard to use?' [105]. Much of the recent research interest is in cognitive and behavioral BIBLIOGRAPHIC DISCUSSION        413 issues (as reviewed in [482]). Developing an understanding of information need, either in general or for a specific client group, has been an important component of this work. Researchers are also interested in the searching behavior of users. Obviously, there is no single 'user' group, and studies have focused on groups such as trained intermediaries, children, and subject specialists, in both the search service and OPAC environment. One such project conducted over two years is the Getty Online Search Project which studied the end user search behavior of humanities scholars [67]. The interest in end user behavior also extends to an examination of relevance, since an understanding of the criteria by which users determine if retrieved information meets their information need is critical to achieving user-centered design.
mir-0288	14.6    Bibliographic Discussion The early history of online databases and systems makes interesting reading, and Hahn's 'Pioneers of the Online Age' is a good place to start [331]. The early history of online systems is also described by Bourne [107], and the history of electronic databases by Neufeld and Cornog [600]. The current status of the online industry is profiled annually in the May 1 issue of Library Journal (see, for example, [757]). An overview of research issues in OPACs is provided by Large and Beheshti [482]. A 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Society for Information Science was a special topic issue on 'Current Research in Online Public Access Systems' [68]. Comparative information on OPACs (and other library management system software) is readily available. A Council on Library and Information Resources report profiles 12 major vendors and their products [351]. The April 1 issue of Library Journal each year includes an 'Automated System Marketplace" update which discusses trends in library management systems, provides company and product information, and tabulates sales. Library Technology Reports frequently publishes 'consumer reports' of online systems; for instance, one issue was devoted to a survey of Z39.50 clients [813]. Recent monographs by Allen [13] and Marchionini [542] address the issues of user-centered design and electronic information seeking behavior.
mir-0290	15.1    Introduction Information retrieval is essential for the success of digital libraries (digital librarys), so they can achieve high levels of effectiveness while at the same time affording ease of use to a diverse community. Accordingly, a significant portion of the research and development efforts related to digital librarys has been in the IR area. This chapter reviews some of these efforts, organizes them into a simple framework, and highlights needs for the future. Those interested in a broader overview of the field are encouraged to refer to the excellent book by Lesk [501] and the high quality papers in proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries Conferences. Those more comfortable with online information should refer to D-Lib Magazine [280]; the publications of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 'Research on Digital Libraries Initiative7 (digital libraryI) [349]; or online courseware [268]. There also have been special issues of journals devoted to the topic [265, 267, 710]. Recently, it has become clear that a global focus is needed [270] to extend beyond publications that have a regional [55] or national emphasis [221]. Many people's views of digital librarys are built from the foundation of current libraries [683]. Capture and conversion (digitization) are key concerns [160], but digital librarys are more than digital collections [634]. It is very important to understand the assumptions adopted in this movement towards digital librarys [509] and, in some cases, to relax them [29]. Futuristic perspectives of libraries have been a key part of the science fiction literature [811] as well as rooted in visionary statements that led to much of the work in IR and hypertext [135]. digital librarys have been envisaged since the earliest days 415 416        DIGITAL LIBRARIES of the IR field. Thus, in Libraries of the Future, Licklider lays out many of the challenges, suggests a number of solutions, and clearly calls for IR-related efforts [516]. He describes and predicts a vast expansion of the world of publishing, indicating the critical need to manage the record of knowledge, including search, retrieval, and all the related supporting activities. He notes that to handle this problem we have no underlying theory, no coherent representation scheme, no unification of the varied approaches of different computing specialties ó and so must tackle it from a number of directions. After more than 30 years of progress in computing, we still face these challenges and work in this field as a segmented community, viewing digital librarys from one or another perspective: database management, human-computer interaction (HCI), information science, library science, multimedia information and systems, natural language processing, or networking and communications. As can be seen in the discussion that follows, this practice has led to progress in a large number of separate projects, but has also made interoperability one of the most important problems to solve [624]. Since one of the threads leading to the current interest in digital librarys came out of discussions of the future of IR [264], since people's needs still leave a rich research agenda for the IR community [197], and since the important role of Web search systems demonstrates the potential value of IR in digital librarys [711], it is appropriate to see how IR may expand its horizons to deal with the key problems of digital librarys and how it can provide a unifying and integrating framework for the digital library field. Unfortunately, there is little agreement even regarding attempts at integrating database management and text processing approaches [325]. Sometimes, though, it is easier to solve a hard problem if one takes a broader perspective and solves a larger problem. Accordingly we briefly and informally introduce the k5S' model as a candidate solution and a way to provide some theoretical and practical unification for digital librarys. We argue that digital librarys in particular, as well as many other types of information systems, can be described, modeled, designed, implemented, used, and evaluated if we move to the foreground five key abstractions: streams, structures, spaces, scenarios, and societies. 'Streams' have often been used to describe texts, multimedia content, and other sequences of abstract items, including protocols, interactive dialogs, server logs, and human discussions. 'Structures' cover data structures, databases, hypertext networks, and all of the IR constructs such as inverted files, signature files, MARC records (see Chapter 8 for more details), and thesauri. "Spaces" cover not only ID, 2D, 3D, virtual reality, and other multidimensional forms, some including time, but also vector spaces, probability spaces, concept spaces, and results of multidimensional scaling or latent-semantic indexing. 'Scenarios' not only cover stories, HCI designs and specifications, and requirements statements, but also describe processes, procedures, functions, services, and transformations ó the active and time-spanning aspects of digital librarys. Scenarios have been essential to our understanding of different digital library user communities" needs [525], and are particularly important in connection with social issues [48]. 'Societies' cover these concerns especially regarding authors, librarians, annotators, and other stakeholders. For the sake of brevity we omit further DEFINITIONS        417 direct discussion of this abstraction, especially since anthropologists, communication researchers, psychologists, sociologists, and others are now engaging in digital library research. Since the 5S model can be used to describe work on databases, HCI, hyper-bases, multimedia systems, and networks, as well as other fields related to library and information science, we refer to it below to help unify our coverage and make sure that it encompasses all aspects of digital librarys. For example, the 5S model in general, and scenarios in particular, may help us move from a paper-centered framework for publishing and communicating knowledge [195] to a hybrid paper/electronic one with a variety of streams and spaces. The 5S model is a simple way to organize our thinking and understand some of the changes that digital librarys will facilitate: The boundaries between authors, publishers, libraries, and readers evolved partly in response to technology, particularly the difficulty and expense of creating and storing paper documents. New technologies can shift the balance and blur the boundaries. [525] To ground these and other subsequent discussions, then, we explore a number of definitions of digital librarys, using 5S to help us see what is missing or emphasized in each.
mir-0291	15.2    Definitions Since digital library is a relatively new field, many workshops and conferences continue to have sessions and discussions to define a 'digital library' [266, 347]. Yet, defining digital librarys truly should occur in the context of other related entities and practices [315]. Thus, a 'digital archive' is like a digital library, but often suggests a particular combination of space and structure, and emphasizes the scenario of preservation, as in 'digital preservation' that is based upon digitization of artifacts. Similarly, 'electronic preservation' calls for media migration and format conversions to make digital librarys immune to degradation and technological obsolescence. Maintaining integrity' in a digital library requires ensuring authenticity, handled by most regular libraries, as well as consistency, which is a concern whenever one must address replication and versioning, as occurs in database systems and in distributed information systems. While these concerns are important, we argue that 'digital library1 is a broader concept. Because it is true that the 'social, economic, and legal questions are too important to be ignored in the research agenda in digital libraries' [525], we really prefer definitions that have communities of users (societies)  as part of a digital library: digital librarys are constructed ó collected and organized ó by a community of users. Their functional capabilities support the information needs and uses of that community. digital library is an extension, enhancement, and integration of a variety of information institutions as physical places where resources are selected, collected, organized, preserved, and accessed in support of a user community. [48] 418        DIGITAL LIBRARIES This definition has many aspects relating to 5S, but largely omits streams, and only indirectly deals with spaces by calling for extensions beyond physical places. Its coverage of scenarios is weak, too, only giving vague allusion to user support. In contrast, definitions that emphasize functions and services are of particular importance to the development community [299], as are definitions concerned with distributed multimedia information systems: The generic name for federated structures that provide humans both intellectual and physical access to the huge and growing worldwide networks of information encoded in multimedia digital formats. [97] While brief, this definition does tie closely with 5S, though it is weak on scenarios, only mentioning the vague and limited concept of 'access.' To the IR community a digital library can be viewed as an extended IR system, in the context of federation and media variations [48]. Also, digital librarys must support (large) collections of documents, searching, and cataloging/indexing. They bring together in one place all aspects of 5S, and many of the concerns now faced by IR researchers: multilingual processing, search on multimedia content, information visualization, handling large distributed collections of complex documents, usability, standards, and architectures, all of which are explored in the following sections.
mir-0292	15.3    Architectural Issues Since digital librarys are part of the global information infrastructure, many discussions of them focus on high level architectural issues [611]. On the one hand, digital librarys can be just part of the 'middleware' of the Internet, providing various services that can be embedded in other task-support systems. In this regard they can be treated separately from their content, allowing development to proceed without entanglement in problems of economics, censorship, or other social concerns. On the other hand, digital librarys can be independent systems and so must have an architecture of their own in order to be built. Thus, many current digital librarys are cobbled together from pre-existing pieces, such as search engines, Web browsers, database management systems, and tools for handling multimedia documents. From either perspective, it is helpful to extend definitions into more operational forms that can lead to specification of protocols when various components are involved. Such has been one of the goals of efforts at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), as illustrated in Figure 15.1. Thus, Kahn and Wilensky proposed one important framework [426]. Anns et at have extended this work into digital library architectures [28, 31]. One element is a digital object, which has content (bits) and a handle (a type of name or identifier) [189], and also may have properties, a signature, and a log of transactions that involve it. Digital objects have associated metadata, that can be managed in sets [472]. Repositories of digital objects can provide security and can respond to a repository access protocol [30]. Significant progress has been niade toward adopting a scheme of digital object identifiers, first illustrated by the Online Handles are used to access Digital Objects ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES        419 Handle system Repository Handle__ (metadata) Signature -(optional) Signature ó (optional) 1 Transaction log Digital Object Digital Object Handle(metadata)	X Properties j----- Content ógt; (bits)		222		wm	¶i Signature-----* (optional)	ó	_	ó 1 Transaction log Handle Digital Object Content -(bits) Signature ó (optional) J Transacti ion log I Handle Digital Object Signature ó (optional) 1 Transaction log Digital Object Security provided by Repository Figure 15.1    Digital objects, handles, and repositories (adapted from [428, 28, 31, 30]). 420        DIGITAL LIBRARIES Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLCs) Persistent URLs (PURLs) [654], and agreement seems likely on a standard for Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) [396]. Other implementation efforts have focused more on services [473] and security [475]. A useful testbed for this work has been computer science reports [210], most recently through the Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library, NCSTRL [471]. Two large Digital Libraries Initiative (digital libraryI) projects have devoted a good deal of attention to architecture, taking radically different approaches. At Stanford, the key concern has been interoperability [624]. Their 'InfoBus' [625] allows a variety of information resources to be connected through suitable mediators and then used via the shared bus through diverse interfaces. At the University of Michigan, the emphasis has been on agent technologies [97]. This approach can have a number of classes of entities involved in far-flung distributed processing. It is still unknown how efficiently an agent-based digital library can operate or even be built. Ultimately, software to use in digital librarys will be selected as a result of comparisons. One basis for such comparisons is the underlying conceptual model [820]. Another basis is the use of metrics, which is the subject of recent efforts towards definition and consensus building [499]. In addition to metrics traditionally used in IR, dealing with efficiency, effectiveness, and usability, a variety of others must be selected, according to agreed-upon scenarios. Also important to understand is the ability of digital librarys to handle a variety of document types (combinations of streams and structures), to accurately and economically represent their content and relationships (structures), and to support a range of access approaches and constraints (scenarios).
mir-0293	15.4    Document Models, Representations, and Access Without documents there would be no IR or digital librarys. Hence, it is appropriate to consider definitions of 'document' [709], and to develop suitable formalizations [508], as well as to articulate research concerns [505]. For efficiency purposes, especially when handling millions of documents and gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes of space, compression is crucial [825]. While that is becoming more manageable, converting very large numbers of documents using high quality representations [151] can be prohibitively expensive, especially relative to the costs of retrieval, unless items are popular. All of these matters relate to the view of a document as a stream (along with one or more organizing structures); alternatively one can use scenarios to provide focus on the usage of documents. These problems shift, and sometimes partially disappear, when one considers the entire life cycle and social context of a document [124, 353] or when digital librarys become an integral part of automation efforts that deal with workflow and task support for one or more document collections.
mir-0294	15.4.1    Multilingual Documents One social issue with documents relates to culture and language [633]. Whereas there are many causes of the movement toward English as a basis for global DOCUMENT MODELS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND ACCESS        421 scientific and technical interchange, digital librarys may actually lead to an increase in availability of non-English content. Because digital librarys can be constructed for a particular institution or nation, it is likely that the expansion of digital librarys will increase access to documents in a variety of languages. Some of that may occur since many users of information desire it from all appropriate sources, regardless of origin, and so will wish to carry out a parallel (federated) search across a (distributed) multilingual collection. The key aspects of this matter are surveyed in [613]. At the foundation, there are issues of character encoding. Unicode provides a single 16-bit coding scheme suitable for all natural languages [783]. However, a less costly implementation may result from downloading fonts as needed from a special server or gateway, or from a collection of such gateways, one for each special collection [208]. The next crucial problem is searching multilingual collections. The simplest approach is to locate words or phrases in dictionaries and to use the translated terms to search in collections in other languages [387]. However, properly serving many users in many languages calls for more sophisticated processing [612]. It is likely that research in this area will continue to be of great importance to both the IR and digital library communities.
mir-0295	15.4.2    Multimedia Documents Prom the 5S perspective, we see that documents are made up of one or more streams, often with a structure imposed (e.g., a raster organization of a pixel stream represents a color image). Multimedia documents' streams usually must be synchronized in some way, and so it is promising that a new standard for handling this over the Web has been adopted [379]. At the same time, as discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, IR has been applied to various types of multimedia content. Thus, at Columbia University, a large image collection from the Web can be searched on content using visual queries [158]. IBM developed the Query By Image Content (QBIC) system for images and video [257] and has generously helped build a number of important image collections to preserve and increase access to key antiquities [300]. Similarly, the Carnegie Mellon University digital libraryI project, Informedia [146], has focused on video content analysis, word spotting, summarization, search, and in-context results presentation [146]. Better handling of multimedia is at the heart of future research on many types of documents in digital librarys [354]. Indeed, to properly handle the complexity of multimedia collections, very powerful representation, description, query and retrieval systems, such as those built upon logical inference [283], may be required.
mir-0296	15.4.3    Structured Documents While multimedia depends on the stream abstraction, structured documents require both the abstractions of streams and structures. Indeed, structured documents in their essence are streams with one or more structures imposed. 422        DIGITAL LIBRARIES often by the insertion of markup in the stream, but sometimes through a separate external structure, like pointers in hypertext. Since Chapter 6 of this book covers many of the key issues of document structure, we focus in this section on issues of particular relevance to digital librarys [288]. For example, since digital librarys typically include both documents and metadata describing them, it is important to realize that metadata as in MARC records can be represented as an SGML document (see Chapter 6 for more details) and that SGML content can be included in the base document and/or be kept separately [293]. Structure is often important in documents when one wants to add value or make texts 'smart' [167]. It can help identify important concepts [626]. SGML is often used to describe structure since most documents fall into one or more common logical structures [750], that can be formally described using a Document Type Definition (DTD). Another type of structure that is important in digital librarys, as well as earlier paper forms, results from annotation [548]. In this case stream and structure are supplemented by scenarios since annotations result from users interacting with a document collection, as well as collaborating with each other through these shared artifacts [680]. Structure is also important in retrieval. Macleod was one of the first to describe special concerns related to IR involving structured documents [533]. Searching on structure as well as content remains one of the distinguishing advantages of IR systems like OpenText (formerly 'PAT' [38]). Ongoing work considers retrieval with structured documents, such as with patterns and hierarchical texts [439]. An alternative approach, at the heart of much of the work in the Berkeley digital libraryI project [775], shifts the burden of handling structure in documents to the user, by allowing multiple layers of filters and tools to operate on so-called 'multivalent documents' [774]. Thus, a page image including a table can be analyzed with a table tool that understands the table structure and sorts it by considering the values in a user-selected column. Structure at the level above documents, that is, of collections of documents, is what makes searching necessary and possible. It also is a defining characteristic of digital librarys, especially when the collections are distributed.
mir-0297	15.4.4    Distributed Collections Though our view of digital librarys encompasses even those that are small, self-contained, and constrained to a personal collection with a suitable system and services, most digital librarys are spread across computers, that is spanning physical and/or logical spaces. Dealing with collections of information that are distributed in nature is one of the common requirements for digital library technology. Yet, proper handling of such collections is a challenging problem, possibly since many computer scientists are poorly equipped to think about situations involving spaces as well as the other aspects of 5S. Of particular concern is working with a number of digital librarys, each separately constructed, so the information systems are truly heterogeneous. Integration requires support for at least some popular scenarios (often a simple search that DOCUMENT MODELS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND ACCESS        423 External Servers Figure 15.2    Architecture of the BioKleisli system (adapted from [829, 128]). is a type of least common denominator) by systems that expect differing types of communication streams (e.g., respond to different protocols and query languages), have varying types of streams and structures, and combine these two differently in terms of representations of data and metadata. To tackle this problem, one approach has been to develop a description language for each digital library and to build federated search systems that can interpret that description language [161]. However, when digital library content is highly complex (e.g., when there are 'unstructured' collections, meaning that the structure is complex and not well described), there is need for richer description languages and more powerful systems to interpret and support highly expressive queries/operations [828, 209, 128]. An architecture of this type is illustrated in Figure 15.2 for the BioKleisli system [829]. In addition to these two approaches - namely reducing functionality for end users in order to give digital library developers more freedom and increasing functionality by making the federated system smarter and able to use more computational resources on both servers and clients - there is the third approach of making each digital library support a powerful protocol aimed at effective retrieval. This third course is supported by the Computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) effort [570], wherein a Z39.50 interface exists on a number of museum information servers and clients [570]. While Z39.50 was aimed at the needs of libraries desiring interoperability among library catalogs, it does support many of the needs for digital librarys. Thus, the CIMI interoperability demonstration, with its support for multimedia content, is of great import, but does leave open further improvement 424        DIGITAL LIBRARIES in supporting richer digital library interaction scenarios, involving more powerful federated searchers.
mir-0298	15.4.5    Federated Search Federated search work has often been prompted by challenging application requirements. For example, to allow computer science technical reports from around the world to become accessible with minimal investment and maximal local control, the NSF-funded Wide Area TEchnical Report Service (WATERS) initiative was launched [279]. This was then integrated with an effort begun earlier with DARPA funding, the Computer Science Technical Report (CSTR) project [260], leading to a hybrid effort, the Networked CS Technical Reference (previously, Report) Library (NCSTRL) [471]. At the heart of NC-STRL is a simple search system, a well-thought-out open federated digital library protocol and the Dienst reference implementation, developed at Cornell University [210]. While this system was custom-built with little dependence on other software, its type of operation could be constructed more rapidly atop various supports like CORBA [788]. Federated search has had an interesting history, with workers adopting a variety of approaches. First, there are those interested in collecting the required information, often through Web crawling of various sorts [715]. Second, there are those focusing on intelligent search [27]. One example is work emphasizing picking the best sites to search [126]. These efforts often assume some integrated information organization across the distributed Internet information space [393]. Third, there is work on fusion of results. This can be viewed in the abstract, regardless of whether the various collections are nearby or distributed, with the target of improving retrieval by culling from a number of good sources [76]. One approach adopts a probabilistic inference network model [139]. Another views the problem as database merging [791]. Alternatively, one can assume that there are a number of search engines distributed to cover the collection, that must be used intelligently [292]. Fourth, there are commercial solutions, including through special Web services [223]. Probably the most visible is the patented, powerful yet elegant, approach by Infoseek Corporation [394]. Finally, there is a new line of work to develop comprehensive and realistic architectures for federated search [219, 218]. The long-term challenge is to segment the collection and/or its indexes so that most searches only look at a small number of the most useful sources of information, yet recall is kept high. Ultimately, however, there are rich types of use of digital library content, once one of these approaches to search is carried out.
mir-0299	15.4.6    Access When priceless objects are described by digital library image collections [300], when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users, or when there are valuable services in information manipulation (searching, ordering, reporting, summarizing, etc.)   afforded by a digital library, some method PROTOTYPES, PROJECTS, AND INTERFACES        425 of payment is often required [194, 191, 49, 251]. Though previously access to scientific literature was not viewed as a commodity as it is today [328], digital librarys clearly must manage intellectual property [559]. These services must support agreed-upon principles [586], copyright practices [705], as well as contracts and other agreements and laws [346]. Though technology is only part of the picture [822], a key to the implementation of policies for access management [30] is having trusted systems [746]. Security is one topic often ignored by the IR community. However, many aspects of security can be of fundamental importance in digital librarys [302, 301]. Just as encryption is essential to support electronic commerce, watermarking and stronger mechanisms are crucial in digital librarys to protect intellectual property rights and to control the types of access afforded to different user groups. Scenarios are important here, to ensure that suitable constraints are imposed on processing, all the way from input to output. For example, secret documents may not even be made visible in searches through metadata. On the other hand, advertising full documents as well as allowing locating and viewing metadata records is appropriate when the purpose of security is to enforce payment in ;pay by the drink' document downloading systems. Inference systems can be used for complicated rights management situations [16]. A deeper understanding of these requirements and services can be obtained by considering representative digital library projects, such as those mentioned in the next section.
mir-0300	15.5    Prototypes, Projects, and Interfaces Though numerous efforts in the IR, hypertext, multimedia, and library automation areas have been underway for years as precursors of today's digital library systems, one of the first new efforts aimed at understanding the requirements for digital librarys and constructing a prototype from scratch was the ENVISION project, launched in 1991 [269]. Based on discussions with experts in the field and a careful study of prospective users of the computer science collection to be built with the assistance of ACM, the ENVISION system was designed to extend the MARIAN search system [264] with novel visualization techniques [273, 360]. Careful analysis has shown its 2D approach to management of search results is easy to use and effective for a number of digital library activities [610]. The CORE project, another early effort, is an electronic library prototype on chemical journal articles. Its collection included, for each article, both scanned images and an SGML marked-up version, as well as indexes for full-text Boolean searching. It was undertaken by the American Chemical Society, Chemical Abstracts Service, OCLC, Bellcore, and Cornell University, along with other partners [237]. This project also was concerned with collection building as well as testing of a variety of interfaces that were designed based on user studies. One of the most visible project efforts is the Digital Libraries Initiative, initially supported by NSF, DARPA, and NASA [349]. Phase 1 provided funding for six large projects over the period 1994-1998. These projects spanned a wide 426        DIGITAL LIBRARIES range of major topics in developing the National Information Infrastructure (Nil) and addressed future technological problems. The Illinois project [777] focused on manually structured text documents in full systems with many users; the Berkeley project [775] emphasized automatically recognized image documents, also with large systems. The Santa Barbara [776] and Carnegie Mellon [146] projects investigated the ability to manipulate new media; Carnegie Mellon focused on segmenting and indexing video using speech recognition and program structure, and Santa Barbara concentrated on indexing maps using image processing and region metadata. Stanford [745] and Michigan [784] investigated the intermediaries to perform operations on large digital libraries; Stanford investigated interoperability of different search services, and Michigan concentrated on interacting software agents to provide services to users [710]. Since these projects have been described elsewhere in depth, it should suffice here to highlight some of the connections of those projects with the IR community. First, each project has included a component dealing with document collections. The Illinois project produced SGML versions of a number of journals while the Berkeley project concentrated on page images and other image classes. Santa Barbara adopted a spatial perspective, including satellite imagery, while Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) focused on video. Stanford built no collections, but rather afforded access to a number of information sources to demonstrate interoperability. At the University of Michigan, some of the emphasis was on having agents dynamically select documents from a distributed set of resources. Second, the digital libraryI projects all worked on search. Text retrieval, and using automatically constructed cross-vocabulary thesauri to help find search terms, was emphasized in Illinois. Image searching was studied at Berkeley and Santa Barbara while video searching was investigated at CMU. Michigan worked with agents for distributed search while Stanford explored the coupling of a variety of architectures and interfaces for retrieval. Finally, it is important to note that the digital libraryI efforts all spent time on interface issues. Stanford used animation and data flows to provide flexible manipulation and integration of services [192]. At Michigan, there were studies of the PAD+4- approach to 2D visualization [70]. Further discussion of interfaces can be found below in subsection 15.5.2. It should be noted that these projects only partially covered the 5S issues. Structures were not well studied, except slightly in connection with the Illinois work on SGML and the Berkeley work on databases. Scenarios were largely ignored, except in some of the interface investigations. Similarly, spaces were not investigated much, except in connection with the vocabulary transfer work at Illinois and the spatial collection and browsing work at Santa Barbara. Other projects in the broader international scene, some of which are discussed in the next section, may afford more thorough 5S coverage. Since the announcement of digital libraryL activities and interest related to digital libraries have increased dramatically. The six digital libraryI projects were highly visible and grew in scope; however, it was quickly realized that digital libraryI still needed additional direction and coherence.  During the initial funding period of the digital libraryI PROTOTYPES, PROJECTS, AND INTERFACES        427 program, additional workshops were created to develop consensus on the directions and boundaries with discussions from various communities. An important aspect that many people realized from the workshops is the importance of efforts in domains outside computer and information science to the advances in digital libraries research [324]. A follow-on program, Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2 (digital libraryI-2), jointly supported by NSF, DARPA, NASA, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the Library of Congress (LoC), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and others, was announced in the spring of 1998 focus less on technology research than digital libraryI, but, more importantly, supporting research across the information life cycle, from content creation, access, and use to preservation and archiving, moving towards the concept of digital libraries as human-centered systems. digital libraryI-2 will emphasize the study of interactions between digital libraries and humans, fuller understanding of and improving access to digital content and collections, and interoperability and integration toward flexible information environments at the level of individual, group, and institution [324, 216]. The program will involve people not only from science and engineering but also from arts and humanities.
mir-0301	15.5.1    International Range of Efforts digital library efforts, accessible over the Internet, can now lead to worldwide access. Since each nation wishes to share the highlights of its history, culture, and accomplishments with the rest of the world, developing a digital library can be very helpful [86]. Indeed, we see many nations with active digital library programs [270], and there are many others underway or emerging. One of the largest efforts is the European ERCIM program [239], This is enhanced by the large eLib initiative in the UK [778]. There are good results from activities in New Zealand [601] and Australia [389]. In Singapore, billions are being invested in developing networked connectivity and digital libraries as part of educational innovation programs [729]. For information on other nations, see the online table pointing to various national projects associated with a recent special issue on this topic [270], As mentioned briefly above, many nations around the world have priceless antiquities that can be more widely appreciated through digital librarys [300]. Whether in pilot mode or as a commercial product, IBM Digital Library [390], with its emphasis on rights management, has been designed and used to help in this regard. These projects all require multimedia and multilingual support, as discussed earlier. Different scenarios of use are appropriate in different cultures, and different structures and spaces are needed for various types of collections. Indeed, many international collections aim for global coverage, but with other criteria defining their focus. Thus, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (Ndigital libraryTD) [594] is open to all universities, as well as other supporting organizations, with the aim of providing increased access to scholarly 428        DIGITAL LIBRARIES resources as a direct result of improving the skills and education of graduate students, who directly submit their works to the digital library.
mir-0302	15.5.2    Usability Key to the success of digital library projects is having usable systems. This is a serious challenge! Simple library catalog systems were observed in 1986 to be difficult to use [104], and still remain so after a further decade of research and development [105]. The above mentioned ENVISION project's title began with the expression 'User-Centered' and concentrated most of its resources on work with the interface [360]. A 1997 study at Virginia Tech of four digital library systems concluded that many have serious usability problems [434], though the design of the Illinois digital libraryI system seemed promising. The Virginia Tech study uncovered an important aspect of the situation, and suggested that it will be years before digital library systems are properly understood and used. A pre-test asked about user expectations for a digital library, and found that very few had worked with a digital library. The post-test showed that user expectations and priorities for various features changed dramatically over the short test period. Thus, it is likely that in general, as digital library usage spreads, there will be an increase in understanding, a shift in what capabilities users expect, and a variety of extensions to the interfaces now considered. Early in the digital libraryI work, digital library use was perceived as a research focus [98], and understanding and assessing user needs became a key concern [382]. For two years, a workshop was held at the Allerton conference center of the University of Illinois on this topic. Since the 1995 event [313] had a diverse group of researchers, it was necessary to understand the various perspectives and terminologies. There were discussions of fundamental issues, such as information, from a human factors perspective [214], as well as specific explorations of tasks like document browsing [528]. The 1996 event was more focused due to greater progress in building and studying usability of digital librarys [314]. Thus, there was discussion of Stanford's Sense-Maker system which supports rapid shifting between contexts that reflect stages of user exploration [51]. Social concerns that broaden the traditional IR perspective were highlighted [367]. In addition, there was movement towards metrics (see discussion earlier about digital library metrics) and factors for adopting digital librarys [429]. digital library interfaces and usability concerns have been central to many efforts at Xerox PARC. Some of the research considers social issues related to documents [354] while other research bridges the gap between paper and digital documents [353]. There are many issues about documents, especially their stability and how multimedia components as well as active elements affect retrieval, preservation, and other digital library activities [506]. Some insight into digital library use may result from actual user observation as well as other measures of what (parts of) documents are read [507]. There also has been collaboration between PARC and the UCB digital libraryI team, which has extended the Xerox magic filter work into multivalent documents (discussed earlier) as well as having developed results visualization methods like STANDARDS        429 TileBars where it is easy to spot the location of term matches in long documents [355]. Further work is clearly needed in digital library projects to improve the systems and their usability. But for these systems to work together, there also must be some emphasis on standards.
mir-0303	15.6    Standards Since there are many digital library projects worldwide, involving diverse research, development, and commercial approaches, it is imperative that standards are employed so as to make interoperability and data exchange possible. Since by tradition any library can buy any book, and any library patron can read anything in the library, digital librarys must make differences in representation transparent to their users. In online searching as well, data that can be understood by clients as well as other digital librarys should be what is transferred from each information source. At the heart of supporting federated digital librarys, especially, is agreement on protocols for computer-computer communication.
mir-0304	15.6.1    Protocols and Federation In the 1980s it became clear that as library catalog systems proliferated, and library patrons sought support for finding items not locally available through inter-library loan or remote cataloging search, some protocol was needed for searching remote bibliographic collections. The national standard Z39.50, which later became an international standard as well, led to intensive development of implementations and subsequent extensive utilization [515]. One example of widespread utilization was the WAIS system (based on Z39.50), very popular before the World Wide Web emerged. Ongoing development of Z39.50 has continued, including its application to digital librarys, as demonstrated in the CIMI project described earlier, where a number of different clients and server implementations all worked together. Also mentioned earlier is the NCSTRL effort, starting with CS technical reports, in which the Dienst protocol was developed [210]. This is a 'lighter' protocol than Z39.50, designed to support federated searching of digital librarys, but also connected to the centralized preprint service (CoRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Dienst seems suitable for electronic theses and dissertations as well as technical reports, and so it has been considered in regard to Ndigital libraryTD. These protocols assume that each server and client will be changed to use the protocol. A less intrusive approach, but one harder to implement and enforce, is to have some mechanism to translate from a special server or gateway system to/from each of the information sources of interest. The STARTS protocol [316] was proposed to move in this direction, but competition among search services on the Internet is so severe that acceptance seems unlikely.   Though 430        DIGITAL LIBRARIES this is unfortunate, simple federated schemes have been implemented in the digital libraryI projects at Stanford and Illinois, and a simple one is in use in Ndigital libraryTD. Yet, even more important than new protocols for digital library federated search is agreement on metadata schemes, which does seem feasible.
mir-0305	15.6.2    Metadata In the broadest sense, metadata can describe not only documents but also collections and whole digital librarys along with their services [50]. In a sense, this reflects movement toward holistic treatment like 5S. Yet in most digital library discussions, metadata just refers to a description of a digital object. This is precisely the role played by library catalog records. Hence, cataloging schemes like MARC are a starting point for many metadata descriptions [514]. While MARC has been widely used, it usually involves working with binary records which must be converted for interchange. One alternative is to encode MARC records using some readable coding scheme, like SGML [293]. Another concern with MARC is that there are a number of national versions with slight differences, as well as differences in cataloging practices that yield the MARC records. USMARC is one such version. It is very important in the digital library field, and can be encoded using SGML, or easily converted to simpler metadata schemes like the 'Dublin Core' [513]. Other 'crosswalks' exist between Dublin Core (DC), MARC, and schemes like GILS, proposed for a Government Information Locator Service [598]. A mapping also exists between DC and the Z39.50 protocol discussed in the previous section [503]. DC is a simple scheme, with 15 core elements that can be used to describe any digital object. What is of real import is that it has been widely accepted. That is because there have been years of discussion and development, focused around international workshops [806, 620, 560, 833, 333]. The core elements include seven that describe content (Title, Subject, Description, Source, Language, Relation, and Coverage). There are four elements that deal with intellectual property issues (Creator, Publisher, Contributor, and Rights). Finally, to deal with instances of abstract digital objects, there are four other types (Data, Type, Format, and Identifier). Since digital objects and their metadata often have to be interchanged across systems, the problem of packaging arises. The Warwick Framework, which evolved out of the same type of discussions leading to DC, deals with packages and connections between packages [472]. In general, such discussion about metadata is crucial to allow the move from traditional libraries (with their complex and expensive cataloging), past the Web (with its general lack of cataloging and metadata), to a reasonable environment wherein metadata is available for all sorts of digital objects (suitable to allow the organization of vast collections in digital librarys [734]). Because the Web has need of such organization, this has become an interest of its coordinating body, the WWW Consortium [84]. In 1996, as concern increased about protecting children from exposure to objectionable materials, TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES        431 metadata schemes became connected with censoring and filtering requirements. The problem was renamed for the more general case, in keeping with Harvest's treatment of 'resource discovery,' to 'resource description.' The Resource Description Framework (RDF) thus became an area of study for the Consortium [753]. It should be noted that RDF can lead to header information inside digital objects, including those coded in SGML or HTML, as well as XML (see Chapter 6 for more details). In the more general case, however, RDF is essentially a scheme for annotating digital objects, so alternatively the descriptions can be stored separately from those objects. These options bring us back to the Warwick Framework where there may be multiple containers, sometimes connected through indirection, of packages of metadata, like MARC or DC. We see that digital librarys can be complex collections with various structuring mechanisms for managing data and descriptions of that data, the so-called metadata. However, coding may combine data with metadata, as is specified in the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) [670]. This reminds us of the complexities that arise when combining streams and structures, where there are many equivalent representations. We also see that for digital library standards to be useful, such as appears to be the case for DC, the structures involved must be relatively simple, and have well understood related scenarios of use. While this now appears to work for data interchange, further work is required for interoperability, i.e., interchange through the streams involved in protocols.
mir-0306	15.7    Trends and Research Issues There are many remaining challenges in the digital library field. While TEI provides guidance in complex encoding situations, and has been advocated by the University of Michigan for electronic theses and dissertations, it is unclear how far the rest of the scholarly community will move towards the thorough markup and description of digital objects that characterize humanistic study [670]. Though such markup is valuable to support context-dependent queries as well as electronic document preservation, it will only be generally feasible when there are less expensive tools and more efficient methods for adding in such markup and description, which may occur as XML usage expands. Then, too, the IR community must provide guidance regarding automatic indexing of marked up documents, metadata, full-text, multimedia streams, and complex hypermedia networks so that the rich and varied content of digital librarys can be searched. On a grander scale are the problems of handling worldwide digital librarys, in the context of varying collection principles, enormous difference in response time between local and remote servers, and the needs of users for different views [474]. Thus, one type of scenario might deal with searching all dissertations worldwide, another might be concerned with finding recent results from a particular research group, a third might consider only freely available works in a particular specialty area, a fourth might deal with seeking the new works recently highly rated by a distributed group of close friends, and yet another might involve the most 432        DIGITAL LIBRARIES readable overviews in an unknown area. Other key research challenges have been highlighted in various workshops aimed at establishing an agenda for investigation [525]. Of central concern is covering the range from personal to global digital librarys, the so-called 'scaling' problem. At the same time, the problem of interoperability must be faced [624]. As argued earlier, we view the solution to these problems to be the acknowledgement of the role of 5S in the digital library arena and the focus of research and development on treating streams, structures, spaces, scenarios, and societies as first class objects and building blocks for digital librarys. We will continue to explore this approach in future work, and believe that, to the extent that integrated support for 5S is developed, real progress will be made towards the next generation of digital libraries.
mir-0307	15.8    Bibliographical Discussion As explained in section 15.1, there are many good sources of information about digital libraries. The best pair are the book by Lesk [501] and the online D-Lib Magazine [280]. Pointers to the latest information and sources can be found through online courseware [268]. New books will appear from MIT Press and other publishers. Large funding initiatives, programs, and projects (e.g., [216, 778, 349]) involving the US National Science Foundation (see e.g., the call for Digital Libraries Initiative - Phase 2, NSF 98-63, http://www.dli2.nsf.gov) and other sponsors, and becoming more and more international in nature (e.g., International Digital Libraries Collaborative, NSF 99-6, will lead to a continuing stream of reports on workshops (e.g., [266, 313, 314, 333, 833, 525]) and high quality research presentations at premiere events like the ACM Digital Libraries conferences (e.g. [50, 192, 382, 507, 548, 705, 791]). Acknowledgements The preparation of this chapter and work described therein was supported in part by US Department of Education grant P116B61190 and by NSF grants CDA-9303152, CDA-9308259, CDA-9312611, DUE-975219G, DUE-975240, and IRI-9116991.
mir-0308	Appendix Porter's Algorithm The rules in the Porter algorithm are separated into five distinct phases numbered from 1 to 5. They are applied to the words in the text starting from phase 1 and moving on to phase 5. Further, they are applied sequentially one after the other as commands in a program. Thus, in what follows, we specify the Porter algorithm in a pseudo programming language whose commands take the form of rules for suffix substitution (as above). This pseudo language adopts the following (semi-formal) conventions: ï  A consonant variable is represented by the symbol C which is used to refer to any letter other than a,e,i,o,u and other than the letter y preceded by a consonant. ï  A vowel variable is represented by the symbol V which is used to refer to any letter which is not a consonant. ï  A generic letter (consonant or vowel) is represented by the symbol L. ï  The symbol lt;jgt; is used to refer to an empty string (i.e., one with no letters). ï  Combinations of C, V", and L are used to define patterns. ï  The symbol * is used to refer to zero or more repetitions of a given pattern. ï  The symbol -f is used to refer to one or more repetitions of a given pattern. ï  Matched parentheses are used to subordinate a sequence of variables to the operators * and -f. ï  A generic pattern is a combination of symbols, matched parentheses, and the operators * and ~f. 433 434       PORTER'S ALGORITHM ï  The substitution rules are treated as commands which are separated by a semicolon punctuation mark. ï  The substitution rules are applied to the suffixes in the current word. ï  A conditional if statement is expressed as 'if (pattern) rule' and the rule is executed only if the pattern in the condition matches the current word. ï  A line which starts with a % is treated as a comment. ï  Curly brackets (braces) are used to form compound commands. ï  A 'select rule with longest suffix' statement selects a single rule for execution among all the rules in a compound command. The rule selected is the one with the largest matching suffix. Thus, the expression (C)* refers to a sequence of zero or more consonants while the expression ((V)*(C)*)* refers to a sequence of zero or more vowels followed by zero or more consonants which can appear zero or more times. It is important to distinguish the above from the sequence (V * C) which states that a sequence must be present and that this sequence necessarily starts with a vowel, followed by a subsequence of zero or more letters, and finished by a consonant. Finally, the command if (*y * L) then ed ógt; lt;/gt; states that the substitution of the suffix ed by nil (i.e., the removal of the suffix ed) only occurs if the current word contains a vowel and at least one additional letter. The Porter algorithm is applied to each word in the text (simple formulation) and is given by the following procedure. % Phase 1: Plurals and past participles. select rule with longest suffix { sses ógt; ss; ies ó? i; ss ó* ss; s ógt; lt;/gt;; } select rule with longest suffix { if ((Cn(V)+(C) + )+(VTeed) then eed ógt; ee; if (*V*ed or *V*ing) then { PORTER'S ALGORITHM        435 select rule with longest suffix { ed ógt;  ing ógt; 0; } select rule with longest suffix { at ógt; ate; bl ó? ble; iz ógt; ize; if ((*CiC2) and  (Ci   =   C2)  and (Ci 0 {l,s,z})) then CXC2 ógt; Ci; if   {({CY{{V)+(C)+)ClV1C2)   and (C2 £ {w,x,y})) then e; } if (*V*y) then y ógt; i; if((C)*((I/)+(C)+)+(I/)* select rule with longest suffix { ational ó? ate; tional ógt; tion; enci ógt; ence; anci ó? ance; izer ógt; ize; abli ó^ able; alii ógt; al; entli ógt; ent; eli ó? e; ousli ógt;ï ous; ization ógt; ize; ation ó? ate; at or ógt; ate; alism ó? al; iveness ó? ive; fulness óy fill: ousness ó-*- ous; aiiti ógt;- al; iviti ógt; ive; biliti ó? ble; } select rule with longest suffix { icate ó* ic; at ive -ó? dgt;; 436        PORTER'S ALGORITHM alize ó? al; iciti ógt; ic; ical ó? ic; ful ó* 4gt;ness ó? cp; } if ((C)*((V)+(C)+)((V)+(C)+)+(V)*) then select rule with longest suffix { al ógt; 0; ance ó? 0; ence ógt; 0; er ógt; 0; ic ógt; 4gt;; able ój- cp; ible ógt;¶ 0; ant ó?

1009024	Dependence language model for information retrieval This paper presents a new dependence language modeling approach to information retrieval. The approach extends the basic language modeling approach based on unigram by relaxing the independence assumption. We integrate the linkage of a query as a hidden variable, which expresses the term dependencies within the query as an acyclic, planar, undirected graph. We then assume that a query is generated from a document in two stages: the linkage is generated first, and then each term is generated in turn depending on other related terms according to the linkage. We also present a smoothing method for model parameter estimation and an approach to learning the linkage of a sentence in an unsupervised manner. The new approach is compared to the classical probabilistic retrieval model and the previously proposed language models with and without taking into account term dependencies. Results show that our model achieves substantial and significant improvements on TREC collections.
1009025	Parsimonious language models for information retrieval We systematically investigate a new approach to estimating the parameters of language models for information retrieval, called parsimonious language models. Parsimonious language models explicitly address the relation between levels of language models that are typically used for smoothing. As such, they need fewer (non-zero) parameters to describe the data. We apply parsimonious models at three stages of the retrieval process: 1) at indexing time; 2) at search time; 3) at feedback time. Experimental results show that we are able to build models that are significantly smaller than standard models, but that still perform at least as well as the standard approaches.
1009026	Cluster-based retrieval using language models Previous research on cluster-based retrieval has been inconclusive as to whether it does bring improved retrieval effectiveness over document-based retrieval. Recent developments in the language modeling approach to IR have motivated us to re-examine this problem within this new retrieval framework. We propose two new models for cluster-based retrieval and evaluate them on several TREC collections. We show that cluster-based retrieval can perform consistently across collections of realistic size, and significant improvements over document-based retrieval can be obtained in a fully automatic manner and without relevance information provided by human.
1009027	Corpus structure, language models, and ad hoc information retrieval Most previous work on the recently developed language-modeling approach to information retrieval focuses on document-specific characteristics, and therefore does not take into account the structure of the surrounding corpus. We propose a novel algorithmic framework in which information provided by document-based language models is enhanced by the incorporation of information drawn from clusters of similar documents. Using this framework, we develop a suite of new algorithms. Even the simplest typically outperforms the standard language-modeling approach in precision and recall, and our new interpolation algorithm posts statistically significant improvements for both metrics over all three corpora tested.
1009029	Document clustering by concept factorization In this paper, we propose a new data clustering method called concept factorization that models each concept as a linear combination of the data points, and each data point as a linear combination of the concepts. With this model, the data clustering task is accomplished by computing the two sets of linear coefficients, and this linear coefficients computation is carried out by finding the non-negative solution that minimizes the reconstruction error of the data points. The cluster label of each data point can be easily derived from the obtained linear coefficients. This method differs from the method of clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) citeXu03 in that it can be applied to data containing negative values and the method can be implemented in the kernel space. Our experimental results show that the proposed data clustering method and its variations performs best among 11 algorithms and their variations that we have evaluated on both TDT2 and Reuters-21578 corpus. In addition to its good performance, the new method also has the merit in its easy and reliable derivation of the clustering results.
1009030	Learning to cluster web search results Organizing Web search results into clusters facilitates users' quick browsing through search results. Traditional clustering techniques are inadequate since they don't generate clusters with highly readable names. In this paper, we reformalize the clustering problem as a salient phrase ranking problem. Given a query and the ranked list of documents (typically a list of titles and snippets) returned by a certain Web search engine, our method first extracts and ranks salient phrases as candidate cluster names, based on a regression model learned from human labeled training data. The documents are assigned to relevant salient phrases to form candidate clusters, and the final clusters are generated by merging these candidate clusters. Experimental results verify our method's feasibility and effectiveness.
1009031	Document clustering via adaptive subspace iteration Document clustering has long been an important problem in information retrieval. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm ASI 1 , which uses explicitly modeling of the subspace structure associated with each cluster. ASI simultaneously performs data reduction and subspace identification via an iterative alternating optimization procedure. Motivated from the optimization procedure, we then provide a novel method to determine the number of clusters. We also discuss the connections of ASI with various existential clustering approaches. Finally, extensive experimental results on real data sets show the effectiveness of ASI algorithm.
1009032	Restrictive clustering and metaclustering for self-organizing document collections This paper addresses the problem of automatically structuring heterogenous document collections by using clustering methods. In contrast to traditional clustering, we study restrictive methods and ensemble-based meta methods that may decide to leave out some documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate clusters with low confidence. These techniques result in higher cluster purity, better overall accuracy, and make unsupervised self-organization more robust. Our comprehensive experimental studies on three different real-world data collections demonstrate these benefits. The proposed methods seem particularly suitable for automatically substructuring personal email folders or personal Web directories that are populated by focused crawlers, and they can be combined with supervised classification techniques.
1009034	Feature selection using linear classifier weights: interaction with classification models This paper explores feature scoring and selection based on weights from linear classification models. It investigates how these methods combine with various learning models. Our comparative analysis includes three learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in combination with three feature weighting methods: Odds Ratio, Information Gain, and weights from linear models, the linear SVM and Perceptron. Experiments show that feature selection using weights from linear SVMs yields better classification performance than other feature weighting methods when combined with the three explored learning algorithms. The results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature weighting method rather than its apparent compatibility with the learning algorithm that improves classification performance.
1009035	Web-page classification through summarization Web-page classification is much more difficult than pure-text classification due to a large variety of noisy information embedded in Web pages. In this paper, we propose a new Web-page classification algorithm based on Web summarization for improving the accuracy. We first give empirical evidence that ideal Web-page summaries generated by human editors can indeed improve the performance of Web-page classification algorithms. We then propose a new Web summarization-based classification algorithm and evaluate it along with several other state-of-the-art text summarization algorithms on the LookSmart Web directory. Experimental results show that our proposed summarization-based classification algorithm achieves an approximately 8.8% improvement as compared to pure-text-based classification algorithm. We further introduce an ensemble classifier using the improved summarization algorithm and show that it achieves about 12.9% improvement over pure-text based methods.
1009036	Parameterized generation of labeled datasets for text categorization based on a hierarchical directory Although text categorization is a burgeoning area of IR research, readily available test collections in this field are surprisingly scarce. We describe a methodology and system (named ACCIO) for automatically acquiring labeled datasets for text categorization from the World Wide Web, by capitalizing on the body of knowledge encoded in the structure of existing hierarchical directories such as the Open Directory. We define parameters of categories that make it possible to acquire numerous datasets with desired properties , which in turn allow better control over categorization experiments. In particular, we develop metrics that estimate the difficulty of a dataset by examining the host directory structure. These metrics are shown to be good predictors of categorization accuracy that can be achieved on a dataset, and serve as efficient heuristics for generating datasets subject to user's requirements. A large collection of automatically generated datasets are made available for other researchers to use.
1009038	Information retrieval using word senses: root sense tagging approach Information retrieval using word senses is emerging as a good research challenge on semantic information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method using word senses in information retrieval: root sense tagging method. This method assigns coarse-grained word senses defined in WordNet to query terms and document terms by unsupervised way using co-occurrence information constructed automatically. Our sense tagger is crude, but performs consistent disambiguation by considering only the single most informative word as evidence to disambiguate the target word. We also allow multiple-sense assignment to alleviate the problem caused by incorrect disambiguation.Experimental results on a large-scale TREC collection show that our approach to improve retrieval effectiveness is successful, while most of the previous work failed to improve performances even on small text collection. Our method also shows promising results when is combined with pseudo relevance feedback and state-of-the-art retrieval function such as BM25.
1009039	An effective approach to document retrieval via utilizing WordNet and recognizing phrases Noun phrases in queries are identified and classified into four types: proper names, dictionary phrases, simple phrases and complex phrases. A document has a phrase if all content words in the phrase are within a window of a certain size. The window sizes for different types of phrases are different and are determined using a decision tree. Phrases are more important than individual terms. Consequently, documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority. We utilize WordNet to disambiguate word senses of query terms. Whenever the sense of a query term is determined, its synonyms, hyponyms, words from its definition and its compound words are considered for possible additions to the query. Experimental results show that our approach yields between 23% and 31% improvements over the best-known results on the TREC 9, 10 and 12 collections for short (title only) queries, without using Web data.
1009040	Web-a-where: geotagging web content We describe Web-a-Where, a system for associating geography with Web pages. Web-a-Where locates mentions of places and determines the place each name refers to. In addition, it assigns to each page a geographic focus --- a locality that the page discusses as a whole. The tagging process is simple and fast, aimed to be applied to large collections of Web pages and to facilitate a variety of location-based applications and data analyses.Geotagging involves arbitrating two types of ambiguities: geo/non-geo and geo/geo. A geo/non-geo ambiguity occurs when a place name also has a non-geographic meaning, such as a person name (e.g., Berlin) or a common word (Turkey). Geo/geo ambiguity arises when distinct places have the same name, as in London, England vs. London, Ontario.An implementation of the tagger within the framework of the WebFountain data mining system is described, and evaluated on several corpora of real Web pages. Precision of up to 82% on individual geotags is achieved. We also evaluate the relative contribution of various heuristics the tagger employs, and evaluate the focus-finding algorithm using a corpus pretagged with localities, showing that as many as 91% of the foci reported are correct up to the country level.
1009042	Focused named entity recognition using machine learning In this paper we study the problem of finding most topical named entities among all entities in a document, which we refer to as focused named entity recognition. We show that these focused named entities are useful for many natural language processing applications, such as document summarization, search result ranking, and entity detection and tracking. We propose a statistical model for focused named entity recognition by converting it into a classification problem. We then study the impact of various linguistic features and compare a number of classification algorithms. From experiments on an annotated Chinese news corpus, we demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve near human-level accuracy.
1009043	Learning phonetic similarity for matching named entity translations and mining new translations We propose a novel named entity matching model which considers both semantic and phonetic clues. The matching is formulated as an optimization problem. One major component is a phonetic matching model which exploits similarity at the phoneme level. We investigate three learning algorithms for obtaining the similarity information of basic phoneme units based on training examples. By applying this proposed named entity matching model, we also develop a mining framework for discovering new, unseen named entity translations from online daily Web news. This framework harvests comparable news in different languages using an existing bilingual dictionary. It is able to discover new name translations not found in the dictionary.
1009044	Text classification and named entities for new event detection New Event Detection is a challenging task that still offers scope for great improvement after years of effort. In this paper we show how performance on New Event Detection (NED) can be improved by the use of text classification techniques as well as by using named entities in a new way. We explore modifications to the document representation in a vector space-based NED system. We also show that addressing named entities preferentially is useful only in certain situations. A combination of all the above results in a multi-stage NED system that performs much better than baseline single-stage NED systems.
1009046	Assigning identifiers to documents to enhance the clustering property of fulltext indexes Web Search Engines provide a large-scale text document retrieval service by processing huge Inverted File indexes. Inverted File indexes allow fast query resolution and good memory utilization since their d -gaps representation can be effectively and efficiently compressed by using variable length encoding methods. This paper proposes and evaluates some algorithms aimed to find an assignment of the document identifiers which minimizes the average values of d -gaps, thus enhancing the effectiveness of traditional compression methods. We ran several tests over the Google contest collection in order to validate the techniques proposed. The experiments demonstrated the scalability and effectiveness of our algorithms. Using the proposed algorithms, we were able to sensibly improve (up to 20.81%) the compression ratios of several encoding schemes.
1009047	Filtering algorithms for information retrieval models with named attributes and proximity operators In the selective dissemination of information (or publish/subscribe) paradigm, clients subscribe to a server with continuous queries (or profiles) that express their information needs. Clients can also publish documents to servers. Whenever a document is published, the continuous queries satisfying this document are found and notifications are sent to appropriate clients. This paper deals with the filtering problem that needs to be solved effciently by each server: Given a database of continuous queries db and a document d , find all queries q ? db that match d . We present data structures and indexing algorithms that enable us to solve the filtering problem efficiently for large databases of queries expressed in the model AWP which is based on named attributes with values of type text, and word proximity operators.
1009048	Hourly analysis of a very large topically categorized web query log We review a query log of hundreds of millions of queries that constitute the total query traffic for an entire week of a general-purpose commercial web search service. Previously, query logs have been studied from a single, cumulative view. In contrast, our analysis shows changes in popularity and uniqueness of topically categorized queries across the hours of the day. We examine query traffic on an hourly basis by matching it against lists of queries that have been topically pre-categorized by human editors. This represents 13% of the query traffic. We show that query traffic from particular topical categories differs both from the query stream as a whole and from other categories. This analysis provides valuable insight for improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. It is also relevant to the development of enhanced query disambiguation, routing, and caching algorithms.
1009050	A collaborative filtering algorithm and evaluation metric that accurately model the user experience Collaborative Filtering (CF) systems have been researched for over a decade as a tool to deal with information overload. At the heart of these systems are the algorithms which generate the predictions and recommendations.In this article we empirically demonstrate that two of the most acclaimed CF recommendation algorithms have flaws that result in a dramatically unacceptable user experience.In response, we introduce a new Belief Distribution Algorithm that overcomes these flaws and provides substantially richer user modeling. The Belief Distribution Algorithm retains the qualities of nearest-neighbor algorithms which have performed well in the past, yet produces predictions of belief distributions across rating values rather than a point rating value.In addition, we illustrate how the exclusive use of the mean absolute error metric has concealed these flaws for so long, and we propose the use of a modified Precision metric for more accurately evaluating the user experience.
1009051	An automatic weighting scheme for collaborative filtering Collaborative filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users. The memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In these approaches, different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions. The impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration. For example, an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings. Even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem, empirical studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present an optimization algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users. More specifically, the new weighting scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting scheme substantially improves the performance of the Pearson correlation coefficient method for collaborative filtering.
1009052	Using bayesian priors to combine classifiers for adaptive filtering An adaptive information filtering system monitors a document stream to identify the documents that match information needs specified by user profiles. As the system filters, it also refines its knowledge about the user's information needs based on long-term observations of the document stream and periodic feedback(training data) from the user. Low variance profile learning algorithms, such as Rocchio, work well at the early stage of filtering when the system has very few training data. Low bias profile learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, work well at the later stage of filtering when the system has accumulated enough training data.However, an empirical system needs to works well consistently at all stages of filtering process. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a new technique to combine different text classification algorithms via a constrained maximum likelihood Bayesian prior. This technique provides a trade off between bias and variance, and the combined classifier may achieve a consistent good performance at different stages of filtering. We implemented the proposed technique to combine two complementary classification algorithms: Rocchio and logistic regression. The new algorithm is shown to compare favorably with Rocchio, Logistic Regression, and the best methods in the TREC-9 and TREC-11 adaptive filtering tracks.
1009053	A nonparametric hierarchical bayesian framework for information filtering Information filtering has made considerable progress in recent years. The predominant approaches are content-based methods and collaborative methods. Researchers have largely concentrated on either of the two approaches since a principled unifying framework is still lacking. This paper suggests that both approaches can be combined under a hierarchical Bayesian framework . Individual content-based user profiles are generated and collaboration between various user models is achieved via a common learned prior distribution. However, it turns out that a parametric distribution (e.g. Gaussian) is too restrictive to describe such a common learned prior distribution. We thus introduce a nonparametric common prior , which is a sample generated from a Dirichlet process which assumes the role of a hyper prior . We describe effective means to learn this nonparametric distribution, and apply it to learn users' information needs. The resultant algorithm is simple and understandable, and offers a principled solution to combine content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Within our framework, we are now able to interpret various existing techniques from a unifying point of view. Finally we demonstrate the empirical success of the proposed information filtering methods.
1009055	Automatic image annotation by using concept-sensitive salient objects for image content representation Multi-level annotation of images is a promising solution to enable more effective semantic image retrieval by using various keywords at different semantic levels. In this paper, we propose a multi-level approach to annotate the semantics of natural scenes by using both the dominant image components and the relevant semantic concepts. In contrast to the well-known image-based and region-based approaches, we use the salient objects as the dominant image components to achieve automatic image annotation at the content level. By using the salient objects for image content representation, a novel image classification technique is developed to achieve automatic image annotation at the concept level. To detect the salient objects automatically, a set of detection functions are learned from the labeled image regions by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with an automatic scheme for searching the optimal model parameters. To generate the semantic concepts, finite mixture models are used to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects. An adaptive EM algorithm has been proposed to determine the optimal model structure and model parameters simultaneously. We have also demonstrated that our algorithms are very effective to enable multi-level annotation of natural scenes in a large-scale dataset.
1009056	A search engine for historical manuscript images Many museum and library archives are digitizing their large collections of handwritten historical manuscripts to enable public access to them. These collections are only available in image formats and require expensive manual annotation work for access to them. Current handwriting recognizers have word error rates in excess of 50% and therefore cannot be used for such material. We describe two statistical models for retrieval in large collections of handwritten manuscripts given a text query. Both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint probability distribution between features computed from word images and their transcriptions. The models can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten documents given a text query. We show experiments with a training set of 100 transcribed pages and a test set of 987 handwritten page images from the George Washington collection. Experiments show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic retrieval system for historical manuscripts using text queries, without manual transcription of the original corpus.
1009057	Display time as implicit feedback: understanding task effects Recent research has had some success using the length of time a user displays a document in their web browser as implicit feedback for document preference. However, most studies have been confined to specific search domains, such as news, and have not considered the effects of task on display time, and the potential impact of this relationship on the effectiveness of display time as implicit feedback. We describe the results of an intensive naturalistic study of the online information-seeking behaviors of seven subjects during a fourteen-week period. Throughout the study, subjects' online information-seeking activities were monitored with various pieces of logging and evaluation software. Subjects were asked to identify the tasks with which they were working, classify the documents that they viewed according to these tasks, and evaluate the usefulness of the documents. Results of a user-centered analysis demonstrate no general, direct relationship between display time and usefulness, and that display times differ significantly according to specific task, and according to specific user.
1009058	Human versus machine in the topic distillation task This paper reports on and discusses a set of user experiments using the TREC 2003 Web interactive track protocol. The focus is on comparing humans and machine algorithms in terms of performance in a topic distillation task. We also investigated the effect of the search results layout in supporting the users' effort.We have demonstrated that machines can perform nearly as well as people on the topic distillation task. Given a system tailored to the task there is significant performance improvement and finally, given a presentation that supports the task, there is strong user satisfaction.
1009060	Learning effective ranking functions for newsgroup search Web communities are web virtual broadcasting spaces where people can freely discuss anything. While such communities function as discussion boards, they have even greater value as large repositories of archived information. In order to unlock the value of this resource, we need an effective means for searching archived discussion threads. Unfortunately the techniques that have proven successful for searching document collections and the Web are not ideally suited to the task of searching archived community discussions. In this paper, we explore the problem of creating an effective ranking function to predict the most relevant messages to queries in community search. We extract a set of predictive features from the thread trees of newsgroup messages as well as features of message authors and lexical distribution within a message thread. Our final results indicate that when using linear regression with this feature set, our search system achieved a 28.5% performance improvement compared to our baseline system.
1009061	Language-specific models in multilingual topic tracking Topic tracking is complicated when the stories in the stream occur in multiple languages. Typically, researchers have trained only English topic models because the training stories have been provided in English. In tracking, non-English test stories are then machine translated into English to compare them with the topic models. We propose a native language hypothesis stating that comparisons would be more effective in the original language of the story. We first test and support the hypothesis for story link detection. For topic tracking the hypothesis implies that it should be preferable to build separate language-specific topic models for each language in the stream. We compare different methods of incrementally building such native language topic models.
1009062	Web taxonomy integration through co-bootstrapping We address the problem of integrating objects from a source taxonomy into a master taxonomy. This problem is not only currently pervasive on the web, but also important to the emerging semantic web. A straightforward approach to automating this process would be to learn a classifier that can classify objects from the source taxonomy into categories of the master taxonomy. The key insight is that the availability of the source taxonomy data could be helpful to build better classifiers for the master taxonomy if their categorizations have some semantic overlap. In this paper, we propose a new approach, co-bootstrapping, to enhance the classification by exploiting such implicit knowledge. Our experiments with real-world web data show substantial improvements in the performance of taxonomy integration.
1009064	Evaluation of an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions This paper evaluates an extraction-based approach to answering definitional questions. Our system extracted useful linguistic constructs called linguistic features from raw text using information extraction tools and formulated answers based on such features. The features employed include appositives, copulas, structured patterns, relations, propositions and raw sentences. The features were ranked based on feature type and similarity to a question profile . Redundant features were detected using a simple heuristic-based strategy. The approach achieved state of the art performance at the TREC 2003 QA evaluation. Component analysis of the system was carried out using an automatic scoring function called Rouge (Lin and Hovy, 2003). Major findings include 1) answers using linguistic features are significantly better than those using raw sentences; 2) the most useful features are appositives and copulas; 3) question profiles, as a means of modeling user interests, can significantly improve system performance; 4) the Rouge scores are closely correlated with subjective evaluation results, indicating the suitability of using Rouge for evaluating definitional QA systems.
1009065	Query based event extraction along a timeline In this paper, we present a framework and a system that extracts events relevant to a query from a collection C of documents, and places such events along a timeline. Each event is represented by a sentence extracted from C, based on the assumption that "important" events are widely cited in many documents for a period of time within which these events are of interest. In our experiments, we used queries that are event types ("earthquake") and person names (e.g. "George Bush"). Evaluation was performed using G8 leader names as queries: comparison made by human evaluators between manually and system generated timelines showed that although manually generated timelines are on average more preferable, system generated timelines are sometimes judged to be better than manually constructed ones.
1009066	Sentence completion We discuss a retrieval model in which the task is to complete a sentence, given an initial fragment, and given an application specific document collection. This model is motivated by administrative and call center environments, in which users have to write documents with a certain repetitiveness. We formulate the problem setting and discuss appropriate performance metrics. We present an index-based retrieval algorithm and a cluster-based approach, and evaluate our algorithms using collections of emails that have been written by two distinct service centers.
1009068	Block-level link analysis Link Analysis has shown great potential in improving the performance of web search. PageRank and HITS are two of the most popular algorithms. Most of the existing link analysis algorithms treat a web page as a single node in the web graph. However, in most cases, a web page contains multiple semantics and hence the web page might not be considered as the atomic node. In this paper, the web page is partitioned into blocks using the vision-based page segmentation algorithm. By extracting the page-to-block, block-to-page relationships from link structure and page layout analysis, we can construct a semantic graph over the WWW such that each node exactly represents a single semantic topic. This graph can better describe the semantic structure of the web. Based on block-level link analysis, we proposed two new algorithms, Block Level PageRank and Block Level HITS, whose performances we study extensively using web data.
1009069	Usefulness of hyperlink structure for query-biased topic distillation In this paper, we introduce an information theoretic method for estimating the usefulness of the hyperlink structure induced from the set of retrieved documents. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method in the context of an optimal Bayesian decision mechanism, which selects the most appropriate retrieval approaches on a per-query basis for two TREC tasks. The estimation of the hyperlink structure's usefulness is stable when we use different weighting schemes, or when we employ sampling of documents to reduce the computational overhead. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of the hyperlink structure's usefulness in a realistic setting, by setting the thresholds of a decision mechanism automatically. Our results show that improvements over the baselines are obtained.
1009070	Block-based web search Multiple-topic and varying-length of web pages are two negative factors significantly affecting the performance of web search. In this paper, we explore the use of page segmentation algorithms to partition web pages into blocks and investigate how to take advantage of block-level evidence to improve retrieval performance in the web context. Because of the special characteristics of web pages, different page segmentation method will have different impact on web search performance. We compare four types of methods, including fixed-length page segmentation, DOM-based page segmentation, vision-based page segmentation, and a combined method which integrates both semantic and fixed-length properties. Experiments on block-level query expansion and retrieval are performed. Among the four approaches, the combined method achieves the best performance for web search. Our experimental results also show that such a semantic partitioning of web pages effectively deals with the problem of multiple drifting topics and mixed lengths, and thus has great potential to boost up the performance of current web search engines.
1009072	A hybrid statistical/linguistic model for generating news story gists In this paper, we describe a News Story Gisting system that generates a 10-word short summary of a news story. This system uses a machine learning technique to combine linguistic, statistical and positional information in order to generate an appropriate summary. We also present the results of an automatic evaluation of this system with respect to the performance of other baseline summarisers using the new ROUGE evaluation metric.
1009073	Image based gisting in CLIR In this paper, we describe research which could lead to a novel approach to gathering an overview of a document in a foreign language. The research explores how much of the meaning of a document could be represented using images by researching the ability of subjects to derive the search term that might have been used to return a set of images from an image library. The Google image search engine was used to retrieve the images for this experiment, which uses English throughout. The results were analysed with respect to a previous paper [1] exploring ability to recognise concrete objects in hierarchies. It was found that there is a tendency to use one particular level of categorization.
1009074	Classifying racist texts using a support vector machine In this poster we present an overview of the techniques we used to develop and evaluate a text categorisation system to automatically classify racist texts. Detecting racism is difficult because the presence of indicator words is insufficient to indicate racist texts, unlike some other text classification tasks. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to automatically categorise web pages based on whether or not they are racist. Different interpretations of what constitutes a term are taken, and in this poster we look at three representations of a web page within an SVM -- bag-of-words, bigrams and part-of-speech tags.
1009075	Discovery of aggregate usage profiles based on clustering information needs We present an alternative technique for discovering aggregate usage profiles from Web access logs. The technique is based on clustering information needs inferred from users' browsing paths. Browsing paths are extracted from users' access logs. Information need is inferred from each browsing path by using the Ostensive Model[1]. The technique is evaluated in a document recommendation application. We compare the performance of our technique against the well-established transaction-based technique proposed in [2]. Based on an initial evaluation, the results are encouraging.

1009077	The effect of back-formulating questions in question answering evaluation An abstract is not available.
1009078	Effect of varying number of documents in blind feedback: analysis of the 2003 NRRC RIA workshop bf_numdocs experiment suite An abstract is not available.
1009079	Eye-tracking analysis of user behavior in WWW search We investigate how users interact with the results page of a WWW search engine using eye-tracking. The goal is to gain insight into how users browse the presented abstracts and how they select links for further exploration. Such understanding is valuable for improved interface design, as well as for more accurate interpretations of implicit feedback (e.g. clickthrough) for machine learning. The following presents initial results, focusing on the amount of time spent viewing the presented abstracts, the total number of abstract viewed, as well as measures of how thoroughly searchers evaluate their results set.
1009080	Subwebs for specialized search We describe a method to define and use subwebs, user-defined neighborhoods of the Internet. Subwebs help improve search performance by inducing a topic-specific page relevance bias over a collection of documents. Subwebs may be automatically identified using a simple algorithm we describe, and used to provide highly-relevant topic-specific information retrieval. Using subwebs in a Help and Support topic, we see marked improvements in precision compared to generic search engine results.
1009081	Comparison of using passages and documents for blind relevance feedback in information retrieval This paper compares document blind feedback and passage blind feedback in Information Retrieval (IR), based on the work during the NRRC 2003 Reliable Information Access Summer workshop. The analysis of our experimental results shows overall consistency on the performance impact of using passages and documents for blind feedback. However, it is observed that the behavior of passage blind feedback, compared to document blind feedback, is both system dependent and topic dependent. The relationships between the performance impact of passage blind feedback and the number of feedback terms and the topic's average relevant document length, respectively, are examined to illustrate these dependencies.
1009082	Measuring pseudo relevance feedback & CLIR In this poster, we report on the effects of pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) for a cross language image retrieval task using a test collection. Typically PRF has been shown to improve retrieval performance in previous CLIR experiments based on average precision at a fixed rank. However our experiments have shown that queries in which no relevant documents are returned also increases. Because query reformulation for cross language is likely to be harder than with monolingual searching, a great deal of user dissatisfaction would be associated with this scenario. We propose that an additional effectiveness measure based on failed queries may better reflect user satisfaction than average precision alone.
1009083	A two-stage mixture model for pseudo feedback Pseudo feedback is a commonly used technique to improve information retrieval performance. It assumes a few top-ranked documents to be relevant, and learns from them to improve the retrieval accuracy. A serious problem is that the performance is often very sensitive to the number of pseudo feedback documents. In this poster, we address this problem in a language modeling framework. We propose a novel two-stage mixture model, which is less sensitive to the number of pseudo feedback documents than an effective existing feedback model. The new model can tolerate a more flexible setting of the number of pseudo feedback documents without the danger of losing much retrieval accuracy.
1009084	Natural language processing for browse help In this paper, we will present three "browsing" systems that should save user's time. The first uses named entities and gives a way to reduce search space. By using a information visualization system, the user can comprehend more easily the content of a corpus or a document. Named entities are highlighted for quick reading, temporal and geographic representation gives a global view of the result of a query. All these browse and search helps seem to be very useful. Nevertheless, an evaluation would give more practical results.
1009085	Triangulation without translation Transitive retrieval and triangulation have been proposed as ways to improve cross-language retrieval quality when translation resources have poor lexical coverage. We demonstrate that cross-language retrieval is viable for European languages with no translation resources at all; that transitive retrieval without translation does not suffer the drop-off in retrieval quality sometimes reported for transitive retrieval with translation; and that triangulation that combines multiple transitive runs with no translation can boost performance over direct translation-free retrieval.
1009086	A session-based search engine In this poster, we describe a novel session-based search engine, which puts the search in context. The search engine has a number of session-based features including expansion of the current query with user query history and clickthrough data (title and summary of clicked web pages) in the same search session and the session boundary recognition through temporal closeness and probabilistic similarity between query terms. In addition, the search engine visualizes the rank change of web pages as different queries are submitted in the same search session to help the user reformulate the query.
1009087	Evaluation of filtering current news search results We describe an evaluation of result set filtering techniques for providing ultra-high precision in the task of presenting related news for general web queries. In this task, the negative user experience generated by retrieving non-relevant documents has a much worse impact than not retrieving relevant ones. We adapt cost-based metrics from the document filtering domain to this result filtering problem in order to explicitly examine the tradeoff between missing relevant documents and retrieving non-relevant ones. A large manual evaluation of three simple threshold filters shows that the basic approach of counting matching title terms outperforms also incorporating selected abstract terms based on part-of-speech or higher-level linguistic structures. Simultaneously, leveraging these cost-based metrics allows us to explicitly determine what other tasks would benefit from these alternative techniques.
1009088	The document as an ergodic markov chain In recent years, statistical language models are being proposed as alternative to the vector space model. Viewing documents as language samples introduces the issue of defining a joint probability distribution over the terms.The present paper models a document as the result of a Markov process. It argues that this process is ergodic, which is theoretically plausible, and easy to verify in practice.The theoretical result is that the joint distribution can be easily obtained. This can also be applied for search resolutions other than the document level. We verified this in an experiment on query expansion demonstrating both the validity and the practicability of the method. This holds a promise for general language models.
1009089	Expertise community detection Providing knowledge workers with access to experts and communities-of-practice is central to sharing expertise and crucial to organizational performance, adaptation, and even survival. This paper covers ongoing research to develop an Expert Locator prototype, a model-based system for detecting experts and broader communities-of-practice. The underlying expertise model is extensible and supports aggregation of evidence across diverse sources. The prototype is being used to locate critical expertise in key project areas, and current evaluation indicates its potential effectiveness.
1009090	Learning patterns to answer open domain questions on the web While being successful in providing keyword based access to web pages, commercial search portals still lack the ability to answer questions expressed in a natural language. We present a probabilistic approach to automated question answering on the Web, based on trainable patterns, answer triangulation and semantic filtering. In contrast to the other "shallow" approaches, our approach is entirely self-learning. It does not require any manually created scoring and filtering rules while still performing comparably. It also performs better than other fully trainable approaches.
1009091	Email is a stage: discovering people roles from email archives An abstract is not available.
1009092	Searching databases for sematically-related schemas In this paper, we address the problem of searching schema databases for semantically-related schemas. We first give a method of finding semantic similarity between pair-wise schemas based on tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, word expansion, and ontology matching. We then address the problem of indexing the schema database through a semantic hash table. Matching schemas in the database are found by hashing the query attributes and recording peaks in the histogram of schema hits. Results indicated a 90% improvement in search performance while maintaining high precision and recall.
1009093	Topic prediction based on comparative retrieval rankings A new measure, AnchorMap, is introduced to evaluate how close two document retrieval rankings are to each other. It is shown that AnchorMap scores, when run on a set of initial ranked document lists from 8 different systems, are very highly correlated with categorization of topics as easy or hard, and separately, are highly correlated with those topics on which blind feedback works. In another experiment, AnchorMap is used to compare the initial ranked document list from a single system against the ranked document list from that system after blind feedback. Again, high AnchorMap values are highly correlated with both topic difficulty and successful application of blind feedback. Both experiments are examples of using properties of a topic which are independent of relevance information to predict the actual performance of IR systems on the topic. Initial experiments to attempt to improve retrieval performance based upon AnchorMap failed; the causes for failure are discussed.
1009094	Context-based question-answering evaluation In this poster, we will present the results of efforts we have undertaken to conduct evaluations of a QA system in a real world environment and to understand the nature of the dimensions on which users evaluate QA systems when given full reign to comment on whatever dimensions they deem important.
1009095	Design of an e-book user interface and visualizations to support reading for comprehension Current e-Book browsers provide minimal support for comprehending the organization, narrative structure, and themes, of large complex books. In order to build an understanding of such books, readers should be provided with user interfaces that present, and relate, the organizational, narrative and thematic structures. We propose adapting information retrieval techniques for the purpose of discovering these structures, and sketch three distinctive visualizations for presenting these structures to the e-Book reader. These visualizations are presented within an initial design for an e-Book browser.
1009096	Toward better weighting of anchors Okapi BM25 scoring of anchor text surrogate documents has been shown to facilitate effective ranking in navigational search tasks over web data. We hypothesize that even better ranking can be achieved in certain important cases, particularly when anchor scores must be fused with content scores, by avoiding length normalisation and by reducing the attentuation of scores associated with high tf . Preliminary results are presented.
1009097	Aggregated feature retrieval for MPEG-7 via clustering In this paper, we describe an approach to combining text and visual features from MPEG-7 descriptions of video. A video retrieval process is aligned to a text retrieval process based on the TF*IDF vector space model via clustering of low-level visual features. Our assumption is that shots within the same cluster are not only similar visually but also semantically, to a certain extent. Our experiments on the TRECVID2002 and TRECVID2003 collections show that adding extra meaning to a shot based on the shots from the same cluster is useful when each video in a collection contains a high proportion of similar shots, for example in documentaries.
1009098	Answer models for question answering passage retrieval Answer patterns have been shown to improve the perfor-mance of open-domain factoid QA systems. Their use, however, requires either constructing the patterns manually or developing algorithms for learning them automatically. We present here a simpler approach that extends the techniques of language modeling to create answer models. These are language models trained on the correct answers to training questions. We show how they fit naturally into a probabilis-tic model for answer passage retrieval and demonstrate their effectiveness on the TREC 2002 QA Corpus.
1009099	Collaborative filing in a document repository We introduce an emergent, collaborative filing system. In such a system, an individual is allowed to organize a subset of documents in a repository into a personal hierarchy and share the hierarchy with others. The system generates a "consensus" hierarchy from all users' personal hierarchies, which provides a full, common, and emergent view of all documents. We believe that collaborative filing helps translate personal, tacit knowledge into sharable structures, which help the user as well a community of which he or she is a part. Our filing system is suitable for any documents from text to multimedia files. Initial results on an experimental website show promise. For a knowledge task involving extensive document retrieval, hierarchies are not only used frequently but are also effective in identifying high quality documents. One surprising finding is how often subjects use others' personal hierarchies, and upon close examination, social networks play a key role as well.
1009100	A study of topic similarity measures In this poster we describe an investigation of topic similarity measures. We elicit assessments on the similarity of 10 pairs of topic from 76 subjects and use these as a benchmark to assess how well each measure performs. The measures have the potential to form the basis of a predictive technique, for adaptive search systems. The results of our evaluation show that measures based on the level of correlation between topics concords most with general subject perceptions of search topic similarity.
1009101	Effectiveness of web page classification on finding list answers List question answering (QA) offers a unique challenge in effectively and efficiently locating a complete set of distinct answers from huge corpora or the Web. In TREC-12, the median average F 1 performance of list QA systems was only 6.9%. This paper exploits the wealth of freely available text and link structures on the Web to seek complete answers to list questions. We employ natural language parsing, web page classification and clustering to find reliable list answers. We also study the effectiveness of web page classification on both the recall and uniqueness of answers for web-based list QA.
1009102	Detection and translation of OOV terms prior to query time Accurate cross-language information retrieval requires that query terms be correctly translated. Several new techniques to improve the translation of out of vocabulary terms in English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval have been developed. However, these require queries and a document collection to enable translation disambiguation. Although effective, they involve much processing and searching of the Web at query time, and may not be practical in a production web search engine. In this work, we consider what tasks maybe carried out beforehand, the goal being to reduce the processing required at query time. We have successfully developed new techniques to extract and translate out of vocabulary terms using the Web and add them into a translation dictionary prior to query time.
1009103	Evaluation of the real and perceived value of automatic and interactive query expansion The paper describes a user study examining methods for improving users queries, specifically interactive and automatic query expansion and advanced search options. The user study includes subjective and objective evaluation of the effect of the above methods and a comparison between the real and perceived effect.

1009105	On evaluating web search with very few relevant documents Many common web searches by their nature have a very small number of relevant documents. Homepage and "namedpage" searching are known-item searches where there is only a single relevant document. Topic distillation is a special kind of topical relevance search where the user wishes to find a few key web sites rather than every relevant web page. Because these types of searches are so common, web search evaluations have come to focus on tasks where there are very few relevant documents. Evaluations with few relevant documents pose special challenges for current metrics. In particular, the TREC 2003 topic distillation evaluation is unable to distinguish most submitted runs from each other.
1009106	A music recommender based on audio features Many collaborative music recommender systems ( CMRS ) have succeeded in capturing the similarity among users or items based on ratings, however they have rarely considered about the available information from the multimedia such as genres, let alone audio features from the media stream. Such information is valuable and can be used to solve several problems in RS. In this paper, we design a CMRS based on audio features of the multimedia stream. In the CMRS , we provide recommendation service by our proposed method where a clustering technique is used to integrate the audio features of music into the collaborative filtering ( CF ) framework in hopes of achieving better performance. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate that our approach is feasible.
1009107	Information extraction using two-phase pattern discovery This paper presents a new two-phase pattern (2PP) discovery technique for information extraction. 2PP consists of orthographic pattern discovery (OPD) and semantic pattern discovery (SPD) where the OPD determines the structural features from an identified region of a document and the SPD discovers a dominant semantic pattern for the region via inference, apposition and analogy. Then the discovered pattern is applied back into the region to extract required data items through pattern matching. We evaluated 2PP using 6500 data items and obtained effective result.
1009108	A search engine for imaged documents in PDF files Large quantities of documents in the Internet and digital libraries are simply scanned and archived in image format, many of which are packed in PDF files. The word search tool provided by Adobe Reader/Acrobat does not work for these imaged documents. In this paper, we present a search engine to deal with this issue for imaged documents in PDF files. The experimental results show an encouraging performance.
1009109	Context sensitive vocabulary and its application in protein secondary structure prediction Protein secondary structure prediction is an important step towards understanding the relation between protein sequence and structure. However, most current prediction methods use features difficult for biologists to interpret. In this paper, we present a new method that applies information retrieval techniques to solve the problem:we extract a context sensitive biological vocabulary for protein sequences and apply text classification methods to predict protein secondary structure. Experimental results show that our method performs comparably to the state-of-art methods. Furthermore, the context sensitive vocabularies can serve as a useful tool to discover meaningful regular expression patterns for protein structures.

1009111	User biased document language modelling Capitalizing on the intuitive underlying assumptions of Language Modelling for Ad-Hoc Retrieval we present a novel approach that is capable of injecting the user's context of the document collection into the retrieval process. The preliminary findings from the evaluation undertaken suggest that improved IR performance is possible under certain circumstances. This motivates further investigation to determine the extent and significance of this improved performance.

1009113	A unified model of literal mining and link analysis for ranking web resources Web link analysis has been proved to provide significant enhancement to the precision of Web search in practice. The PageRank algorithm, which is used in Google Search Engine, plays an important role on improving the quality of its resuls by employing the explicit hyperlink structure among the Web pages. The prestige of Web pages defined by PageRank is purely derived from surfer random walk on the Web graph without textual content content consideration. However, in the practical sense, user surfing behavior is far from random jumping. In this paper, we present a unified model for a more accurate page rank. User's surfing is guided by a probabilistic model that is based on literal matching between connected pages. The result shows that our proposed ranking algorithms do perform better than the original PageRank.

1009115	A joint framework for collaborative and content filtering This paper proposes a novel, unified, and systematic approach to combine collaborative and content-based filtering for ranking and user preference prediction. The framework incorporates all available information by coupling together multiple learning problems and using a suitable kernel or similarity function between user-item pairs. We propose and evaluate an on-line algorithm (JRank)that generalizes perceptron learning using this framework and shows significant improvement over other approaches.
1009116	Refining term weights of documents using term dependencies When processing raw documents in Information Retrieval (IR) System, a term-weighting scheme is used to calculate the importance of each term which occurs in a document. However, most term-weighting schemes assume that a term is independent of the other terms. Term dependency is an indispensable consequence of language use [1]. Therefore, this assumption can make the information of a document being lost. In this paper, we propose new approach to refine term weights of documents using term dependencies discovered from a set of documents. Then, we evaluate our method with two experiments based on the vector space model [2] and the language model [3].
1009117	Multiple sources of evidence for XML retrieval Document-centric XML collections contain text-rich documents, marked up with XML tags. The tags add lightweight semantics to the text. Querying such collections calls for a hybrid query language: the text-rich nature of the documents suggest a content-oriented (IR) approach, while the mark-up allows users to add structural constraints to their IR queries. We will show how evidence for relevancy from different sources helps to answer such hybrid queries. We evaluate our methods using the INEX 2003 test set, and show that structural hints in hybrid queries help to improve retrieval effectiveness.
1009118	Verifying a Chinese collection for text categorization This article describes the development of a free test collection for Chinese text categorization. A novel retrieval-based approach was developed to detect duplicates and label inconsistency in this corpus and in Reuters-21578 for comparison. The method was able to detect certain types of similar and/or duplicated documents that were overlooked by an alternative repetition-based method [1]. Experiments showed that effectiveness was not affected by the confusing documents.
1009119	Query-related data extraction of hidden web documents The larger amount of information on the Web is stored in document databases and is not indexed by general-purpose search engines (i.e., Google and Yahoo). Such information is dynamically generated through querying databases - which are referred to as Hidden Web databases. Documents returned in response to a user query are typically presented using template-generated Web pages. This paper proposes a novel approach that identifies Web page templates by analysing the textual contents and the adjacent tag structures of a document in order to extract query-related data. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach effectively detects templates and retrieves data with high recall and precision.
1009120	The patent retrieval task in the fourth NTCIR workshop This paper describes the Patent Retrieval Task in the Fourth NTCIR Workshop, and the test collections produced in this task. We perform the invalidity search task, in which each participant group searches a patent collection for the patents that can invalidate the demand in an existing claim. We also perform the automatic patent map generation task, in which the patents associated with a specific topic are organized in a multi-dimensional matrix.
1009121	Measuring ineffectiveness An evaluation methodology that targets ineffective topics is needed to support research on obtaining more consistent retrieval across topics. Using average values of traditional evaluation measures is not an appropriate methodology because it emphasizes effective topics: poorly performing topics' scores are by definition small, and they are therefore difficult to distinguish from the noise inherent in retrieval evaluation. We examine two new measures that emphasize a system's worst topics. While these measures focus on different aspects of retrieval behavior than traditional measures, the measures are less stable than traditional measures and the margin of error associated with the new measures is large relative to the observed differences in scores.
1009122	Information retrieval using hierarchical dirichlet processes An information retrieval method is proposed using a hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a set of multinomial distributions. The resulting method naturally includes a number of features found in other popular methods. Specifically, tf.idf-like term weighting and document length normalisation are recovered. The new method is compared with Okapi BM-25 [3] and the Twenty-One model [1] on TREC data and is shown to give better performance.
1009123	Broken plural detection for arabic information retrieval Due to the high number of inflectional variations of Arabic words, empirical results suggest that stemming is essential for Arabic information retrieval. However, current light stemming algorithms do not extract the correct stem of irregular (so-called broken) plurals, which constitute ~10% of Arabic texts and ~41% of plurals. Although light stemming in particular has led to improvements in information retrieval [5, 6], the effects of broken plurals on the performance of information retrieval systems has not been examined.We propose a light stemmer that incorporates a broken plural recognition component, and evaluate it within the context of information retrieval. Our results show that identifying broken plurals and reducing them to their correct stems does result in a significant improvement in the performance of information retrieval systems.
1009124	A study of methods for normalizing user ratings in collaborative filtering The goal of collaborative filtering is to make recommendations for a test user by utilizing the rating information of users who share interests similar to the test user. Because ratings are determined not only by user interests but also the rating habits of users, it is important to normalize ratings of different users to the same scale. In this paper, we compare two different normalization strategies for user ratings, namely the Gaussian normalization method and the decoupling normalization method. Particularly, we incorporated these two rating normalization methods into two collaborative filtering algorithms, and evaluated their effectiveness on the EachMovie dataset. The experiment results have shown that the decoupling method for rating normalization is more effective than the Gaussian normalization method in improving the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms.
1009125	A review of relevance feedback experiments at the 2003 reliable information access (RIA) workshop. We review here the results of one of the experiments performed at the 2003 Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop, hosted by Mitre Corporation and the Northeast Regional Research Center (NRRC). The experiment concentrates on query expansion using relevance feedback and explores the behaviour of several information retrieval systems using variable numbers of relevant documents.
1009126	Supporting federated information sharing communities In this paper we describe the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), and associated architecture, which provide a way for organisations, distributed workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the World Wide Web. To support communities, we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within a community and the relationships between them. Within the FISC framework, we provide viewpoint retrieval to enable a user to construct visual contextual views of the community from the perspective of any community member. To evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity matching, and we develop prototypes to explore the broader architecture and usage issues.

1009129	Context-based methods for text categorisation We propose several context-based methods for text categorization. One method, a small modification to the PPM compression-based model which is known to significantly degrade compression performance, counter-intuitively has the opposite effect on categorization performance. Another method, called C-measure, simply counts the presence of higher order character contexts, and outperforms all other approaches investigated.

1009131	Constructing a text corpus for inexact duplicate detection As online document collections continue to expand, both on the Web and in proprietary environments, the need for duplicate detection becomes more critical. The goal of this work is to facilitate (a) investigations into the phenomenon of near duplicates and (b) algorithmic approaches to minimizing its negative effect on search results. Harnessing the expertise of both client-users and professional searchers, we establish principled methods to generate a test collection for identifying and handling inexact duplicate documents.
1009132	Why current IR engines fail Observations from a unique investigation of failure analysis of Information Retrieval (IR) research engines are presented. The Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop invited seven leading IR research groups to supply both their systems and their experts to an effort to analyze why their systems fail on some topics and whether the failures are due to system flaws, approach flaws, or the topic itself. There were surprising results from this cross-system failure analysis. One is that despite systems retrieving very different documents, the major cause of failure for any particular topic was almost always the same across all systems. Another is that relationships between aspects of a topic are not especially important for state-of-the-art systems; the systems are failing at a much more basic level where the top-retrieved documents are not reflecting some aspect at all.
1009133	Automatic sense disambiguation for acronyms A machine learning methodology for the disambiguation of acronym senses is presented, which starts from an acronym sense dictionary. Training data is automatically extracted from downloaded documents identified from the results of search engine queries. Leave-one-out cross-validation on 9,963 documents with 47 acronym forms achieves accuracy 92.58% and F ß=1 =91.52%.

1008993	Challenges in using lifetime personal information stores Within five years, our personal computers with terabyte disk drives will be able to store everything we read, write, hear, and many of the images we see including video. Vannevar Bush outlined such a system in his famous 1945 Memex article [1]. For the last four years we have worked on MyLifeBits www.MyLifeBits.com http://www.MyLifeBits.com, a system to digitally store everything from one's life, including books, articles, personal financial records, memorabilia, email, written correspondence, photos(time, location taken), telephone calls, video, television programs, and web pages visited. We recently added content from personal devices that automatically record photos and audio.The project started with the capture of Bell's content [2], followed by an effort to explore the use of the SQL database for storage and retrieval. Work has continued along these lines to extend content capture from every useful source e.g. a meeting capture system. The second phase of the project includes the design of tools and links for annotation, collections, cluster analysis, facets for characterizing the content, creation of timelines and stories, and other inherent database related capabilities, e.g. the ability to pivot on an event or photo or person to retrieve linked information [3]. Ideally we would like to have a system that would read every document, extract meta-data(e.g. Dublin Core) and classify it using multiple ontologies, faceted classifications, or the relevant.While such a system has implications for future computing devices and their users, these systems will only exist if we can effectively utilize the vast personal stores. Although our system is exploratory, the Stuff I've Seen system [4] demonstrates the utility and necessity of easy search and access to one's own data. Other research efforts with similar goals relating to personal information include Haystack [5], LifeStreams [6], and the UK "Memories for Life" Grand Challenge.There are serious research issues beyond the problem of making the information useful through rapid and easy retrieval.The "Dear Appy" problem ("Dear Appy, My application, or platform, or media left me unreadable. Signed, Lost Data") is unsettling to archivists and computer professionals -and must be solved.Just navigating the stored life of individual would at first glance appear to take almost a lifetime to sift through. While we are making progress in the capture of less traditionally archived content(e.g. meetings, phone calls & video), automatic interpretation and index of voice are illusive. MyLifeBits is currently focused on retrieval including the hopefully automatic , addition of meta-data e.g. document type identification, high level knowledge. While such data is essential for the archivist, it is unclear how useful such meta-data is to a one's own information; without such higher level knowledge and concepts, the vast amount of raw bits may be completely unusable.The most cited problem of personal archives is the control of the content including personal security, together with joint ownership of content by other individuals and organizations. In many corporations, periodic expunging of documents is the standard. Similarly, the aspects of a person's life not available in public documents is owned by the organization and all documents may have to be tagged in such a way that it can be expunged, if necessary, when an individual is no longer part of the organization. The HPPA law in the US and even more stringent privacy laws in other counties have major implications for personal stores.
1008994	Chemoinformatics: an application domain for information retrieval techniques Chemoinformatics is the generic name for the techniques used to represent, store and process information about the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures of chemical molecules [1, 2]. Chemoinformatics has attracted much recent prominence as a result of developments in the methods that are used to synthesize new molecules and then to test them for biological activity. These developments have resulted in a massive increase in the amounts of structural and biological information that is available to support discovery programmes in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.Chemoinformatics may appear to be far removed from information retrieval (IR), and there are indeed many significant differences, most notably in the use of graph representations to encode chemical molecules, rather than the strings that are used to encode text; however, there are also many similarities between the two fields, and this paper will exemplify some of these relationships. The most obvious area of similarity is in the principal types of database search that are carried out, with both application domains making extensive use of exact match, partial match and best match searching procedures: in the IR context these are known-item searching, Boolean searching and ranked-output searching; in the chemical context, these are structure searching, substructure searching and similarity searching. In IR, there is a natural distinction between an initial ranked-output search and one in which relevance feedback can be employed, where the keywords in the query statement are assigned weights based on their differential occurrences in known-relevant and known-nonrelevant documents. In the chemoinformatics technique called substructural analysis, substructural fragments are assigned weights based on their occurrence in molecules that do possess, and molecules that do not possess, some desired biological activity [3]. The analogy between relevance and biological activity has also resulted in the development of measures to quantify the effectiveness of chemical searching procedures that are based on the standard IR concepts of recall and precision [4].Analogies such as these have provided the basis for some of the chemoinformatics research carried out in Sheffield. The starting point was the recognition that techniques applicable to documents represented by keywords might also be applicable to molecules represented by substructural fragments. This led directly to the introduction of similarity searching, something that is now a standard tool in chemoinformatics software systems; in particular, its use for virtual screening, i.e., the ranking of a database in order of decreasing probability of activity so as to maximize the cost-effectiveness of biological testing [5]. Measures of inter-molecular structural similarity also lie at the heart of systems for clustering chemical databases: just as IR has the Cluster Hypothesis (similar documents tend to be relevant to the same requests) as a basis for document clustering, so the Similar Property Principle (similar molecules tend to have similar properties) has led to clustering becoming a well-established tool for the organization of large chemical databases [6]. More recently, we have applied another IR technique, the use of data fusion to combine different rankings of a database, to chemoinformatics and again found that it is equally applicable in this new domain [7].The many similarities between IR and chemoinformatics that have already been identified suggest that chemoinformatics is a domain of which IR researchers should be aware when considering the applicability of new techniques that they have developed.
1008996	Evaluating high accuracy retrieval techniques Although information retrieval research has always been concerned with improving the effectiveness of search, in some applications, such as information analysis, a more specific requirement exists for high accuracy retrieval. This means that achieving high precision in the top document ranks is paramount. In this paper we present work aimed at achieving high accuracy in ad-hoc document retrieval by incorporating approaches from question answering(QA). We focus on getting the first relevant result as high as possible in the ranked list and argue that traditional precision and recall are not appropriate measures for evaluatin this task. We instead use the mean reciprocal rank(MRR) of the first relevant result. We evaluate three different methods for modifying queries to achieve high accuracy. The experiments done on TREC data provide support for the approach of using MRR and incorporating QA techniques for getting high accuracy in ad-hoc retrieval task.
1008997	Scaling IR-system evaluation using term relevance sets This paper describes an evaluation method based on Term Relevance Sets Trels that measures an IR system's quality by examining the content of the retrieved results rather than by looking for pre-specified relevant pages. Trels consist of a list of terms believed to be relevant for a particular query as well as a list of irrelevant terms. The proposed method does not involve any document relevance judgments, and as such is not adversely affected by changes to the underlying collection. Therefore, it can better scale to very large, dynamic collections such as the Web. Moreover, this method can evaluate a system's effectiveness on an updatable "live" collection, or on collections derived from different data sources. Our experiments show that the proposed method is very highly correlated with official TREC measures.
1008998	Using temporal profiles of queries for precision prediction A key missing component in information retrieval systems is self-diagnostic tests to establish whether the system can provide reasonable results for a given query on a document collection. If we can measure properties of a retrieved set of documents which allow us to predict average precision, we can automate the decision of whether to elicit relevance feedback, or modify the retrieval system in other ways. We use meta-data attached to documents in the form of time stamps to measure the distribution of documents retrieved in response to a query, over the time domain, to create a temporal profile for a query. We define some useful features over this temporal profile. We find that using these temporal features, together with the content of the documents retrieved, we can improve the prediction of average precision for a query.
1009000	Retrieval evaluation with incomplete information This paper examines whether the Cranfield evaluation methodology is robust to gross violations of the completeness assumption (i.e., the assumption that all relevant documents within a test collection have been identified and are present in the collection). We show that current evaluation measures are not robust to substantially incomplete relevance judgments. A new measure is introduced that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. This finding suggests that substantially larger or dynamic test collections built using current pooling practices should be viable laboratory tools, despite the fact that the relevance information will be incomplete and imperfect.
1009001	Forming test collections with no system pooling Forming test collection relevance judgments from the pooled output of multiple retrieval systems has become the standard process for creating resources such as the TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR test collections. This paper presents a series of experiments examining three different ways of building test collections where no system pooling is used. First, a collection formation technique combining manual feedback and multiple systems is adapted to work with a single retrieval system. Second, an existing method based on pooling the output of multiple manual searches is re-examined: testing a wider range of searchers and retrieval systems than has been examined before. Third, a new approach is explored where the ranked output of a single automatic search on a single retrieval system is assessed for relevance: no pooling whatsoever. Using established techniques for evaluating the quality of relevance judgments, in all three cases, test collections are formed that are as good as TREC.
1009002	Building an information retrieval test collection for spontaneous conversational speech Test collections model use cases in ways that facilitate evaluation of information retrieval systems. This paper describes the use of search-guided relevance assessment to create a test collection for retrieval of spontaneous conversational speech. Approximately 10,000 thematically coherent segments were manually identified in 625 hours of oral history interviews with 246 individuals. Automatic speech recognition results, manually prepared summaries, controlled vocabulary indexing, and name authority control are available for every segment. Those features were leveraged by a team of four relevance assessors to identify topically relevant segments for 28 topics developed from actual user requests. Search-guided assessment yielded sufficient inter-annotator agreement to support formative evaluation during system development. Baseline results for ranked retrieval are presented to illustrate use of the collection.
1009004	A formal study of information retrieval heuristics Empirical studies of information retrieval methods show that good retrieval performance is closely related to the use of various retrieval heuristics, such as TF-IDF weighting. One basic research question is thus what exactly are these "necessary" heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval performance. In this paper, we present a formal study of retrieval heuristics. We formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval function should satisfy, and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions. We find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally. Empirical results show that when a constraint is not satisfied, it often indicates non-optimality of the method, and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter values, its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range. In general, we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints. Thus the proposed constraints provide a good explanation of many empirical observations and make it possible to evaluate any existing or new retrieval formula analytically .
1009005	Probabilistic model for contextual retrieval Contextual retrieval is a critical technique for facilitating many important applications such as mobile search, personalized search, PC troubleshooting, etc. Despite of its importance, there is no comprehensive retrieval model to describe the contextual retrieval process. We observed that incompatible context, noisy context and incomplete query are several important issues commonly existing in contextual retrieval applications. However, these issues have not been previously explored and discussed. In this paper, we propose probabilistic models to address these problems. Our study clearly shows that query log is the key to build effective contextual retrieval models. We also conduct a case study in the PC troubleshooting domain to testify the performance of the proposed models and experimental results show that the models can achieve very good retrieval precision.
1009006	Discriminative models for information retrieval Discriminative models have been preferred over generative models in many machine learning problems in the recent past owing to some of their attractive theoretical properties. In this paper, we explore the applicability of discriminative classifiers for IR. We have compared the performance of two popular discriminative models, namely the maximum entropy model and support vector machines with that of language modeling, the state-of-the-art generative model for IR. Our experiments on ad-hoc retrieval indicate that although maximum entropy is significantly worse than language models, support vector machines are on par with language models. We argue that the main reason to prefer SVMs over language models is their ability to learn arbitrary features automatically as demonstrated by our experiments on the home-page finding task of TREC-10.
1009008	The overlap problem in content-oriented XML retrieval evaluation Within the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval(INEX) a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of content-oriented XML retrieval approaches were developed. Although these metrics provide a solution towards addressing the problem of overlapping result elements, they do not consider the problem of overlapping reference components within the recall-base, thus leading to skewed effectiveness scores. We propose alternative metrics that aim to provide a solution to both overlap issues.
1009009	Length normalization in XML retrieval XML retrieval is a departure from standard document retrieval in which each individual XML element, ranging from italicized words or phrases to full blown articles, is a potentially retrievable unit. The distribution of XML element lengths is unlike what we usually observe in standard document collections, prompting us to revisit the issue of document length normalization. We perform a comparative analysis of arbitrary elements versus relevant elements, and show the importance of length as a parameter for XML retrieval. Within the language modeling framework, we investigate a range of techniques that deal with length either directly or indirectly. We observe a length bias introduced by the amount of smoothing, and show the importance of extreme length priors for XML retrieval. We also show that simply removing shorter elements from the index (by introducing a cut-off value) does not create an appropriate document length normalization. Even after increasing the minimal size of XML elements occurring in the index, the importance of an extreme length bias remains.
1009010	Configurable indexing and ranking for XML information retrieval Indexing and ranking are two key factors for efficient and effective XML information retrieval. Inappropriate indexing may result in false negatives and false positives, and improper ranking may lead to low precisions. In this paper, we propose a configurable XML information retrieval system, in which users can configure appropriate index types for XML tags and text contents. Based on users' index configurations, the system transforms XML structures into a compact tree representation, Ctree, and indexes XML text contents. To support XML ranking, we propose the concepts of "weighted term frequency" and "inverted element frequency," where the weight of a term depends on its frequency and location within an XML element as well as its popularity among similar elements in an XML dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experiments on the INEX 03 dataset and 30 content and structure (CAS) topics. The experimental results reveal that our system has significantly high precision at low recall regions and achieves the highest average precision (0.3309) as compared with 38 official INEX 03 submissions using the strict evaluation metric.
1009012	Locality preserving indexing for document representation Document representation and indexing is a key problem for document analysis and processing, such as clustering, classification and retrieval. Conventionally, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is considered effective in deriving such an indexing. LSI essentially detects the most representative features for document representation rather than the most discriminative features. Therefore, LSI might not be optimal in discriminating documents with different semantics. In this paper, a novel algorithm called Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) is proposed for document indexing. Each document is represented by a vector with low dimensionality. In contrast to LSI which discovers the global structure of the document space, LPI discovers the local structure and obtains a compact document representation subspace that best detects the essential semantic structure. We compare the proposed LPI approach with LSI on two standard databases. Experimental results show that LPI provides better representation in the sense of semantic structure.
1009013	Polynomial filtering in latent semantic indexing for information retrieval Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a well established and effective framework for conceptual information retrieval. In traditional implementations of LSI the semantic structure of the collection is projected into the k -dimensional space derived from a rank- k approximation of the original term-by-document matrix. This paper discusses a new way to implement the LSI methodology, based on polynomial filtering. The new framework does not rely on any matrix decomposition and therefore its computational cost and storage requirements are low relative to traditional implementations of LSI. Additionally, it can be used as an effective information filtering technique when updating LSI models based on user feedback.
1009014	On scaling latent semantic indexing for large peer-to-peer systems The exponential growth of data demands scalable infrastructures capable of indexing and searching rich content such as text, music, and images. A promising direction is to combine information re-trieval with peer-to-peer technology for scalability, fault-tolerance, and low administration cost. One pioneering work along this di-rection is pSearch [32, 33]. pSearch places documents onto a peer-to- peer overlay network according to semantic vectors produced using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The search cost for a query is reduced since documents related to the query are likely to be co-located on a small number of nodes. Unfortunately, because of its reliance on LSI, pSearch also inherits the limitations of LSI. (1) When the corpus is large and heterogeneous, LSI's retrieval quality is inferior to methods such as Okapi. (2) The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) used in LSI is unscalable in terms of both memory consumption and computation time.This paper addresses the above limitations of LSI and makes the following contributions. (1) To reduce the cost of SVD, we reduce the size of its input matrix through document clustering and term selection. Our method retains the retrieval quality of LSI but is several orders of magnitude more efficient. (2) Through extensive experimentation, we found that proper normalization of semantic vectors for terms and documents improves recall by 76%. (3) To further improve retrieval quality, we use low-dimensional subvectors of semantic vectors to cluster documents in the overlay and then use Okapi to guide the search and document selection.
1009016	GaP: a factor model for discrete data We present a probabilistic model for a document corpus that combines many of the desirable features of previous models. The model is called "GaP" for Gamma-Poisson, the distributions of the first and last random variable. GaP is a factor model, that is it gives an approximate factorization of the document-term matrix into a product of matrices ? and X . These factors have strictly non-negative terms. GaP is a generative probabilistic model that assigns finite probabilities to documents in a corpus. It can be computed with an efficient and simple EM recurrence. For a suitable choice of parameters, the GaP factorization maximizes independence between the factors. So it can be used as an independent-component algorithm adapted to document data. The form of the GaP model is empirically as well as analytically motivated. It gives very accurate results as a probabilistic model (measured via perplexity) and as a retrieval model. The GaP model projects documents and terms into a low-dimensional space of "themes," and models texts as "passages" of terms on the same theme.
1009017	Belief revision for adaptive information retrieval Applying Belief Revision logic to model adaptive information retrieval is appealing since it provides a rigorous theoretical foundation to model partiality and uncertainty inherent in any information retrieval (IR) processes. In particular, a retrieval context can be formalised as a belief set and the formalised context is used to disambiguate vague user queries. Belief revision logic also provides a robust computational mechanism to revise an IR system's beliefs about the users' changing information needs. In addition, information flow is proposed as a text mining method to automatically acquire the initial IR contexts. The advantage of a belief-based IRsystem is that its IR behaviour is more predictable and explanatory. However, computational efficiency is often a concern when the belief revision formalisms are applied to large real-life applications. This paper describes our belief-based adaptive IR system which is underpinned by an efficient belief revision mechanism. Our initial experiments show that the belief-based symbolic IR model is more effective than a classical quantitative IR model. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful empirical evaluation of a logic-based IR model based on large IR benchmark collections.
1009018	Tuning before feedback: combining ranking discovery and blind feedback for robust retrieval Both ranking functions and user queries are very important factors affecting a search engine's performance. Prior research has looked at how to improve ad-hoc retrieval performance for existing queries while tuning the ranking function, or modify and expand user queries using a fixed ranking scheme using blind feedback. However, almost no research has looked at how to combine ranking function tuning and blind feedback together to improve ad-hoc retrieval performance. In this paper, we look at the performance improvement for ad-hoc retrieval from a more integrated point of view by combining the merits of both techniques. In particular, we argue that the ranking function should be tuned first, using user-provided queries, before applying the blind feedback technique. The intuition is that highly-tuned ranking offers more high quality documents at the top of the hit list, thus offers a stronger baseline for blind feedback. We verify this integrated model in a large scale heterogeneous collection and the experimental results show that combining ranking function tuning and blind feedback can improve search performance by almost 30% over the baseline Okapi system.
1009020	Translating unknown queries with web corpora for cross-language information retrieval It is crucial for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems to deal with the translation of unknown queries due to that real queries might be short. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the Web as the corpus source to translate unknown queries for CLIR. We propose an online translation approach to determine effective translations for unknown query terms via mining of bilingual search-result pages obtained from Web search engines. This approach can alleviate the problem of the lack of large bilingual corpora, translate many unknown query terms, provide flexible query specifications, and extract semantically-close translations to benefit CLIR tasks -- especially for cross-language Web search.
1009021	Resource selection for domain-specific cross-lingual IR An under-explored question in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is to what degree the performance of CLIR methods depends on the availability of high-quality translation resources for particular domains. To address this issue, we evaluate several competitive CLIR methods - with different training corpora - on test documents in the medical domain. Our results show severe performance degradation when using a general-purpose training corpus or a commercial machine translation system (SYSTRAN), versus a domain-specific training corpus. A related unexplored question is whether we can improve CLIR performance by systematically analyzing training resources and optimally matching them to target collections. We start exploring this problem by suggesting a simple criterion for automatically matching training resources to target corpora. By using cosine similarity between training and target corpora as resource weights we obtained an average of 5.6% improvement over using all resources with no weights. The same metric yields 99.4% of the performance obtained when an oracle chooses the optimal resource every time.
1009022	Using the web for automated translation extraction in cross-language information retrieval There have been significant advances in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) in recent years. One of the major remaining reasons that CLIR does not perform as well as monolingual retrieval is the presence of out of vocabulary (OOV) terms. Previous work has either relied on manual intervention or has only been partially successful in solving this problem. We use a method that extends earlier work in this area by augmenting this with statistical analysis, and corpus-based translation disambiguation to dynamically discover translations of OOV terms. The method can be applied to both Chinese-English and English-Chinese CLIR, correctly extracting translations of OOV terms from the Web automatically, and thus is a significant improvement on earlier work.
1009135	Evaluating content-based filters for image and video retrieval This paper investigates the level of metadata accuracy required for image filters to be valuable to users. Access to large digital image and video collections is hampered by ambiguous and incomplete metadata attributed to imagery. Though improvements are constantly made in the automatic derivation of semantic feature concepts such as indoor, outdoor, face, and cityscape, it is unclear how good these improvements should be and under what circumstances they are effective. This paper explores the relationship between metadata accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval using an amateur photo collection, documentary video, and news video. The accuracy of the feature classification is varied from performance typical of automated classifications today to ideal performance taken from manually generated truth data. Results establish an accuracy threshold at which semantic features can be useful, and empirically quantify the collection size when filtering first shows its effectiveness.
1009136	Semantic video classification by integrating unlabeled samples for classifier training Semantic video classification has become an active research topic to enable more effective video retrieval and knowledge discovery from large-scale video databases. However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of hand-labeled samples to learn correctly. To address this problem, we have proposed a semi-supervised framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, this emi-supervised framework includes: (a) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (b) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integrate the unlabeled samples to achieve parameter estimation and model selection simultaneously; The experimental results in a certain domain of medical videos are also provided.
1009137	Implicit queries (IQ) for contextualized search The Implicit Query (IQ) prototype is a system which automatically generates context-sensitive searches based on a user's current computing activities. In the demo, we show IQ running when users are reading or composing email. Queries are automatically generated by analyzing the email message, and results are presented in a small pane adjacent to the current window to provide peripheral awareness of related information.
1009138	An implicit system for predicting interests We demonstrate an adaptive search system that works proactively to help searchers find relevant information. The system observes searcher interaction, uses what it sees to model information needs and chooses additional query terms. The system watches for changes in the topic of the search and selects retrieval strategies that reflect the extent to which the topic is seen to change.
1009139	Geotemporal querying of multilingual documents This demonstration utilizes a geographic information system interface to display multilingual news documents in time and space by extracting place names from text and matching them to a multilingual multi-script gazetteer which identifies the latitude and longitude of the location.

1009145	Improving document representation by accumulating relevance feedback (abstract only): the relevance feedback accumulation algorithm This paper presents a document representation improvement technique named the Relevance Feedback Accumulation (RFA) algorithm. Using prior relevance feedback assessments and a data mining measure called support this algorithm improves document representations and generates higher quality indexes. At the same time, the algorithm is efficient and scalable, suited for retrieval systems managing large document collections. The results of the preliminary evaluation reveal that the RFA algorithm is able to reduce the index dimensionality while improving retrieval effectiveness.
1009146	Supporting federated information sharing communities (abstract only) Increasingly, the World Wide Web is being viewed as a means of creating web communities rather than simply as a means of publishing and delivering documents and services. In this research we develop the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), and associated architecture, that enables community-centred information systems to be constructed. Such systems provide a way for organisations, distributed workgroups and individuals to build up a federated community based on their common interests over the World Wide Web. To support communities, we develop capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within a community and the relationships between them: who is working on what topic, and who is working with whom. Within the FISC framework, we provide a viewpoint retrieval service to enable a user to construct visual contextual views of the community from the perspective of any community member. To evaluate these ideas we develop test beds to compare individual component technologies such as user and group profile construction and similarity matching, and we develop prototypes (Web Network and "CiteSeer Community") to explore the broader architecture and usage issues.
1009147	Toponym resolution in text (abstract only): which sheffield is it? Named entity tagging comprises the sub-tasks of identifying a text span and classifying it, but this view ignores the relationship between the entities and the world. Spatial and temporal entities ground events in space-time, and this relationship is vital for applications such as question answering and event tracking. There is much recent work regarding the temporal dimension (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2002, Mani and Wilson 2000), but no detailed study of the spatial dimension.I propose to investigate how spatial named entities (which are often referentially ambiguous) can be automatically resolved with respect to an extensional coordinate model (toponym resolution). To this end, various information sources including linguistic cue patterns, co-occurrence information, discourse/positional information, world knowledge (such as size and population) as well as minimality heuristics (Leidner et al. 2003) will be combined in a supervised machine learning regime.The major contributions of this research project will be a corpus of text manually annotated for spatial named entities with their model correlates as a training and evaluation resource, a novel method to spatially ground toponyms in text and a component-based evaluation based on this new reference corpus.
1009148	Sharing knowledge online (abstract only): a dream or reality? The Web provides a global platform for knowledge sharing. However, several shortcomings still arise from the absence of personalization and collaboration in Web searches. More effective retrieval techniques could be provided by means of transforming explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge. The approach presented in this paper is based on a peer-to-peer architecture and aims at complementing classical Web searches in terms of personalized ranking lists. These local rankings can be accumulated and evaluated in order to supplement the process of knowledge generation by building Virtual Knowledge Communities. Furthermore, the aggregation of ranking lists can be used to identify topics as well as communities of interest. Together with social aspects for community support, a framework for congenial Web search is defined.
1009149	Reliability and verification of natural language text on the world wide web (abstract only) The hypothesis that information on the Web can be verified automatically, with minimal user interaction, will be tested by building and evaluating an interactive system. In this paper, verification is defined as a reasonable determination of the truth or correctness of a statement by examination, research, or comparison with similar text. The system will contain modules for reliability ranking, query processing, document retrieval, and document clustering based on agreement. The query processing and document retrieval components will use standard IR techniques. The reliability module will estimate the likelihood that a statement on the Web can be trusted using standards developed by information scientists, as well as linguistic aspects of the page and the link structure of associated web pages. The clustering module will cluster relevant documents based on whether or not they agree or disagree with the statement to be verified. Relevant references are discussed.
1009150	An artificial intelligence approach to information retrieval (abstract only) Current approaches to information retrieval rely on the creativity of individuals to develop new algorithms. In this investigation the use of genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP) to learn IR algorithms is examined.Document structure weighting is a technique whereby different parts of a document (title, abstract, etc.) contribute unevenly to the overall document weight during ranking. Near optimal weights can be learned with a GA. Doing so shows a statistically significant 5% relative improvement in MAP for vector space inner product and Croft's probabilistic ranking, but no improvement for BM25. Two applications of this approach are suggested: offline learning, and relevance feedback.In a second set of experiments, a new ranking function was learned using GP. This new function yields a statistically significant 11% relative improvement on unseen queries tested on the training documents. Portability tests to different collections (not used in training) demonstrate the performance of the new function exceeds vector space and probability, and slightly exceeds BM25. Learning weights for this new function is proposed.The application of genetic learning to stemming and thesaurus construction is discussed. Stemming rules such as those of the Porter algorithm are candidates for GP learning whereas synonym sets are candidates for GA learning.
1009151	Understanding combination of evidence using generative probabilistic models for information retrieval (abstract only) Structured documents, rich information needs, and detailed information about users are becoming more pervasive within everyday computing usage. Applications such as Question Answering, reading tutors, and XML retrieval demand more robust retrieval on richly annotated documents. In order to effectively serve these applications, the community will need a better understanding of the combination of evidence. In this work, I propose that the use of simple generative probabilistic models will be an effective framework for these problems. Statistical language models, which are a special case of generative probabilistic models, have been used extensively within recent Information Retrieval research. Their flexibility has been very effective in adapting to numerous tasks and problems. I propose to extend the statistical language modeling framework to handle rich information needs and documents with structural and linguistic annotations. Much of the prior work on combination of evidence has had few well-studied theoretical contributions, so I also propose to develop a sounder theoretical basis which gives more predictable results.
1009152	Discovering and representing the contextual and narrative structure of e-books to support reading and comprehension (abstract only) A person reading a book needs to build an understanding based on the available textual materials. As a result of a survey of users' reading behaviours and of existing e-Book user interfaces, we found that most of these interfaces provide poor support for the actual processes of reading and comprehension. In particular, there is generally minimal support for understanding the overall structure (or contextual structure) and the narrative structure of a book. We propose adapting topic tracking and detection techniques to discover the narrative threads within a book, and hence its narrative structure. The contextual and narrative structures will be presented to the user through purpose-designed visualisations, which will be integrated and linked within a newly developed e-Book browser. We have chosen to use the Bible as our test corpus, as it has a rich narrative structure, and relatively complex contextual structure. Evaluation of the interface, and its components, will be done through field studies involving actual readers of the Bible, to assess the effectiveness of the user interface in enhancing a user's experience.
1009153	Supporting multiple information-seeking strategies in a single system framework (abstract only) This research explores the relationship between information-seeking strategies (ISSs) and information retrieval (IR) system design. When people seek information they engage in a variety of ISSs in order to search for specific items, learn about the contents of the database, evaluate retrieved information, and so on.The theoretical foundations of the work are based on the information-seeking episode model developed by Belkin (1996), and the multi-facet classification scheme of information behaviors proposed by Cool & Belkin (2002).The goal of this research is to construct and evaluate an interactive retrieval system which uses different combinations of IR techniques to support different ISSs. Example IR techniques include comparison using exact and probabilistic matching algorithms; summarization of information objects using titles, snippets or abstracts; visualization techniques such as lists or classified results; and navigation techniques such as scrolling or following links. By designing a retrieval system with diverse strategies in mind, we can adaptively support multiple ISSs, permitting a user to move seamlessly from one strategy to another, choosing instantiations of each support technique tailored to the specific ISS.The research will be conducted in a series of four steps. (1) Develop an object-oriented framework for representing basic IR techniques. (2) Design, implement and evaluate systems which support individual ISSs such as browsing and searching. (3) Specify an interaction structure for guiding and controlling sequences of different supporting techniques.(4) Design, implement, and evaluate a dynamically adaptive system supporting multiple ISSs in comparison to a non-adaptive baseline system.
1076035	The Portinari project: IR helps art and culture In May 30, 1983, The New York Times published the article "Brazil Gathers Archive On Its Painter, Portinari". The author, Warren Hoge, narrates: "/The late Candido Portinari is considered here to be the greatest artist Brazil has ever produced, yet all but a few of his 4,000 paintings are out of public view. They have become dispersed in private collections in so many places that his biographer compared their fate to that of Brazil's 18th-century revolutionary hero Tiradentes, whose body was dismembered and strewn along a 300-mile turnpike. The inaccessibility of Portinari's work is particularly vexing to his enthusiasts because his own dedication to producing an epic view of Brazil for his countrymen was such that he continued painting even after doctors warned that exposure to paint was killing him. He died of lead poisoning at the age of 58. Now, in a pioneering effort for Latin America, a team of experts in Rio is busy assembling the far-flung pieces of Portinari's obra into an exhaustive computerized archive. "/We are trying to rescue what is authentically ours'/, said João Candido Portinari, the painter's 44-year-old son, who is the coordinator of the group of researchers who make their headquarters on the leafy campus of Rio's Pontifical Catholic University. A telecommunications engineer with a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chairman of the university's mathematics department, Mr. Portinari has brought exacting technical standards to the task. Now four years into the project, the 14-member team has compiled photographic, technical. This presentation aims at describing the 26-year effort undertaken by the Portinari Project to locate, document, and record all prints, drawings and paintings created by the Brazilian artist Candido Portinari (1903-1962), as well as all documents. It is important to highlite the role of science and technology in this endeavour. It was fascinating to watch, over the years, how much, as the Portinari Project evolved, the advances of science and technology, and especially those related to IR, were able to address important challenges encountered in its development. In this presentation, a few examples of this process shall be described, such as the problem of identifying false paintings, the digital preservation of color images, the building of a complex multimedia knowledge database, etc. We also present the social work of art education developed in making all this material available /in loco/ to a wide audience in Brazil and abroad, including school children, especially children from poverty-stricken families. This social inclusion action stems from the fact that Portinari was deeply concerned to devoting his life, as an artist and also as a political person, to social and human values. In his speech /Art in the United Nations/ at the .Palais des Nations., Geneve, Switzerland, Von Lauestein Massarani observed that. */Portinari bequeathed to his native Brazil paintings of great poetical intensity. He grew up on the vast coffee plantations of Brodosqui in the state of Sao Paulo and it is this social setting which provided the inspiration for his work. All its human, cultural and religious aspects, captured by Portinari.s brush, reveal him as a .chronicler. of the concerns of twentieth-century Brazil. A rich plastic quality and variety of expressions are qualitites which give singular appeal to this deeply inspired work. His paintings are the successful achievement of his objective throughout his life: to arouse a feeling of the dignity of man, of fraternity and community spirit/*. *From these concerns, faithfully reflected in Portinari.s artistic legacy, we have been able to build an exceedingly powerful tool for developing a social acton that has already involved more than 500,000 children for all over Brazil, as shall be demonstrated in our talk. And finally we present one of the most important results of the project: "Candido Portinari - Catalogue /Raisonné/", published in September 2004, in 5 volumes, containing 4,991 works, with all their images and their technical, bibliographic and historical data. An example of the complexity of this undertaking is the work involved in /dating/ Portinari's oeuvre. Half of the works were undated and, /for each/ of these 2,500 works, it was necessary to cross it with 30,000 documents, to search if in a letter (6,000), in a periodical clipping (12,000), in a historical photograph (1,200), in an oral history recording (74 interviewed, 130-hour total recordings), etc., one could find information that would eventually lead to the date the work was created. The Portinari Project web site (http://www.portinari.org.br) presents all 4,991 paintings, drawing and prints, and all 30,000 entering a word contained in the work's description. The Catalogue /Raisonnß/ also comprises a detailed chrono-biography of the artist's life and times, compiled from the 30,000 documents that form the Portinari Project archives. To complete this 26-year task, the team visited almost all Brazilian states and more than 20 countries in the three Americas, Europe and the Middle Orient.
1076036	The future of media, blogs and innovation: new IR challenges? An axiom of every good investor is not to buy shares when the goodness of them is already into newspapers. Before, the information was circulating in some form, for example from mouth-to-mouth, closed circles, or newsletters. Nowadays the news can also occur in blogs that point to public or private communities that discuss topics that traditional media do not carry or even hide. Nowadays, standard communication media are trapped in a Cartesian or Platonic correspondence assumption. They want to tell us how things really are, how they have occurred, and how they will happen, disregarding a concrete world of problems where opportunities and threats live in real time for people. Searching and exploring the world of blogs can create an acceleration of innovation and a dissolution of the previous status quo. Here, the search unit is not a word, but actions, worries, opportunities, threats, etc. That is, people living and pursuing shared goals with others. Which new searching tools can help to find trends, innovations and ideas taking consciousness in the context described above? Can IR help to end with this illusion of pseudo-objectivity and manipulation of passive individuals.
1076037	Challenges in running a commercial search engine These are exciting times for Information Retrieval. Web search engines have brought IR to the masses. It now affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people, and growing, as Internet search companies launch ever more products based on techniques developed in These are exciting times for Information Retrieval. Web search engines have brought IR to the masses. It now affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people, and growing, as Internet search companies launch ever more products based on techniques developed in IR research.The real world poses unique challenges for search algorithms. They operate at unprecedented scales, and over a wide diversity of information. In addition, we have entered an unprecedented world of "Adversarial Information Retrieval". The lure of billions of dollars of commerce, guided by search engines, motivates all kinds of people to try all kinds of tricks to get their sites to the top of the search results.What techniques do people use to defeat IR algorithms? What are the evaluation challenges for a web search engine? How much impact has IR had on search engines? How does Google serve over 250 Million queries a day, often with sub-second response times? This talk will show that the world of algorithm and system design for commercial search engines can be described by two of Murphy's Laws: a) If anything can go wrong, it will, and b) If anything cannot go wrong, it will anyway.
1076039	Orthogonal locality preserving indexing We consider the problem of document indexing and representation. Recently, Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace. Different from Latent Semantic Indexing which is optimal in the sense of global Euclidean structure, LPI is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure. However, LPI is extremely sensitive to the number of dimensions. This makes it difficult to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality, while inaccurately estimated dimensionality would drastically degrade its performance. One reason leading to this problem is that LPI is non-orthogonal. Non-orthogonality distorts the metric structure of the document space. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Orthogonal LPI. Orthogonal LPI iteratively computes the mutually orthogonal basis functions which respect the local geometrical structure. Moreover, our empirical study shows that OLPI can have more locality preserving power than LPI. We compare the new algorithm to LSI and LPI. Extensive experimental results show that Orthogonal LPI obtains better performance than both LSI and LPI. More crucially, it is insensitive to the number of dimensions, which makes it an efficient data preprocessing method for text clustering, classification, retrieval, etc.
1076040	Why spectral retrieval works We argue that the ability to identify pairs of related terms is at the heart of what makes spectral retrieval work in practice. Schemes such as latent semantic indexing (LSI) and its descendants have this ability in the sense that they can be viewed as computing a matrix of term-term relatedness scores which is then used to expand the given documents (not the queries). For almost all existing spectral retrieval schemes, this matrix of relatedness scores depends on a fixed low-dimensional subspace of the original term space. We instead vary the dimension and study for each term pair the resultin curve of relatedness scores. We find that it is actually the shape of this curve which is indicative for the term-pair relatedness, and not any of the individual relatedness scores on the curve. We derive two simple, parameterless algorithms that detect this shape and that consistently outperform previous methods on a number of test collections. Our curves also shed light on the effectiveness of three fundamental types of variations of the basic LSI scheme.
1076041	Better than the real thing?: iterative pseudo-query processing using cluster-based language models We present a novel approach to pseudo-feedback-based ad hoc retrieval that uses language models induced from both documents and clusters. First, we treat the pseudo-feedback documents produced in response to the original query as a set of pseudo-query that themselves can serve as input to the retrieval process. Observing that the documents returned in response to the pseudo-query can then act as pseudo-query for subsequent rounds, we arrive at a formulation of pseudo-query-based retrieval as an iterative process. Experiments show that several concrete instantiations of this idea, when applied in conjunction with techniques designed to heighten precision, yield performance results rivaling those of a number of previously-proposed algorithms, including the standard language-modeling approach. The use of cluster-based language models is a key contributing factor to our algorithms' success.
1076042	The maximum entropy method for analyzing retrieval measures We present a model, based on the maximum entropy method, for analyzing various measures of retrieval performance such as average precision, R-precision, and precision-at-cutoffs. Our methodology treats the value of such a measure as a constraint on the distribution of relevant documents in an unknown list, and the maximum entropy distribution can be determined subject to these constraints. For good measures of overall performance (such as average precision), the resulting maximum entropy distributions are highly correlated with actual distributions of relevant documents in lists as demonstrated through TREC data; for poor measures of overall performance, the correlation is weaker. As such, the maximum entropy method can be used to quantify the overall quality of a retrieval measure. Furthermore, for good measures of overall performance (such as average precision), we show that the corresponding maximum entropy distributions can be used to accurately infer precision-recall curves and the values of other measures of performance, and we demonstrate that the quality of these inferences far exceeds that predicted by simple retrieval measure correlation, as demonstrated through TREC data.
1076044	A study of factors affecting the utility of implicit relevance feedback Implicit relevance feedback (IRF) is the process by which a search system unobtrusively gathers evidence on searcher interests from their interaction with the system. IRF is a new method of gathering information on user interest and, if IRF is to be used in operational IR systems, it is important to establish when it performs well and when it performs poorly. In this paper we investigate how the use and effectiveness of IRF is affected by three factors: search task complexity, the search experience of the user and the stage in the search. Our findings suggest that all three of these factors contribute to the utility of IRF.
1076045	Context-sensitive information retrieval using implicit feedback A major limitation of most existing retrieval models and systems is that the retrieval decision is made based solely on the query and document collection; information about the actual user and search context is largely ignored. In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting. We propose several context-sensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents. We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set. Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.
1076046	User term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval To alleviate the vocabulary problem, this paper investigates the role of user term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval. Term feedback refers to the feedback from a user on specific terms regarding their relevance to a target image. Previous studies have indicated the effectiveness of term feedback in interactive text retrieval [14]. However, the term feedback has not shown to be effective in our experiments on text-based image retrieval. Our results indicate that, although term feedback has a positive effect by allowing users to identify more relevant terms, it also has a strong negative effect by providing more opportunities for users to specify irrelevant terms. To understand these different effects and their implications on the potential of term feedback, this paper further presents analysis of important factors that contribute to the utility of term feedback and discusses the outlook of term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval.
1076047	Active feedback in ad hoc information retrieval Information retrieval is, in general, an iterative search process, in which the user often has several interactions with a retrieval system for an information need. The retrieval system can actively probe a user with questions to clarify the information need instead of just passively responding to user queries. A basic question is thus how a retrieval system should propose questions to the user so that it can obtain maximum benefits from the feedback on these questions. In this paper, we study how a retrieval system can perform active feedback, i.e., how to choose documents for relevance feedback so that the system can learn most from the feedback information. We present a general framework for such an active feedback problem, and derive several practical algorithms as special cases. Empirical evaluation of these algorithms shows that the performance of traditional relevance feedback (presenting the top K documents) is consistently worse than that of presenting documents with more diversity. With a diversity-based selection algorithm, we obtain fewer relevant documents, however, these fewer documents have more learning benefits.
1076049	Improving collection selection with overlap awareness in P2P search engines Collection selection has been a research issue for years. Typically, in related work, precomputed statistics are employed in order to estimate the expected result quality of each collection, and subsequently the collections are ranked accordingly. Our thesis is that this simple approach is insufficient for several applications in which the collections typically overlap. This is the case, for example, for the collections built by autonomous peers crawling the web. We argue for the extension of existing quality measures using estimators of mutual overlap among collections and present experiments in which this combination outperforms CORI, a popular approach based on quality estimation. We outline our prototype implementation of a P2P web search engine, coined MINERVA, that allows handling large amounts of data in a distributed and self-organizing manner. We conduct experiments which show that taking overlap into account during collection selection can drastically decrease the number of collections that have to be contacted in order to reach a satisfactory level of recall, which is a great step toward the feasibility of distributed web search.
1076050	Server selection methods in hybrid portal search The TREC.GOV collection makes a valuable web testbed for distributed information retrieval methods because it is naturally partitioned and includes 725 web-oriented queries with judged answers. It can usefully model aspects of government and large corporate portals. Analysis of the.gov data shows that a purely distributed approach would not be feasible for providing search on a.gov portal because of the large number (17,000+) of web sites and the high proportion that do not provide a search interface. An alternative hybrid approach, combining both distributed and centralized techniques, is proposed and server selection methods are evaluated within this framework using web-oriented evaluation methodology. A number of well-known algorithms are compared against representatives (highest anchor ranked page (HARP) and anchor weighted sum (AWSUM)) of a family of new selection methods which use link anchortext extracted from an auxiliary crawl to provide descriptions of sites which are not themselves crawled. Of the previously published methods, ReDDE substantially outperformed three variants of CORI and also outperformed a method based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (extended) except on topic distillation. HARP and AWSUM performed best overall but were outperformed on the topic distillation task by extended KL Divergence.
1076051	Modeling search engine effectiveness for federated search Federated search links multiple search engines into a single, virtual search system. Most prior research of federated search focused on selecting search engines that have the most relevant contents, but ignored the retrieval effectiveness of individual search engines. This omission can cause serious problems when federating search engines of different qualities.This paper proposes a federated search technique that uses utility maximization to model the retrieval effectiveness of each search engine in a federated search environment. The new algorithm ranks the available resources by explicitly estimating the amount of relevant material that each resource can return , instead of the amount of relevant material that each resource contains . An extensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the new algorithm.
1076052	A utility theoretic approach to determining optimal wait times in distributed information retrieval Distributed IR systems query a large number of IR servers, merge the retrieved results and display them to users. Since different servers handle collections of different sizes, have different processing and bandwidth capacities, there can be considerable heterogeneity in their response times. The broker in the distributed IR system thus has to make decisions regarding terminating searches based on perceived value of waiting -- retrieving more documents -- and the costs imposed on users by waiting for more responses. In this paper, we apply utility theory to formulate the broker's decision problem. The problem is a stochastic nonlinear program. We use Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate how the optimal wait time may be determined in the context of a comparison shopping engine that queries multiple store websites for price and product information. We use data gathered from 30 stores for a set of 60 books. Our research demonstrates how a broker can leverage information about past retrievals regarding distributions of server response time and relevance scores to optimize its performance. Our main contribution is the formulation of the decision model for optimal wait time and proposal of a solution method. Our results suggest that the optimal wait time is highly sensitive to the manner in which users value from a set of retrieved results differs from the sum of user value from each result evaluated independently. We also find that the optimal wait time increases with the size of the distributed collections, but only if user utility from a set of results is nearly equal to the sum of utilities from each result.
1076054	Robustness of adaptive filtering methods in a cross-benchmark evaluation This paper reports a cross-benchmark evaluation of regularized logistic regression (LR) and incremental Rocchio for adaptive filtering. Using four corpora from the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) forum and the Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity levels, and measured performance with different utility settings. We found that LR performs strongly and robustly in optimizing T11SU (a TREC utility function) while Rocchio is better for optimizing Ctrk (the TDT tracking cost), a high-recall oriented objective function. Using systematic cross-corpus parameter optimization with both methods, we obtained the best results ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11. Relevance feedback on a small portion (0.05~0.2%) of the TDT5 test documents yielded significant performance improvements, measuring up to a 54% reduction in Ctrk and a 20.9% increase in T11SU (with b=0.1), compared to the results of the top-performing system in TDT2004 without relevance feedback information.
1076055	A probabilistic model for retrospective news event detection Retrospective news event detection (RED) is defined as the discovery of previously unidentified events in historical news corpus. Although both the contents and time information of news articles are helpful to RED, most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of news articles. Few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information. In this paper, we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of news articles. On the one hand, news articles are always aroused by events; on the other hand, similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources. The former hints a generative model of news articles, and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform RED. With consideration of these characteristics, we propose a probabilistic model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified framework. This model gives new representations of both news articles and news events. Furthermore, based on this approach, we build an interactive RED system, HISCOVERY, which provides additional functions to present events, Photo Story and Chronicle .
1076056	Scalable collaborative filtering using cluster-based smoothing Memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In the past, the memory-based approach has been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems: data sparsity and difficulty in scalability. Alternatively, the model-based approach has been proposed to alleviate these problems, but this approach tends to limit the range of users. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of these two approaches by introducing a smoothing-based method. In our approach, clusters generated from the training data provide the basis for data smoothing and neighborhood selection. As a result, we provide higher accuracy as well as increased efficiency in recommendations. Empirical studies on two datasets (EachMovie and MovieLens) show that our new proposed approach consistently outperforms other state-of-art collaborative filtering algorithms.
1076058	OCFS: optimal orthogonal centroid feature selection for text categorization Text categorization is an important research area in many Information Retrieval (IR) applications. To save the storage space and computation time in text categorization, efficient and effective algorithms for reducing the data before analysis are highly desired. Traditional techniques for this purpose can generally be classified into feature extraction and feature selection . Because of efficiency, the latter is more suitable for text data such as web documents. However, many popular feature selection techniques such as Information Gain (IG) and? 2 -test (CHI) are all greedy in nature and thus may not be optimal according to some criterion. Moreover, the performance of these greedy methods may be deteriorated when the reserved data dimension is extremely low. In this paper, we propose an efficient optimal feature selection algorithm by optimizing the objective function of Orthogonal Centroid (OC) subspace learning algorithm in a discrete solution space, called Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection (OCFS). Experiments on 20 Newsgroups (20NG), Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) and Open Directory Project (ODP) data show that OCFS is consistently better than IG and CHI with smaller computation time especially when the reduced dimension is extremely small.
1076059	SimFusion: measuring similarity using unified relationship matrix In this paper we use a Unified Relationship Matrix ( URM ) to represent a set of heterogeneous data objects (e.g., web pages, queries) and their interrelationships (e.g., hyperlinks, user click-through sequences). We claim that iterative computations over the URM can help overcome the data sparseness problem and detect latent relationships among heterogeneous data objects, thus, can improve the quality of information applications that require com- bination of information from heterogeneous sources. To support our claim, we present a unified similarity-calculating algorithm, SimFusion . By iteratively computing over the URM, SimFusion can effectively integrate relationships from heterogeneous sources when measuring the similarity of two data objects. Experiments based on a web search engine query log and a web page collection demonstrate that SimFusion can improve similarity measurement of web objects over both traditional content based algorithms and the cutting edge SimRank algorithm.
1076060	An application of text categorization methods to gene ontology annotation This paper describes an application of IR and text categorization methods to a highly practical problem in biomedicine, specifically, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. GO annotation is a major activity in most model organism database projects and annotates gene functions using a controlled vocabulary. As a first step toward automatic GO annotation, we aim to assign GO domain codes given a specific gene and an article in which the gene appears, which is one of the task challenges at the TREC 2004 Genomics Track. We approached the task with careful consideration of the specialized terminology and paid special attention to dealing with various forms of gene synonyms, so as to exhaustively locate the occurrences of the target gene. We extracted the words around the gene occurrences and used them to represent the gene for GO domain code annotation. As a classifier, we adopted a variant of k-Nearest Neighbor ( k NN) with supervised term weighting schemes to improve the performance, making our method among the top-performing systems in the TREC official evaluation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our proposed framework is successfully applied to another task of the Genomics Track, showing comparable results to the best performing system.
1076062	Combining eye movements and collaborative filtering for proactive information retrieval We study a new task, proactive information retrieval by combining implicit relevance feedback and collaborative filtering. We have constructed a controlled experimental setting, a prototype application, in which the users try to find interesting scientific articles by browsing their titles. Implicit feedback is inferred from eye movement signals, with discriminative hidden Markov models estimated from existing data in which explicit relevance feedback is available. Collaborative filtering is carried out using the User Rating Profile model, a state-of-the-art probabilistic latent variable model, computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For new document titles the prediction accuracy with eye movements, collaborative filtering, and their combination was significantly better than by chance. The best prediction accuracy still leaves room for improvement but shows that proactive information retrieval and combination of many sources of relevance feedback is feasible.
1076063	Accurately interpreting clickthrough data as implicit feedback This paper examines the reliability of implicit feedback generated from clickthrough data in WWW search. Analyzing the users' decision process using eyetracking and comparing implicit feedback against manual relevance judgments, we conclude that clicks are informative but biased. While this makes the interpretation of clicks as absolute relevance judgments difficult, we show that relative preferences derived from clicks are reasonably accurate on average.
1076064	Information retrieval system evaluation: effort, sensitivity, and reliability The effectiveness of information retrieval systems is measured by comparing performance on a common set of queries and documents. Significance tests are often used to evaluate the reliability of such comparisons. Previous work has examined such tests, but produced results with limited application. Other work established an alternative benchmark for significance, but the resulting test was too stringent. In this paper, we revisit the question of how such tests should be used. We find that the t-test is highly reliable (more so than the sign or Wilcoxon test), and is far more reliable than simply showing a large percentage difference in effectiveness measures between IR systems. Our results show that past empirical work on significance tests over-estimated the error of such tests. We also re-consider comparisons between the reliability of precision at rank 10 and mean average precision, arguing that past comparisons did not consider the assessor effort required to compute such measures. This investigation shows that assessor effort would be better spent building test collections with more topics, each assessed in less detail.
1076066	Detecting phrase-level duplication on the world wide web Two years ago, we conducted a study on the evolution of web pages over time. In the course of that study, we discovered a large number of machine-generated "spam" web pages emanating from a handful of web servers in Germany. These spam web pages were dynamically assembled by stitching together grammatically well-formed German sentences drawn from a large collection of sentences. This discovery motivated us to develop techniques for finding other instances of such "slice and dice" generation of web pages, where pages are automatically generated by stitching together phrases drawn from a limited corpus. We applied these techniques to two data sets, a set of 151 million web pages collected in December 2002 and a set of 96 million web pages collected in June 2004. We found a number of other instances of large-scale phrase-level replication within the two data sets. This paper describes the algorithms we used to discover this type of replication, and highlights the results of our data mining.
1076067	Using ODP metadata to personalize search The Open Directory Project is clearly one of the largest collaborative efforts to manually annotate web pages. This effort involves over 65,000 editors and resulted in metadata specifying topic and importance for more than 4 million web pages. Still, given that this number is just about 0.05 percent of the Web pages indexed by Google, is this effort enough to make a difference? In this paper we discuss how these metadata can be exploited to achieve high quality personalized web search. First, we address this by introducing an additional criterion for web page ranking, namely the distance between a user profile defined using ODP topics and the sets of ODP topics covered by each URL returned in regular web search. We empirically show that this enhancement yields better results than current web search using Google. Then, in the second part of the paper, we investigate the boundaries of biasing PageRank on subtopics of the ODP in order to automatically extend these metadata to the whole web.
1076068	Exploiting the hierarchical structure for link analysis Link analysis algorithms have been extensively used in Web information retrieval. However, current link analysis algorithms generally work on a flat link graph, ignoring the hierarchal structure of the Web graph. They often suffer from two problems: the sparsity of link graph and biased ranking of newly-emerging pages. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking algorithm called Hierarchical Rank as a solution to these two problems, which considers both the hierarchical structure and the link structure of the Web. In this algorithm, Web pages are first aggregated based on their hierarchical structure at directory, host or domain level and link analysis is performed on the aggregated graph. Then, the importance of each node on the aggregated graph is distributed to individual pages belong to the node based on the hierarchical structure. This algorithm allows the importance of linked Web pages to be distributed in the Web page space even when the space is sparse and contains new pages. Experimental results on the .GOV collection of TREC 2003 and 2004 show that hierarchical ranking algorithm consistently outperforms other well-known ranking algorithms, including the PageRank, BlockRank and LayerRank. In addition, experimental results show that link aggregation at the host level is much better than link aggregation at either the domain or directory levels.
1076070	Web-page summarization using clickthrough data Most previous Web-page summarization methods treat a Web page as plain text. However, such methods fail to uncover the full knowledge associated with a Web page needed in building a high-quality summary, because many of these methods do not consider the hidden relationships in the Web. Uncovering the hidden knowledge is important in building good Web-page summarizers. In this paper, we extract the extra knowledge from the clickthrough data of a Web search engine to improve Web-page summarization. Wefirst analyze the feasibility in utilizing the clickthrough data to enhance Web-page summarization and then propose two adapted summarization methods that take advantage of the relationships discovered from the clickthrough data. For those pages that are not covered by the clickthrough data, we design a thematic lexicon approach to generate implicit knowledge for them. Our methods are evaluated on a dataset consisting of manually annotated pages as well as a large dataset that is crawled from the Open Directory Project website. The experimental results indicate that significant improvements can be achieved through our proposed summarizer as compared to the summarizers that do not use the clickthrough data.
1076071	Topic themes for multi-document summarization The problem of using topic representations for multi-document summarization (MDS) has received considerable attention recently. In this paper, we describe five different topic representations and introduce a novel representation of topics based on topic themes. We present eight different methods of generating MDS and evaluate each of these methods on a large set of topics used in past DUC workshops. Our evaluation results show a significant improvement in the quality of summaries based on topic themes over MDS methods that use other alternative topic representations.
1076072	Do summaries help? We describe a task-based evaluation to determine whether multi-document summaries measurably improve user performance whe using online news browsing systems for directed research. We evaluated the multi-document summaries generated by Newsblaster, a robust news browsing system that clusters online news articles and summarizes multiple articles on each event. Four groups of subjects were asked to perform the same time-restricted fact-gathering tasks, reading news under different conditions: no summaries at all, single sentence summaries drawn from one of the articles, Newsblaster multi-document summaries, and human summaries. Our results show that, in comparison to source documents only, the quality of reports assembled using Newsblaster summaries was significantly better and user satisfaction was higher with both Newsblaster and human summaries.
1076074	Optimization strategies for complex queries Previous research into the efficiency of text retrieval systems has dealt primarily with methods that consider inverted lists in sequence; these methods are known as term-at-a-time methods. However, the literature for optimizing document-at-a-time systems remains sparse.We present an improvement to the max_score optimization, which is the most efficient known document-at-a-time scoring method. Like max_score, our technique, called term bounded max_score, is guaranteed to return exactly the same scores and documents as an unoptimized evaluation, which is particularly useful for query model research. We simulated our technique to explore the problem space, then implemented it in Indri, our large scale language modeling search engine. Tests with the GOV2 corpus on title queries show our method to be 23% faster than max_score alone, and 61% faster than our document-at-a-time baseline. Our optimized query times are competitive with conventional term-at-a-time systems on this year's TREC Terabyte task.
1076075	Simplified similarity scoring using term ranks We propose a method for document ranking that combines a simple document-centric view of text, and fast evaluation strategies that have been developed in connection with the vector space model. The new method defines the importance of a term within a document qualitatively rather than quantitatively, and in doing so reduces the need for tuning parameters. In addition, the method supports very fast query processing, with most of the computation carried out on small integers, and dynamic pruning an effective option. Experiments on a wide range of TREC data show that the new method provides retrieval effectiveness as good as or better than the Okapi BM25 formulation, and variants of language models.
1076076	Efficiently decodable and searchable natural language adaptive compression We address the problem of adaptive compression of natural language text, focusing on the case where low bandwidth is available and the receiver has little processing power, as in mobile applications. Our technique achieves compression ratios around 32% and requires very little effort from the receiver. This tradeoff, not previously achieved with alternative techniques, is obtained by breaking the usual symmetry between sender and receiver dominant in statistical adaptive compression. Moreover, we show that our technique can be adapted to avoid decompression at all in cases where the receiver only wants to detect the presence of some keywords in the document. This is useful in scenarios such as selective dissemination of information, news clipping, alert systems, text categorization, and clustering. Thanks to the asymmetry we introduce, the receiver can search the compressed text much faster than the plain text. This was previously achieved only in semistatic compression scenarios.
1076077	Efficient and self-tuning incremental query expansion for top-k query processing We present a novel approach for efficient and self-tuning query expansion that is embedded into a top-k query processor with candidate pruning. Traditional query expansion methods select expansion terms whose thematic similarity to the original query terms is above some specified threshold, thus generating a disjunctive query with much higher dimensionality. This poses three major problems: 1) the need for hand-tuning the expansion threshold, 2) the potential topic dilution with overly aggressive expansion, and 3) the drastically increased execution cost of a high-dimensional query. The method developed in this paper addresses all three problems by dynamically and incrementally merging the inverted lists for the potential expansion terms with the lists for the original query terms. A priority queue is used for maintaining result candidates, the pruning of candidates is based on Fagin's family of top-k algorithms, and optionally probabilistic estimators of candidate scores can be used for additional pruning. Experiments on the TREC collections for the 2004 Robust and Terabyte tracks demonstrate the increased efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our approach.
1076079	Title extraction from bodies of HTML documents and its application to web page retrieval This paper is concerned with automatic extraction of titles from the bodies of HTML documents. Titles of HTML documents should be correctly defined in the title fields; however, in reality HTML titles are often bogus. It is desirable to conduct automatic extraction of titles from the bodies of HTML documents. This is an issue which does not seem to have been investigated previously. In this paper, we take a supervised machine learning approach to address the problem. We propose a specification on HTML titles. We utilize format information such as font size, position, and font weight as features in title extraction. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline method of using the lines in largest font size as title (20.9%-32.6% improvement in F1 score). As application, we consider web page retrieval. We use the TREC Web Track data for evaluation. We propose a new method for HTML documents retrieval using extracted titles. Experimental results indicate that the use of both extracted titles and title fields is almost always better than the use of title fields alone; the use of extracted titles is particularly helpful in the task of named page finding (23.1% -29.0% improvements).
1076080	Multi-label informed latent semantic indexing Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a well-known unsupervised approach for dimensionality reduction in information retrieval. However if the output information (i.e. category labels) is available, it is often beneficial to derive the indexing not only based on the inputs but also on the target values in the training data set. This is of particular importance in applications with multiple labels , in which each document can belong to several categories simultaneously. In this paper we introduce the multi-label informed latent semantic indexing (MLSI) algorithm which preserves the information of inputs and meanwhile captures the correlations between the multiple outputs. The recovered "latent semantics" thus incorporate the human-annotated category information and can be used to greatly improve the prediction accuracy. Empirical study based on two data sets, Reuters-21578 and RCV1, demonstrates very encouraging results.
1076081	Text classification with kernels on the multinomial manifold Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been very successful in text classification. However, the intrinsic geometric structure of text data has been ignored by standard kernels commonly used in SVMs. It is natural to assume that the documents are on the multinomial manifold, which is the simplex of multinomial models furnished with the Riemannian structure induced by the Fisher information metric. We prove that the Negative Geodesic Distance (NGD) on the multinomial manifold is conditionally positive definite (cpd), thus can be used as a kernel in SVMs. Experiments show the NGD kernel on the multinomial manifold to be effective for text classification, significantly outperforming standard kernels on the ambient Euclidean space.
1076082	Multi-labelled classification using maximum entropy method Many classification problems require classifiers to assign each single document into more than one category, which is called multi-labelled classification . The categories in such problems usually are neither conditionally independent from each other nor mutually exclusive, therefore it is not trivial to directly employ state-of-the-art classification algorithms without losing information of relation among categories. In this paper, we explore correlations among categories with maximum entropy method and derive a classification algorithm for multi-labelled documents. Our experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the combination of single label approach.
1076084	Relevance information: a loss of entropy but a gain for IDF? When investigating alternative estimates for term discriminativeness, we discovered that relevance information and idf are much closer related than formulated in classical literature. Therefore, we revisited the justification of idf as it follows from the binary independent retrieval (BIR) model. The main result is a formal framework uncovering the close relationship of a generalised idf and the BIR model. The framework makes explicit how to incorporate relevance information into any retrieval function that involves an idf -component.In addition to the idf -based formulation of the BIR model, we propose Poisson-based estimates as an alternative to the classical estimates, this being motivated by the superiority of Poisson-based estimates for the within-document term frequencies. The main experimental finding is that a Poisson-based idf is superior to the classical idf , where the superiority is particularly evident for long queries.
1076085	Linear discriminant model for information retrieval This paper presents a new discriminative model for information retrieval (IR), referred to as linear discriminant model (LDM), which provides a flexible framework to incorporate arbitrary features. LDM is different from most existing models in that it takes into account a variety of linguistic features that are derived from the component models of HMM that is widely used in language modeling approaches to IR. Therefore, LDM is a means of melding discriminative and generative models for IR. We present two algorithms of parameter learning for LDM. One is to optimize the average precision (AP) directly using an iterative procedure. The other is a perceptron-based algorithm that minimizes the number of discordant document-pairs in a rank list. The effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated on the task of ad hoc retrieval using six English and Chinese TREC test sets. Results show that (1) in most test sets, LDM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art language modeling approaches and the classical probabilistic retrieval model; (2) it is more appropriate to train LDM using a measure of AP rather than likelihood if the IR system is graded on AP; and (3) linguistic features (e.g. phrases and dependences) are effective for IR if they are incorporated properly.
1076086	Integrating word relationships into language models In this paper, we propose a novel dependency language modeling approach for information retrieval. The approach extends the existing language modeling approach by relaxing the independence assumption. Our goal is to build a language model in which various word relationships can be integrated. In this work, we integrate two types of relationship extracted from WordNet and co-occurrence relationships respectively. The integrated model has been tested on several TREC collections. The results show that our model achieves substantial and significant improvements with respect to the models without these relationships. These results clearly show the benefit of integrating word relationships into language models for IR.
1076087	PageRank without hyperlinks: structural re-ranking using links induced by language models Inspired by the PageRank and HITS (hubs and authorities) algorithms for Web search, we propose a structural re-ranking approach to ad hoc information retrieval: we reorder the documents in an initially retrieved set by exploiting asymmetric relationships between them. Specifically, we consider generation links , which indicate that the language model induced from one document assigns high probability to the text of another; in doing so, we take care to prevent bias against long documents. We study a number of re-ranking criteria based on measures of centrality in the graphs formed by generation links, and show that integrating centrality into standard language-model-based retrieval is quite effective at improving precision at top ranks.
1076089	Controlling overlap in content-oriented XML retrieval The direct application of standard ranking techniques to retrieve individual elements from a collection of XML documents often produces a result set in which the top ranks are dominated by a large number of elements taken from a small number of highly relevant documents. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that re-ranks this result set, with the aim of minimizing redundant content while preserving the benefits of element retrieval, including the benefit of identifying topic-focused components contained within relevant documents. The test collection developed by the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) forms the basis for the evaluation.
1076090	Publish/subscribe functionality in IR environments using structured overlay networks We study the problem of offering publish/subscribe functionality on top of structured overlay networks using data models and languages from IR. We show how to achieve this by extending the distributed hash table Chord and present a detailed experimental evaluation of our proposals.
1076091	Learning to extract information from semi-structured text using a discriminative context free grammar In recent work, conditional Markov chain models (CMM) have been used to extract information from semi-structured text (one example is the Conditional Random Field [10]). Applications range from finding the author and title in research papers to finding the phone number and street address in a web page. The CMM framework combines a priori knowledge encoded as features with a set of labeled training data to learn an efficient extraction process. We will show that similar problems can be solved more effectively by learning a discriminative context free grammar from training data. The grammar has several distinct advantages: long range, even global, constraints can be used to disambiguate entity labels; training data is used more efficiently; and a set of new more powerful features can be introduced. The grammar based approach also results in semantic information (encoded in the form of a parse tree) which could be used for IR applications like question answering. The specific problem we consider is of extracting personal contact, or address, information from unstructured sources such as documents and emails. While linear-chain CMMs perform reasonably well on this task, we show that a statistical parsing approach results in a 50% reduction in error rate. This system also has the advantage of being interactive, similar to the system described in [9]. In cases where there are multiple errors, a single user correction can be propagated to correct multiple errors automatically. Using a discriminatively trained grammar, 93.71% of all tokens are labeled correctly (compared to 88.43% for a CMM) and 72.87% of records have all tokens labeled correctly (compared to 45.29% for the CMM).
1076093	Web-based acquisition of Japanese katakana variants This paper describes a method of detecting Japanese Katakana variants from a large corpus. Katakana words, which are mainly used as loanwords, cause problems with information retrieval and so on, because transliteration creates several variations in spelling and all of these can be orthographic. Previous works manually defined Katakana rewrite rules such as %Y ( be ) and %t%' ( ve ) being replaceable with each other, for generating variants and also defined the weight of each operation to edit one string into another to detect these variants. However, these previous researches have not been able to keep up with the ever-increasing number of loanwords and their variants. With our method proposed in this paper, the weight of each edit operation is mechanically assigned based on Web data. In experiments, it performed almost as well as one with manually determined weights. Thus, the advantages of our method are: 1) need no expertise in linguistics to determine weight of each operation, and 2) able to keep up with new Katakana loanwords only by collecting text data from Web and acquiring new weights of edit operations automatically. It also achieved 98.6% recall and 86.3% precision in the task of extracting Katakana variant pairs from 38 year's worth of corpora of Japanese newspaper articles.
1076094	On the collective classification of email speech acts We consider classification of email messages as to whether or not they contain certain "email acts", such as a request or a commitment. We show that exploiting the sequential correlation among email messages in the same thread can improve email-act classification. More specifically, we describe a new text-classification algorithm based on a dependency-network based collective classification method, in which the local classifiers are maximum entropy models based on words and certain relational features. We show that statistically significant improvements over a bag-of-words baseline classifier can be obtained for some, but not all, email-act classes. Performance improvements obtained by collective classification appears to be consistent across many email acts suggested by prior speech-act theory.
1076095	Using term informativeness for named entity detection Informal communication (e-mail, bulletin boards) poses a difficult learning environment because traditional grammatical and lexical information are noisy. Other information is necessary for tasks such as named entity detection. How topic-centric, or informative, a word is can be valuable information. It is well known that informative words are best modeled by "heavy-tailed" distributions, such as mixture models. However, informativeness scores do not take full advantage of this fact. We introduce a new informativeness score that directly utilizes mixture model likelihood to identify informative words. We use the task of extracting restaurant names from bulletin board posts as a way to determine effectiveness. We find that our "mixture score" is weakly effective alone and highly effective when combined with Inverse Document Frequency. We compare against other informativeness criteria and find that only Residual IDF is competitive against our combined IDF/Mixture score.
1076097	Automatic music video summarization based on audio-visual-text analysis and alignment In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic music video summarization based on audio-visual-text analysis and alignment. The music video is separated into the music and video tracks. For the music track, the chorus is detected based on music structure analysis. For the video track, we first segment the shots and classify the shots into close-up face shots and non-face shots, then we extract the lyrics and detect the most repeated lyrics from the shots. The music video summary is generated based on the alignment of boundaries of the detected chorus, shot class and the most repeated lyrics from the music video. The experiments on chorus detection, shot classification, and lyrics detection using 20 English music videos are described. Subjective user studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of summary. The comparisons with the summaries based on our previous method and the manual method indicate that the results of summarization using the proposed method are better at meeting users' expectations.
1076098	A phonotactic-semantic paradigm for automatic spoken document classification We demonstrate a phonotactic-semantic paradigm for spoken document categorization. In this framework, we define a set of acoustic words instead of lexical words to represent acoustic activities in spoken languages. The strategy for acoustic vocabulary selection is studied by comparing different feature selection methods. With an appropriate acoustic vocabulary, a voice tokenizer converts a spoken document into a text-like document of acoustic words. Thus, a spoken document can be represented by a count vector, named a bag-of-sounds vector, which characterizes a spoken document's semantic domain. We study two phonotactic-semantic classifiers, the support vector machine classifier and the latent semantic analysis classifier, and their properties. The phonotactic-semantic framework constitutes a new paradigm in spoken document classification, as demonstrated by its success in the spoken language identification task. It achieves 18.2% error reduction over state-of-the-art benchmark performance on the 1996 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation database.
1076099	Boosted decision trees for word recognition in handwritten document retrieval Recognition and retrieval of historical handwritten material is an unsolved problem. We propose a novel approach to recognizing and retrieving handwritten manuscripts, based upon word image classification as a key step. Decision trees with normalized pixels as features form the basis of a highly accurate AdaBoost classifier, trained on a corpus of word images that have been resized and sampled at a pyramid of resolutions. To stem problems from the highly skewed distribution of class frequencies, word classes with very few training samples are augmented with stochastically altered versions of the originals. This increases recognition performance substantially. On a standard corpus of 20 pages of handwritten material from the George Washington collection the recognition performance shows a substantial improvement in performance over previous published results (75% vs 65%). Following word recognition, retrieval is done using a language model over the recognized words. Retrieval performance also shows substantially improved results over previously published results on this database. Recognition/retrieval results on a more challenging database of 100 pages from the George Washington collection are also presented.
1076101	Generic soft pattern models for definitional question answering This paper explores probabilistic lexico-syntactic pattern matching, also known as soft pattern matching . While previous methods in soft pattern matching are ad hoc in computing the degree of match, we propose two formal matching models: one based on bigrams and the other on the Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models provide a theoretically sound method to model pattern matching as a probabilistic process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We show that both models significantly outperform state-of-the-art manually constructed patterns. A critical difference between the two models is that the PHMM technique handles language variations more effectively but requires more training data to converge. We believe that both models can be extended to other areas where lexico-syntactic pattern matching can be applied.
1076102	Evaluation of resources for question answering evaluation Controlled and reproducible laboratory experiments, enabled by reusable test collections, represent a well-established methodology in modern information retrieval research. In order to confidently draw conclusions about the performance of different retrieval methods using test collections, their reliability and trustworthiness must first be established. Although such studies have been performed for ad hoc test collections, currently available resources for evaluating question answering systems have not been similarly analyzed. This study evaluates the quality of answer patterns and lists of relevant documents currently employed in automatic question answering evaluation, and concludes that they are not suitable for post-hoc experimentation. These resources, created from runs submitted by TREC QA track participants, do not produce fair and reliable assessments of systems that did not participate in the original evaluations. Potential solutions for addressing this evaluation gap and their shortcomings are discussed.
1076103	Question answering passage retrieval using dependency relations State-of-the-art question answering (QA) systems employ term-density ranking to retrieve answer passages. Such methods often retrieve incorrect passages as relationships among question terms are not considered. Previous studies attempted to address this problem by matching dependency relations between questions and answers. They used strict matching, which fails when semantically equivalent relationships are phrased differently. We propose fuzzy relation matching based on statistical models. We present two methods for learning relation mapping scores from past QA pairs: one based on mutual information and the other on expectation maximization. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art density-based passage retrieval methods by up to 78% in mean reciprocal rank. Relation matching also brings about a 50% improvement in a system enhanced by query expansion.
1076105	A study of relevance propagation for web search Different from traditional information retrieval, both content and structure are critical to the success of Web information retrieval. In recent years, many relevance propagation techniques have been proposed to propagate content information between web pages through web structure to improve the performance of web search. In this paper, we first propose a generic relevance propagation framework, and then provide a comparison study on the effectiveness and efficiency of various representative propagation models that can be derived from this generic framework. We come to many conclusions that are useful for selecting a propagation model in real-world search applications, including 1) sitemap-based propagation models outperform hyperlink-based models in sense of both effectiveness and efficiency, and 2) sitemap-based term propagation is easier to be integrated into real-world search engines because of its parallel offline implementation and acceptable complexity. Some other more detailed study results are also reported in the paper.
1076106	Relevance weighting for query independent evidence A query independent feature, relating perhaps to document content, linkage or usage, can be transformed into a static, per-document relevance weight for use in ranking. The challenge is to find a good function to transform feature values into relevance scores. This paper presents FLOE, a simple density analysis method for modelling the shape of the transformation required, based on training data and without assuming independence between feature and baseline. For a new query independent feature, it addresses the questions: is it required for ranking, what sort of transformation is appropriate and, after adding it, how successful was the chosen transformation? Based on this we apply sigmoid transformations to PageRank, indegree, URL Length and ClickDistance, tested in combination with a BM25 baseline.
1076107	Detecting dominant locations from search queries Accurately and effectively detecting the locations where search queries are truly about has huge potential impact on increasing search relevance. In this paper, we define a search query's dominant location (QDL) and propose a solution to correctly detect it. QDL is geographical location(s) associated with a query in collective human knowledge, i.e., one or few prominent locations agreed by majority of people who know the answer to the query. QDL is a subjective and collective attribute of search queries and we are able to detect QDLs from both queries containing geographical location names and queries not containing them. The key challenges to QDL detection include false positive suppression (not all contained location names in queries mean geographical locations), and detecting implied locations by the context of the query. In our solution, a query is recursively broken into atomic tokens according to its most popular web usage for reducing false positives. If we do not find a dominant location in this step, we mine the top search results and/or query logs (with different approaches discussed in this paper) to discover implicit query locations. Our large-scale experiments on recent MSN Search queries show that our query location detection solution has consistent high accuracy for all query frequency ranges.
1076109	When will information retrieval be good enough? We describe a user study that examined the relationship between the quality of an Information Retrieval system and the effectiveness of its users in performing a task. The task involves finding answer facets of questions pertaining to a collection of newswire documents over a six month period. We artificially created sets of ranked lists at increasing levels of quality by blending the output of a state-of-the-art retrieval system with truth data created by annotators. Subjects performed the task by using these ranked lists to guide their labeling of answer passages in the retrieved articles. We found that as system accuracy improves, subject time on task and error rate decrease, and the rate of finding new correct answers increases. There is a large intermediary region in which the utility difference is not significant; our results suggest that there is some threshold of accuracy for this task beyond which user utility improves rapidly, but more experiments are needed to examine the area around that threshold closely.
1076110	Modeling task-genre relationships for IR in the workplace Context influences the search process, but to date research has not definitively identified which aspects of context are the most influential for information retrieval, and thus are worthy of integration in today's retrieval systems. In this research, we isolated for examination two aspects of context: task and document genre and examined the relationship between them within a software engineering work domain. In this domain, the nature of the task has an impact on decisions of relevance and usefulness, and the document collection contains a distinctive set of genre. Our data set was a document repository created and used by our target population. The document surrogates were meta-tagged by purpose and document type. Correspondence analysis of this categorical data identified some specific relationships between genres and tasks, as well as four broad dimensions of variability underlying these relationships. These results have the potential to inform the design of a contextual retrieval system by refining search results for this domain.
1076111	Personalizing search via automated analysis of interests and activities We formulate and study search algorithms that consider a user's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user's current Web search. Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search. We show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current Web search.
1076112	The loquacious user: a document-independent source of terms for query expansion In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of a document-independent technique for eliciting feedback from users about their information problems. We propose that such a technique can be used to elicit terms from users for use in query expansion and as a follow-up when ambiguous queries are initially posed by users. We design a feedback form to obtain additional information from users, administer the form to users after initial querying, and create a series of experimental runs based on the information that we obtained from the form. Results demonstrate that the form was successful at eliciting more information from users and that this additional information significantly improved retrieval performance. Our results further demonstrate a strong relationship between query length and performance.
1076114	A study of the dirichlet priors for term frequency normalisation In Information Retrieval (IR), the Dirichlet Priors have been applied to the smoothing technique of the language modeling approach. In this paper, we apply the Dirichlet Priors to the term frequency normalisation of the classical BM25 probabilistic model and the Divergence from Randomness PL2 model. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, through extensive experiments on four TREC collections, we show that the newly generated models, to which the Dirichlet Priors normalisation is applied, provide robust and effective performance. Second, we propose a novel theoretically-driven approach to the automatic parameter tuning of the Dirichlet Priors normalisation. Experiments show that this tuning approach optimises the retrieval performance of the newly generated Dirichlet Priors-based weighting models.
1076115	A Markov random field model for term dependencies This paper develops a general, formal framework for modeling term dependencies via Markov random fields. The model allows for arbitrary text features to be incorporated as evidence. In particular, we make use of features based on occurrences of single terms, ordered phrases, and unordered phrases. We explore full independence, sequential dependence, and full dependence variants of the model. A novel approach is developed to train the model that directly maximizes the mean average precision rather than maximizing the likelihood of the training data. Ad hoc retrieval experiments are presented on several newswire and web collections, including the GOV2 collection used at the TREC 2004 Terabyte Track. The results show significant improvements are possible by modeling dependencies, especially on the larger web collections.
1076116	An exploration of axiomatic approaches to information retrieval Existing retrieval models generally do not offer any guarantee for optimal retrieval performance. Indeed, it is even difficult, if not impossible, to predict a model's empirical performance analytically . This limitation is at least partly caused by the way existing retrieval models are developed where relevance is only coarsely modeled at the level of documents and queries as opposed to a finer granularity level of terms. In this paper, we present a new axiomatic approach to developing retrieval models based on direct modeling of relevance with formalized retrieval constraints defined at the level of terms. The basic idea of this axiomatic approach is to search in a space of candidate retrieval functions for one that can satisfy a set of reasonable retrieval constraints. To constrain the search space, we propose to define a retrieval function inductively and decompose a retrieval function into three component functions. Inspired by the analysis of the existing retrieval functions with the inductive definition, we derive several new retrieval functions using the axiomatic retrieval framework. Experiment results show that the derived new retrieval functions are more robust and less sensitive to parameter settings than the existing retrieval functions with comparable optimal performance.
1076117	Gravitation-based model for information retrieval This paper proposes GBM (gravitation-based model), a physical model for information retrieval inspired by Newton's theory of gravitation. A mapping is built in this model from concepts of information retrieval (documents, queries, relevance, etc) to those of physics (mass, distance, radius, attractive force, etc). This model actually provides a new perspective on IR problems. A family of effective term weighting functions can be derived from it, including the well-known BM25 formula. This model has some advantages over most existing ones: First, because it is directly based on basic physical laws, the derived formulas and algorithms can have their explicit physical interpretation. Second, the ranking formulas derived from this model satisfy more intuitive heuristics than most of existing ones, thus have the potential to behave empirically better and to be used safely on various settings. Finally, a new approach for structured document retrieval derived from this model is more reasonable and behaves better than existing ones.
1076119	Impedance coupling in content-targeted advertising The current boom of the Web is associated with the revenues originated from on-line advertising. While search-based advertising is dominant, the association of ads with a Web page (during user navigation) is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we study the problem of associating ads with a Web page, referred to as content-targeted advertising, from a computer science perspective. We assume that we have access to the text of the Web page, the keywords declared by an advertiser, and a text associated with the advertiser's business. Using no other information and operating in fully automatic fashion, we propose ten strategies for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness. Our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem (referred to as AAK for "ads and keywords") can yield gains in average precision figures of 60% compared to a trivial vector-based strategy. Further, a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy, which expands the text of the Web page to reduce vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement, can yield extra gains in average precision of 50%. These are first results. They suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms.
1076120	Improving web search results using affinity graph In this paper, we propose a novel ranking scheme named Affinity Ranking (AR) to re-rank search results by optimizing two metrics: (1) diversity -- which indicates the variance of topics in a group of documents; (2) information richness -- which measures the coverage of a single document to its topic. Both of the two metrics are calculated from a directed link graph named Affinity Graph (AG). AG models the structure of a group of documents based on the asymmetric content similarities between each pair of documents. Experimental results in Yahoo! Directory, ODP Data, and Newsgroup data demonstrate that our proposed ranking algorithm significantly improves the search performance. Specifically, the algorithm achieves 31% improvement in diversity and 12% improvement in information richness relatively within the top 10 search results.
1076121	Learning to estimate query difficulty: including applications to missing content detection and distributed information retrieval In this article we present novel learning methods for estimating the quality of results returned by a search engine in response to a query. Estimation is based on the agreement between the top results of the full query and the top results of its sub-queries. We demonstrate the usefulness of quality estimation for several applications, among them improvement of retrieval, detecting queries for which no relevant content exists in the document collection, and distributed information retrieval. Experiments on TREC data demonstrate the robustness and the effectiveness of our learning algorithms.
1076123	Iterative translation disambiguation for cross-language information retrieval Finding a proper distribution of translation probabilities is one of the most important factors impacting the effectiveness of a cross-language information retrieval system. In this paper we present a new approach that computes translation probabilities for a given query by using only a bilingual dictionary and a monolingual corpus in the target language. The algorithm combines term association measures with an iterative machine learning approach based on expectation maximization. Our approach considers only pairs of translation candidates and is therefore less sensitive to data-sparseness issues than approaches using higher n-grams. The learned translation probabilities are used as query term weights and integrated into a vector-space retrieval system. Results for English-German cross-lingual retrieval show substantial improvements over a baseline using dictionary lookup without term weighting.
1076124	Bootstrapping dictionaries for cross-language information retrieval The bottleneck for dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval is the lack of comprehensive dictionaries, in particular for many different languages. We here introduce a methodology by which multilingual dictionaries (for Spanish and Swedish) emerge automatically from simple seed lexicons. These seed lexicons are automatically generated, by cognate mapping, from (previously manually constructed) Portuguese and German as well as English sources. Lexical and semantic hypotheses are then validated and new ones iteratively generated by making use of co-occurrence patterns of hypothesized translation synonyms in parallel corpora. We evaluate these newly derived dictionaries on a large medical document collection within a cross-language retrieval setting.
1076125	A maximum coherence model for dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval One key to cross-language information retrieval is how to efficiently resolve the translation ambiguity of queries given their short length. This problem is even more challenging when only bilingual dictionaries are available, which is the focus of this paper. In the previous research of cross-language information retrieval using bilingual dictionaries, the word co-occurrence statistics is used to determine the most likely translations of queries. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical model, named ``maximum coherence model'', which estimates the translation probabilities of query words that are consistent with the word co-occurrence statistics. Unlike the previous work, where a binary decision is made for the selection of translations, the new model maintains the uncertainty in translating query words when their sense ambiguity is difficult to resolve. Furthermore, this new model is able to estimate translations of multiple query words simultaneously. This is in contrast to many previous approaches where translations of individual query words are determined independently. Empirical studies with TREC datasets have shown that the maximum coherence model achieves a relative 10% - 40% improvement in cross-language information retrieval, comparing to other approaches that also use word co-occurrence statistics for sense disambiguation.
1076127	Hidden Markov models for automatic annotation and content-based retrieval of images and video This paper introduces a novel method for automatic annotation of images with keywords from a generic vocabulary of concepts or objects for the purpose of content-based image retrieval. An image, represented as sequence of feature-vectors characterizing low-level visual features such as color, texture or oriented-edges, is modeled as having been stochastically generated by a hidden Markov model, whose states represent concepts. The parameters of the model are estimated from a set of manually annotated (training) images. Each image in a large test collection is then automatically annotated with the a posteriori probability of concepts present in it. This annotation supports content-based search of the image-collection via keywords. Various aspects of model parameterization, parameter estimation, and image annotation are discussed. Empirical retrieval results are presented on two image-collections | COREL and key-frames from TRECVID. Comparisons are made with two other recently developed techniques on the same datasets.
1076128	Exploiting ontologies for automatic image annotation Automatic image annotation is the task of automatically assigning words to an image that describe the content of the image. Machine learning approaches have been explored to model the association between words and images from an annotated set of images and generate annotations for a test image. The paper proposes methods to use a hierarchy defined on the annotation words derived from a text ontology to improve automatic image annotation and retrieval. Specifically, the hierarchy is used in the context of generating a visual vocabulary for representing images and as a framework for the proposed hierarchical classification approach for automatic image annotation. The effect of using the hierarchy in generating the visual vocabulary is demonstrated by improvements in the annotation performance of translation models. In addition to performance improvements, hierarchical classification approaches yield well to constructing multimedia ontologies.
1076129	A database centric view of semantic image annotation and retrieval We introduce a new model for semantic annotation and retrieval from image databases. The new model is based on a probabilistic formulation that poses annotation and retrieval as classification problems, and produces solutions that are optimal in the minimum probability of error sense. It is also database centric, by establishing a one-to-one mapping between semantic classes and the groups of database images that share the associated semantic labels. In this work we show that, under the database centric probabilistic model, optimal annotation and retrieval can be implemented with algorithms that are conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. Due to its simplicity, the annotation and retrieval architecture is also amenable to sophisticated parameter tuning, a property that is exploited to investigate the role of feature selection in the design of optimal annotation and retrieval systems. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of simply establishing a one-to-one mapping between keywords and the states of the semantic classification problem over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of keyword and visual feature distributions. The database centric probabilistic retrieval model is compared to existing semantic labeling and retrieval methods, and shown to achieve higher accuracy than the previously best published results, at a fraction of their computational cost.
1076131	Analysis of factoid questions for effective relation extraction We present an analysis of the structured relationships observed in a randomly sampled set of question-like queries submitted to a search engine for a popular online encyclopedic document collection. Our study shows that a relatively small number of binary relationships account for most of the queries in the sample. This empirically validates an approach of analyzing query logs to identify the relationships most relevant to user needs and populating corresponding fact tables from the collection for factoid question answering. Our analysis shows that such an approach can lead to substantial coverage of user questions.
1076132	A testbed for people searching strategies in the WWW This paper describes the creation of a testbed to evaluate people searching strategies on the World-Wide-Web. This task involves resolving person names' ambiguity and locating relevant information characterising every individual under the same name.
1076133	Measure-based metasearch We propose a simple method for converting many standard measures of retrieval performance into metasearch algorithms. Our focus is both on the analysis of retrieval measures themselves and on the development of new metasearch algorithms. Given the conversion method proposed, our experimental results using TREC data indicate that system-oriented measures of overall retrieval performance (such as average precision) yield good metasearch algorithms whose performance equals or exceeds that of benchmark techniques such as CombMNZ and Condorcet.
1076134	A geometric interpretation of r-precision and its correlation with average precision We consider two of the most commonly cited measures of retrieval performance: average precision and R-precision. It is well known that average precision and R-precision are highly correlated and similarly robust measures of performance, though the reasons for this are not entirely clear. In this paper, we give a geometric argument which shows that under a very reasonable set of assumptions, average precision and R-precision both approximate the area under the precision-recall curve, thus explaining their high correlation. We further demonstrate through the use of TREC data that the similarity or difference between average precision and R-precision is largely governed by the adherence to, or violation of, these reasonable assumptions.
1076135	Probabilistic hyperspace analogue to language Song and Bruza [6] introduce a framework for Information Retrieval(IR) based on Gardenfor's three tiered cognitive model; Conceptual Spaces[4]. They instantiate a conceptual space using Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL[3] to generate higher order concepts which are later used for ad-hoc retrieval. In this poster, we propose an alternative implementation of the conceptual space by using a probabilistic HAL space (pHAL). To evaluate whether converting to such an implementation is beneficial we have performed an initial investigation comparing the concept combination of HAL against pHAL for the task of query expansion. Our experiments indicate that pHAL outperforms the original HAL method and that better query term selection methods can improve performance on both HAL and pHAL.
1076136	Basic issues on the processing of web queries In this paper we study three basic and key issues related to Web query processing: load balance, broker behavior, and performance by individual index servers. Our study, while preliminary, does reveal interesting tradeoffs: (1) load unbalance at low query arrival rates can be controlled with a simple measure of randomizing the distribution of documents among the index servers, (2) the broker is not a bottleneck, and (3) disk utilization is higher than CPU utilization.
1076137	An interface to search human movements based on geographic and chronological metadata Historians and scholars can better understand historic events by studying the geographic and chronological activity of individuals who witnessed them. A lack of adequate tools to help users study these activities can hinder the process of learning and discovery. In this paper we present an interface to address this problem that contains three components: a map, a timeline, and a text representation of a survivor's movements. These components simultaneously provide query input (where users can specify their needs) and dynamic results display (where users can immediately see the effect of their decisions). The results of a pilot study show that users reacted positively to the interface.
1076138	Automatic web query classification using labeled and unlabeled training data Accurate topical categorization of user queries allows for increased effectiveness, efficiency, and revenue potential in general-purpose web search systems. Such categorization becomes critical if the system is to return results not just from a general web collection but from topic-specific databases as well. Maintaining sufficient categorization recall is very difficult as web queries are typically short, yielding few features per query. We examine three approaches to topical categorization of general web queries: matching against a list of manually labeled queries, supervised learning of classifiers, and mining of selectional preference rules from large unlabeled query logs. Each approach has its advantages in tackling the web query classification recall problem, and combining the three techniques allows us to classify a substantially larger proportion of queries than any of the individual techniques. We examine the performance of each approach on a real web query stream and show that our combined method accurately classifies 46% of queries, outperforming the recall of the best single approach by nearly 20%, with a 7% improvement in overall effectiveness.
1076139	Surrogate scoring for improved metasearch precision We describe a method for improving the precision of metasearch results based upon scoring the visual features of documents' surrogate representations. These surrogate scores are used during fusion in place of the original scores or ranks provided by the underlying search engines. Visual features are extracted from typical search result surrogate information, such as title, snippet, URL, and rank. This approach specifically avoids the use of search engine-specific scores and collection statistics that are required by most traditional fusion strategies. This restriction correctly reflects the use of metasearch in practice, in which knowledge of the underlying search engines' strategies cannot be assumed. We evaluate our approach using a precision-oriented test collection of manually-constructed binary relevance judgments for the top ten results from ten web search engines over 896 queries. We show that our visual fusion approach significantly outperforms the rCombMNZ fusion algorithm by 5.71%, with 99% confidence, and the best individual web search engine by 10.9%, with 99% confidence.
1076140	Detecting action-items in e-mail An abstract is not available.
1076141	Characterization of a simple case of the reassignment of document identifiers as a pattern sequencing problem In this poster, we analyze recent work in the document identifiers reassignment problem. After that, we present a formalization of a simple case of the problem as a PSP (Pattern Sequencing Problem). This may facilitate future work as it opens a new research line to solve the general problem.
1076142	Testing algorithms is like testing students In this paper, we apply methods from educational testing to measure the reliability of an IR collection.
1076143	Evaluating the impact of selection noise in community-based web search The I-SPY meta-search engine uses a technique called collaborative Web search to leverage the past search behaviour (queries and selections) of a community of users in order to promote search results that are relevant to the community. In this paper we describe recent studies to clarify the benefits of this approach in situations when the behaviour of users cannot be relied upon in terms of their ability to consistently select relevant results during search sessions.
1076144	Expectation of f-measures: tractable exact computation and some empirical observations of its properties We derive a tractable and exact computation for the expectation of F -measures. We also demonstrate the non-convexity of this expectation, and investigate errors of approximating the expectation under different settings.
1076145	Search engines and how students think they work To investigate the nature of people's understandings for how search engines work, we collected data from 232 undergraduate and graduate students. Students were asked to "draw a labeled sketch of how search engines work." A reference model was constructed and each sketch was analyzed and compared against it for completeness. The paper presents preliminary results and discusses the implications for educational assessment and curriculum design on the one hand, and information system design on the other.
1076146	On evaluation of adaptive topic tracking systems Summative evaluation methods for supervised adaptive topic tracking systems convolve the effect of system decisions on present utility with the effect on future utility. This paper describes a new formative evaluation approach that focuses on future utility for use in the design stage of adaptive systems. Topic model quality is assessed at a predefined set of points using a fixed document set to enhance comparability. Experiments using a vector-space topic tracking system illustrate the utility of this approach to formative evaluation.
1076147	Top subset retrieval on large collections using sorted indices In this poster we describe alternative inverted index structures that reduce the time required to process queries, produce a higher query throughput and still return high quality results to the end user. We give results based upon the TREC Terabyte dataset showing improvements that these indices give in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
1076148	Relation between PLSA and NMF and implications Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF, [5]) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA, [4]) have been successfully applied to a number of text analysis tasks such as document clustering. Despite their different inspirations, both methods are instances of multinomial PCA [1]. We further explore this relationship and first show that PLSA solves the problem of NMF with KL divergence, and then explore the implications of this relationship.
1076149	The impact of evaluation on multilingual text retrieval We summarize the impact of the first five years of activity of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) on multilingual text retrieval system performance and show how the CLEF evaluation campaigns have contributed to advances in the state-of-the-art.
1076150	Using Oracle® for natural language document retrieval an automatic query reformulation approach In corporate applications, vast amounts of data are often stored in database systems such as Oracle. Apart from structured information this can include text documents which cannot easily be retrieved using traditional SQL queries.Oracle includes means to deal with full text document retrieval (called Oracle Text) that offer special query operators for searches inside text fields. We have explored the effect of these different operators for queries derived from natural language queries. This article compares the retrieval performances achieved with different automatic reformulations from natural language to Oracle SQL queries.
1076151	Customizing information access according to domain and task knowledge: the ontoExplo system In this paper we present a system that allows a user to explore or mine a document collection. This system is based on domain and task knowledge modelled in the form of ontologies and allows direct access both to information as it is stored and to information that is built from it. The system has been developed in Java.
1076152	Evaluating semantic indexing techniques through cross-language fingerprinting Users in search of on-line document sources are usually looking for content, not words. Hence, IR researchers generally agree that search techniques should be geared toward the meaning underlying documents rather than toward the text itself. The most visible examples of such techniques are Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL). If these techniques really uncover semantic dependencies, then they should be applicable across languages. We investigated this using electronic versions of three kinds of translated material: a novel, a popular treatise about cosmology, and a data base of technical specifications. We used the analogy of fingerprinting used in forensics to establish if individuals are related. Genetic fingerprinting uses enzymes to split the DNA and then compare the resulting band patterns. Likewise, in our research we use queries to split a document into fragments. If a search technique really isolates fragments related to the query, then a document and its translation should have similar band patterns. In this paper we (1) present the fingerprinting technique, (2) introduce the material used, and (3) report preliminary results of an evaluation for two semantic indexing techniques.
1076153	Live visual relevance feedback for query formulation Users browsing the Internet seem relatively satisfied with the performance of search engines. An optimistic explanation would be the high quality of search engines. A more pessimistic one would be that people just adapt easily to any new technology. A third explanation is people's ignorance about recall: as they simply don't know what relevant documents are missed, they can hardly be expected to worry about them. And so they easily conceive the result as the best they can get. To allow the user to better assess the quality of the search results, an algorithm was developed that computes a visual representation of the document space in the neighborhood of the user's query.The paper (1) outlines the algorithm, (2) shows how users can explore the neighborhood of a query, and (3) demonstrates how users can guess more judiciously whether they need to further elaborate their query to improve retrieval results.
1076154	A dual index model for contextual information retrieval In this paper, we propose a dual index model for contextual IR. For each query, we search against both document level and passage level indexes, and use the corresponding merge function to update the weights for both documents and paragraphs by combining the results from both indexes according to the granularity information in metadata. Experiments on 2004 TREC data show that a significant improvement can be made by using the dual index model.
1076155	Predicting query difficulty on the web by learning visual clues We describe a method for predicting query difficulty in a precision-oriented web search task. Our approach uses visual features from retrieved surrogate document representations (titles, snippets, etc.) to predict retrieval effectiveness for a query. By training a supervised machine learning algorithm with manually evaluated queries, visual clues indicative of relevance are discovered. We show that this approach has a moderate correlation of 0.57 with precision at 10 scores from manual relevance judgments of the top ten documents retrieved by ten web search engines over 896 queries. Our findings indicate that difficulty predictors which have been successful in recall-oriented ad-hoc search, such as clarity metrics, are not nearly as correlated with engine performance in precision-oriented tasks such as this, yielding a maximum correlation of 0.3. Additionally, relying only on visual clues avoids the need for collection statistics that are required by these prior approaches. This enables our approach to be employed in environments where these statistics are unavailable or costly to retrieve, such as metasearch.
1076156	Finding semantically similar questions based on their answers A large number of question and answer pairs can be collected from question and answer boards and FAQ pages on the Web. This paper proposes an automatic method of finding the questions that have the same meaning. The method can detect semantically similar questions that have little word overlap because it calculates question-question similarities by using the corresponding answers as well as the questions. We develop two different similarity measures based on language modeling and compare them with the traditional similarity measures. Experimental results show that semantically similar questions pairs can be effectively found with the proposed similarity measures.
1076157	Study of cross lingual information retrieval using on-line translation systems Typical cross language retrieval requires special linguistic resources, such as bilingual dictionaries and parallel corpus. In this study, we focus on the cross lingual retrieval problem that only uses online translation systems. We compare two approaches: a translation-based approach that directly translates queries into the language of documents and then applies traditional information retrieval techniques; and a model-based approach that first learns a statistical translation model from the translations acquired from an online translation system and then applies the learned statistical model to cross lingual information retrieval. Our empirical study with ImageCLEF has shown the model-based approach performs significantly better than the translation-based approach.
1076158	3D viewpoint-based photo search and information browsing We propose a new photo search method that uses three-dimensional (3D) viewpoints as queries. 3D viewpoint-based image retrieval is especially useful for searching collections of archaeological photographs,which contain many different images of the same object. Our method is designed to enable users to retrieve images that contain the same object but show a different view, and to browse groups of images taken from a similar viewpoint. We also propose using 3D scenes to query by example, which means that users do not have the problem of trying to formulate appropriate queries. This combination gives users an easy way of accessing not only photographs but also archived information.
1076159	Examination and enhancement of a ring-structured graphical search interface based on usability testing We evaluated the interactive retrieval functionality of the Concentric Ring View according to a series of usability studies. This is a ring structure-based graphical user interface, like a planisphere, for image retrieval with multi-faceted metadata. Attribute values for each facet are arranged on a ring, and retrieved images are displayed inside using search keys derived from the attribute values on the bottom part of the rings. By rotating the rings, users can browse retrieved images while adjusting search keys. The first usability test conducted with thirty six participants confirmed that: (i) novice users, even junior high school students, could use this interface; (ii) users could find images better than anticipated; and (iii) the interface was good at choosing the first relevant image, but users could not refine retrieval because they were unable to reuse retrieved results. To solve this problem, we added two functionalities, personal history for reuse and relevance feedback. With these improvements, we named the new version of the interface Concentric Ring View F+ . A second usability test with seven participants confirmed the effectiveness of this newer interface.
1076160	Short comings of latent models in supervised settings The Aspect Model [1, 2] and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model [3, 4] are latent generative models proposed with the objective of modeling discrete data such as text. Though it is not explicitly published (to the best of our knowledge), it is reasonably well known in there search community that the Aspect Model does not perform very well in supervised settings and also that latent models are frequently not identifiable, i.e. their optimal parameters are not unique.In this paper, we make a much stronger claim about the pitfalls of commonly-used latent models. By constructing a small, synthetic, but by no means unrealistic corpus, we show that latent models have inherent limitations that prevent them from recovering semantically meaningful parameters from data generated from a reasonable generative distribution. In fact, our experiments with supervised classification using the Aspect Model, showed that its performance was rather poor, even worse than Naive Bayes, leading us to the synthetic study.We also analyze the scenario of using tempered EM and show that it would not plug the above shortcomings. Our analysis suggests that there is also some scope for improvement in the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model(LDA) [3, 4]. We then use our insight into the shortcomings of these models, to come up with a promising variant of the LDA, that does not suffer from the aforesaid drawbacks. This could potentially lead to much better performance and model fit, in the supervised scenario.
1076161	Major topic detection and its application to opinion summarization An abstract is not available.
1076162	Using query term order for result summarisation We report on two experiments performed to test the importance of Term Order in automatic summarisation. Experiment one was undertaken as part of DUC 2004 to which three systems were submitted, each with a different summarisation approach. The system that used document Term Order outperformed those that did not use Term Order in the ROUGE evaluation. Experiment two made use of human evaluations of search engine results, comparing our Query Term Order summaries with a simulation of current Google search engine result summaries in terms of summary quality. Our QTO system's summaries aided users' relevance judgements to a significantly greater extent than Google's.
1076163	Profile-based event tracking In this research, we focus on tracking topics that originate and evolve from a specific event. Intuitively, a few key elements of a target event, such as date, location, and persons involved, would be enough for making a decision on whether a test story is on-topic. Consequently, a profile-based event tracking method is proposed. We attempt to build an event profile from the given on-topic stories by robust information retrieval technologies. A feature selection metric and a recognized event clause are utilized to determine most (if not all) key semantic elements of the target event. Preliminary experiments on the TDT2 mandarin corpus show that this profile-based event tracking method is promising.

1076165	Assessing the term independence assumption in blind relevance feedback When applying blind relevance feedback for ad hoc document retrieval, is it possible to identify, a priori, the set of query terms that will most improve retrieval performance? Can this complex problem be reduced into the simpler one of making independent decisions about the performance effects of each query term? Our experiments suggest that, for the selection of terms for blind relevance feedback, the term independence assumption may be empirically justified.

1076167	Information sharing through rational links and viewpoint retrieval In this paper we present the concept of Federated Information Sharing Communities (FISC), which leverages organisational and social relationships with document content to provide community-centred information sharing and communication environments. Prominence is given to capabilities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness "in the large" to help users understand the members within community and the relationships between them. Within the FISC framework, we provide viewpoint retrieval to enable a user to construct member-specific view(s) of the community, based on their various topic interests. As proof of concept, we present the first FISC prototype based on the twenty-five year SIGIR collection and examples of operational results.
1076168	Mining multimedia salient concepts for incremental information extraction We propose a novel algorithm for extracting information by mining the feature space clusters and then assigning salient concepts to them. Bayesian techniques for extracting concepts from multimedia usually suffer either from lack of data or from too complex concepts to be represented by a single statistical model. An incremental information extraction approach, working at different levels of abstraction, would be able to handle concepts of varying complexities. We present the results of our research on the initial part of an incremental approach, the extraction of the most salient concepts from multimedia information.
1076169	Translating pieces of words Translation for cross-language information retrieval need not be word-based. We show that character n-grams in one language can be 'translated' into character n-grams of another language. We demonstrate that such translations produce retrieval results on par with, and often exceeding, those of word-based and stem-based translation.

1076171	A temporally adaptive content-based relevance ranking algorithm In information retrieval relevance ranking of the results is one of the most important single tasks there are. There are many diffierent ranking algorithms based on the content of the documents or on some external properties e.g. link structure of html documents.We present a temporally adaptive content-based relevance ranking algorithm that explicitly takes into account the temporal behavior of the underlying statistical properties of the documents in the form of a statistical topic model. more we state that our algorithm can be used on top of any ranking algorithm.
1076172	Automated evaluation of search engine performance via implicit user feedback Measuring the information retrieval effectiveness of Web search engines can be expensive if human relevance judgments are required to evaluate search results. Using implicit user feedback for search engine evaluation provides a cost and time effective manner of addressing this problem. Web search engines can use human evaluation of search results without the expense of human evaluators. An additional advantage of this approach is the availability of real time data regarding system performance. Wecapture user relevance judgments actions such as print, save and bookmark, sending these actions and the corresponding document identifiers to a central server via a client application. We use this implicit feedback to calculate performance metrics, such as precision. We can calculate an overall system performance metric based on a collection of weighted metrics.

1076174	Using dragpushing to refine centroid text classifiers We present a novel algorithm, DragPushing, for automatic text classification. Using a training data set, the algorithm first calculates the prototype vectors, or centroids, for each of the available document classes. Using misclassified examples, it then iteratively refines these centroids; by dragging the centroid of a correct class towards a misclassified example and in the same time pushing the centroid of an incorrect class away from the misclassified example. The algorithm is simple to implement and is computationally very efficient. Evaluation experiments conducted on two benchmark collections show that its classification accuracy is comparable to that of more complex methods, such as support vector machines (SVM).
1076175	Scalable hierarchical topic detection: exploring a sample based approach Hierarchical topic detection is a new task in the TDT 2004 evaluation program, which aims to organize an unstructured news collection in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, reflecting the topics discussed. We present a scalable architecture for HTD and compare several alternative choices for agglomerative clustering and DAG optimization in order to minimize the HTD cost metric.
1076176	Noun sense induction using web search results This paper presents an algorithm for unsupervised noun sense induction, based on clustering of Web search results. The algorithm does not utilize labeled training instances or any other external knowledge source. Preliminary results on a small dataset show that this technique provides two advantages over other techniques in the literature: it detects real-world senses not found in dictionaries or other lexical resources, and it does not require that the number of word senses be specified in advance.
1076177	Self-organizing distributed collaborative filtering We propose a fully decentralized collaborative filtering approach that is self-organizing and operates in a distributed way. The relevances between downloading files (items) are stored locally at these items in so called item-based buddy tables and are updated each time that the items are downloaded. We then propose to use the language model to build recommendations for the different users based on the buddy tables of those items a user has downloaded previously. We have tested and compared our distributed collaborative filtering approach to centralized collaborative filtering and showed that it has similar performance. It is therefore a promising technique to facilitate recommendations in peer-to-peer networks.
1076178	Dirichlet PageRank PageRank has been known to be a successful algorithm in ranking web sources. In order to avoid the rank sink problem, PageRank assumes that a surfer, being in a page, jumps to a random page with a certain probability. In the standard PageRank algorithm, the jumping probabilities are assumed to be the same for all the pages, regardless of the page properties. This is not the case in the real world, since presumably a surfer would more likely follow the out-links of a high-quality hub page than follow the links of a low-quality one. In this poster, we propose a novel algorithm "Dirichlet PageRank" to address this problem by adapting exible jumping probabilities based on the number of out-links in a page. Empirical results on TREC data show that our method outperforms the standard PageRank algorithm.
1076179	A retrospective study of probabilistic context-based retrieval We propose a novel probabilistic retrieval model which weights terms according to their contexts in documents. The term weighting function of our model is similar to the language model and the binary independence model. The retrospective experiments (i.e., relevance information is present) illustrate the potential of our probabilistic context-based retrieval where the precision at the top 30 documents is about 43% for TREC-6 data and 52% for TREC-7 data.
1076180	Indexing emails and email threads for retrieval Electronic mail poses a number of unusual challenges for the design of information retrieval systems and test collections, including informal expression, conversational structure, variable document granularity (e.g., messages, threads, or longer-term interactions), a naturally occuring integration between free text and structural metadata, and incompletely characterized user needs. This paper reports on initial experiments with a large collection of public mailing lists from the World Wide Web consortium that will be used for the TREC 2005 Enterprise Search Track. Automatic subject-line threading and removal of duplicated text were found to have little effect in a small pilot study. Those observations motivated development of a question typology and more detailed analysis of collection characteristics; preliminary results for both are reported.
1076181	Intelligent fusion of structural and citation-based evidence for text classification This paper shows how different measures of similarity derived from the citation information and the structural content (e.g., title, abstract) of the collection can be fused to improve classification effectiveness. To discover the best fusion framework, we apply Genetic Programming (GP) techniques. Our experiments with the ACM Computing Classification Scheme, using documents from the ACM Digital Library, indicate that GP can discover similarity functions superior to those based solely on a single type of evidence. Effectiveness of the similarity functions discovered through simple majority voting is better than that of content-based as well as combination-based Support Vector Machine classifiers. Experiments also were conducted to compare the performance between GP techniques and other fusion techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and linear fusion. Empirical results show that GP was able to discover better similarity functions than other fusion techniques.
1076182	Mining translations of OOV terms from the web through cross-lingual query expansion Translating out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms is a great challenge for the Cross-lingual Information Retrieval and Data-driven Machine Translation systems. Several approaches have been proposed to mine translations for OOV terms from the web, especially from pages containing mixed languages. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically translate OOV terms on the fly through cross-lingual query expansion. The proposed approach does not require any web crawling and has achieved an inclusion rate of 95% and overall translation accuracy of 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art OOV translation techniques.

1076189	A wireless natural language search engine Web search using stationary (desktop) computers has become a pervasive activity. The mobile user in need of information, however, faces several problems in his or her quest to satisfy an information need. Mobile devices have small displays, and mobile user interfaces are often less then usable, because they impose the desktop Web search paradigm on the mobile user. We present a wireless search engine based on natural language queries transmitted via popular Small Message Service (SMS) text messages. Besides traditional keyword based queries, the system can accept questions or phrases and returns responses that contain likely answers (Figure 1) instead of traditional lists of hyperlinks. The additional precision gained from performing a linguistic analysis of the query helps extracting answers from Web pages directly, which requires no navigation. The system is implemented using a NLIR system residing on a server, which can translate questions or phrases into search engine queries or queries to SOAP Web services, where a gateway mediates between the mobile network and the Internet (Figure 2). Whereas on the desktop keyboard-based search still prevails, we find that in a mobile context question answering techniques can help overcome the output constraints.

1148171	Quantum haystacks This acceptance talk is a curious mixture of personal history and developing ideas in the context of the growing field of IR covering several decades. I want to concentrate on models and theories, interpreted loosely, and try and give an insight into where I have got to in my thinking, where the ideas came from, and where I believe we are going.In the last few years I have been working on the development of what might be coined as a design language for IR. It takes its inspiration from Quantum Mechanics, but by analogy only. The mathematical objects represent documents; these objects might be vectors (or density operators) in an n-dimensional vector space (usually a Hilbert space). A request for information, or a query, is taken as an observable and is represented as a linear operator on the space. Linear operators can be expressed as matrices. Such an operator, Hermitian, has a set of eigenvectors forming a basis for the space; which we interpret as a point of view or perspective from which to understand the space. Thus any document-vector can be located with respect to the basis, and we can calculate an inner product between such a vector and any basis vector, which may be interpreted as a probability of relevance. The probability of observing any given eigenvector is now given by the square of that inner product assuming all vectors are normalised. Hence we connect the probability of observation to the geometry of the space. Furthermore, the subspaces of the space make up a lattice structure which is equivalent to a logic. This makes up the entire mathematical structure, and the language for handling this structure is linear algebra: vectors, matrices, projections, inner-products, neatly captured by the Dirac notation used in quantum mechanics. Our probability is slightly different from classical probability, the same for logic; we end up with quantum logic and quantum probability.A commitment to this kind of mathematical structure, with which to model objects and processes in IR, depends on two critical assumptions. The distances in the space between objects are a source of important relationships with respect to relevance and aboutness. The observation of a property such as relevance or aboutness is user dependent in the sense that a potential interaction is specified by a user through an operator which when measured achieves outcomes with a probability determined by the geometry of the space. .The geometry of this mathematical structure and the probability defined on it are closely connected by the following theorem due to Gleason (1957). One may summarise this theorem by saying that the probability of a subspace is given by a simple algorithm derived from a projection onto the subspace and a special kind of operator, namely a statistical operator, or density matrix. And conversely, that given a probability measure on the subspaces then we can encode that measure uniquely through such an algorithm. This is a very powerful theorem and its consequences remain to be explored.So how did I get to this point and form of abstraction? Most of my research work can be divided into contributions to the following areas: Clustering Evaluation Probabilistic Models Logic Models Geometry .In all these areas I have attempted to search for underlying mathematical structures that would lead to computations. These topics have in common that they depend on the construction of measures on a space which in some sense determines the usefulness or effectiveness of the structure. For clustering one considers mapping from metric spaces to ultrametic spaces and measure the closeness of fit. In the case of evaluation, one starts with a relational conjoint structure and imposes some constraints given by what is to be measured, one then constructs a numerical representation of this structure leading to such measures as F (or E). For probabilistic models the main difficulty is concerned with deciding on an appropriate event space on which to define the 'right' probability measures. For me the most significant example in this context was the attempt to construct a Logical Uncertainty Principle which formulated a measure of uncertainty on incomplete logical constructs. This attempt left unspecified the exact form of the measure. In the Geometry of IR I finally managed to formulate that measure as a projection-valued measure.This way of thinking did not appear out of nowhere. It was heavily influenced by the work of Fairthorne(1961) whose work on Brouwerian Logic (an Intuitionistic Logic) was picked up by Salton in his early book on IR. At an earlier stage MacKay (1950) wrote a paper that opened with, 'This paper relates to the borderline linking experimental and theoretical physics with mathematical logic, and covers at several points ground which is common to the theory of communication.' He goes on to define an 'information-operator' which is very similar in scope and intent to the Hermitian operator above. Maron, who collaborated with MacKay, stated in his 1965 paper, 'Therefore, it can be argued that index descriptions should not be viewed as properties of documents: They function to relate documents and users.' One can see that the development of these early ideas was continued to the construction of the Geometry of IR.What does it leave to be done? An attempt should be made to use this design language to build an IR system. On the theoretical front it is worth considering whether it would be better to start with a transition probability space rather than a Hilbert space as Von Neumann did in 1937 (translated in 1981). The assumption that closed linear subspaces will be the elements of our logic can be challenged, as perhaps a construction with different elements is possible. It is not obvious what the best form of conditional probability might be in these spaces. Agreeing on a form of conditionalisation is intimately tied up with how to model contextuality. There is some evidence to suggest that contextuality plays a role in modelling the conjuncton of concepts (Widdows, 2004). Such contexts have been modelled in quantum theory almost from the beginning, for example, Gleason's theorem precludes noncontextual hidden variable theories.
1148172	Social networks, incentives, and search The role of network structure has grown in significance over the past ten years in the field of information retrieval, stimulated to a great extent by the importance of link analysis in the development of Web search techniques [4]. This body of work has focused primarily on the network that is most clearly visible on the Web: the network of hyperlinks connecting documents to documents. But the Web has always contained a second network, less explicit but equally important, and this is the social network on its users, with latent person-to-person links encoding a variety of relationships including friendship, information exchange, and influence. Developments over the past few years --- including the emergence of social networking systems and rich social media, as well as the availability of large-scale e-mail and instant messenging datasets --- have highlighted the crucial role played by on-line social networks, and at the same time have made them much easier to uncover and analyze. There is now a considerable opportunity to exploit the information content inherent in these networks, and this prospect raises a number of interesting research challenge.Within this context, we focus on some recent efforts to formalize the problem of searching a social network. The goal is to capture the issues underlying a variety of related scenarios: a member of a social networking system such as MySpace seeks a piece of information that may be held by a friend of a friend [27, 28]; an employee in a large company searches his or her network of colleagues for expertise in a particular subject [9]; a node in a decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries for a file that is likely to be a small number of hops away [2, 6, 16, 17]; or a user in a distributed IR or federated search setting traverses a network of distributed resources connected by links that may not just be informational but also economic or contractual [3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 18, 21]. In their most basic forms, these scenarios have some essential features in common: a node in a network, without global knowledge, must find a short path to a desired "target" node (or to one of several possible target nodes).To frame the underlying problem, we go back to one of the most well-known pieces of empirical social network analysis --- Stanley Milgram's research into the small-world phenomenon, also known as the "six degrees of separation" [19, 24, 25]. The form of Milgram's experiments, in which randomly chosen starters had to forward a letter to a designated target individual, established not just that short chains connecting far-flung pairs of people are abundant in large social networks, but also that the individuals in these networks, operating with purely local information about their own friends and acquaintances, are able to actually find these chains [10]. The Milgram experiments thus constituted perhaps the earliest indication that large-scale social networks are structured to support this type of decentralized search. Within a family of random-graph models proposed by Watts and Strogatz [26], we have shown that the ability of a network to support this type of decentralized search depends in subtle ways on how its "long-range" connections are correlated with the underlying spatial or organizational structure in which it is embedded [10, 11]. Recent studies using data on communication within organizations [1] and the friendships within large on-line communities [15] have established the striking fact that real social networks closely match some of the structural features predicted by these mathematical models.If one looks further at the on-line settings that provide the initial motivation for these issues, there is clearly interest from many directions in their long-term economic implications --- essentially, the consequences that follow from viewing distributed information retrieval applications, peer-to-peer systems, or social-networking sites as providing marketplaces for information and services. How does the problem of decentralized search in a network change when the participants are not simply agents following a fixed algorithm, but strategic actors who make decisions in their own self-interest, and may demand compensation for taking part in a protocol? Such considerations bring us into the realm of algorithmic game theory, an active area of current research that uses game-theoretic notions to quantify the performance of systems in which the participants follow their own self-interest [20, 23] In a simple model for decentralized search in the presence of incentives, we find that performance depends crucially on both the rarity of the information and the richness of the network topology [12] --- if the network is too structurally impoverished, an enormous investment may be required to produce a path from a query to an answer.

1148175	Learning user interaction models for predicting web search result preferences Evaluating user preferences of web search results is crucial for search engine development, deployment, and maintenance. We present a real-world study of modeling the behavior of web search users to predict web search result preferences. Accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking, click spam detection, web search personalization, and other tasks. Our key insight to improving robustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from the expected "noisy" user behavior. We show that our model of clickthrough interpretation improves prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art clickthrough methods. We generalize our approach to model user behavior beyond clickthrough, which results in higher preference prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone. We report results of a large-scale experimental evaluation that show substantial improvements over published implicit feedback interpretation methods.
1148176	User performance versus precision measures for simple search tasks Several recent studies have demonstrated that the type of improvements in information retrieval system effectiveness reported in forums such as SIGIR and TREC do not translate into a benefit for users. Two of the studies used an instance recall task, and a third used a question answering task, so perhaps it is unsurprising that the precision based measures of IR system effectiveness on one-shot query evaluation do not correlate with user performance on these tasks. In this study, we evaluate two different information retrieval tasks on TREC Web-track data: a precision-based user task, measured by the length of time that users need to find a single document that is relevant to a TREC topic; and, a simple recall-based task, represented by the total number of relevant documents that users can identify within five minutes. Users employ search engines with controlled mean average precision (MAP) of between 55% and 95%. Our results show that there is no significant relationship between system effectiveness measured by MAP and the precision-based task. A significant, but weak relationship is present for the precision at one document returned metric. A weak relationship is present between MAP and the simple recall-based task.
1148177	Improving web search ranking by incorporating user behavior information We show that incorporating user behavior data can significantly improve ordering of top results in real web search setting. We examine alternatives for incorporating feedback into the ranking process and explore the contributions of user feedback compared to other common web search features. We report results of a large scale evaluation over 3,000 queries and 12 million user interactions with a popular web search engine. We show that incorporating implicit feedback can augment other features, improving the accuracy of a competitive web search ranking algorithms by as much as 31% relative to the original performance.
1148179	Contextual search and name disambiguation in email using graphs Similarity measures for text have historically been an important tool for solving information retrieval problems. In many interesting settings, however, documents are often closely connected to other documents, as well as other non-textual objects: for instance, email messages are connected to other messages via header information. In this paper we consider extended similarity metrics for documents and other objects embedded in graphs, facilitated via a lazy graph walk. We provide a detailed instantiation of this framework for email data, where content, social networks and a timeline are integrated in a structural graph. The suggested framework is evaluated for two email-related problems: disambiguating names in email documents, and threading. We show that reranking schemes based on the graph-walk similarity measures often outperform baseline methods, and that further improvements can be obtained by use of appropriate learning methods.
1148180	Thread detection in dynamic text message streams Text message stream is a newly emerging type of Web data which is produced in enormous quantities with the popularity of Instant Messaging and Internet Relay Chat. It is beneficial for detecting the threads contained in the text stream for various applications, including information retrieval, expert recognition and even crime prevention. Despite its importance, not much research has been conducted so far on this problem due to the characteristics of the data in which the messages are usually very short and incomplete. In this paper, we present a stringent definition of the thread detection task and our preliminary solution to it. We propose three variations of a single-pass clustering algorithm for exploiting the temporal information in the streams. An algorithm based on linguistic features is also put forward to exploit the discourse structure information. We conducted several experiments to compare our approaches with some existing algorithms on a real dataset. The results show that all three variations of the single-pass algorithm outperform the basic single-pass algorithm. Our proposed algorithm based on linguistic features improves the performance relatively by 69.5% and 9.7% when compared with the basic single-pass algorithm and the best variation algorithm in terms of F1 respectively.
1148181	Formal models for expert finding in enterprise corpora Searching an organization's document repositories for experts provides a cost effective solution for the task of expert finding. We present two general strategies to expert searching given a document collection which are formalized using generative probabilistic models. The first of these directly models an expert's knowledge based on the documents that they are associated with, whilst the second locates documents on topic, and then finds the associated expert. Forming reliable associations is crucial to the performance of expert finding systems. Consequently, in our evaluation we compare the different approaches, exploring a variety of associations along with other operational parameters (such as topicality). Using the TREC Enterprise corpora, we show that the second strategy consistently outperforms the first. A comparison against other unsupervised techniques, reveals that our second model delivers excellent performance.
1148183	Spoken document retrieval from call-center conversations We are interested in retrieving information from conversational speech corpora, such as call-center data. This data comprises spontaneous speech conversations with low recording quality, which makes automatic speech recognition (ASR) a highly difficult task. For typical call-center data, even state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems produce a transcript with word error rate of 30% or higher. In addition to the output transcript, advanced systems provide word confusion networks (WCNs), a compact representation of word lattices associating each word hypothesis with its posterior probability. Our work exploits the information provided by WCNs in order to improve retrieval performance. In this paper, we show that the mean average precision (MAP) is improved using WCNs compared to the raw word transcripts. Finally, we analyze the effect of increasing ASR word error rate on search effectiveness. We show that MAP is still reasonable even under extremely high error rate.
1148184	Towards efficient automated singer identification in large music databases Automated singer identification is important in organising, browsing and retrieving data in large music databases. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called H ybrid S inger I dentifier (HSI), for automated singer recognition. HSI can effectively use multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal and non-vocal music segments to enhance the identification process with a hybrid architecture and build profiles of individual singer characteristics based on statistical mixture models. Extensive experimental results conducted on a large music database demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.
1148185	Music structure based vector space retrieval This paper proposes a novel framework for music content indexing and retrieval. The music structure information, i.e., timing, harmony and music region content, is represented by the layers of the music structure pyramid. We begin by extracting this layered structure information. We analyze the rhythm of the music and then segment the signal proportional to the inter-beat intervals. Thus, the timing information is incorporated in the segmentation process, which we call Beat Space Segmentation . To describe Harmony Events , we propose a two-layer hierarchical approach to model the music chords. We also model the progression of instrumental and vocal content as Acoustic Events . After information extraction, we propose a vector space modeling approach which uses these events as the indexing terms. In query-by-example music retrieval, a query is represented by a vector of the statistics of the n -gram events. We then propose two effective retrieval models, a hard-indexing scheme and a soft-indexing scheme. Experiments show that the vector space modeling is effective in representing the layered music information, achieving 82.5% top-5 retrieval accuracy using 15-sec music clips as the queries. The soft-indexing outperforms hard-indexing in general.
1148187	AggregateRank: bringing order to web sites Since the website is one of the most important organizational structures of the Web, how to effectively rank websites has been essential to many Web applications, such as Web search and crawling. In order to get the ranks of websites, researchers used to describe the inter-connectivity among websites with a so-called HostGraph in which the nodes denote websites and the edges denote linkages between websites (if and only if there are hyperlinks from the pages in one website to the pages in the other, there will be an edge between these two websites), and then adopted the random walk model in the HostGraph. However, as pointed in this paper, the random walk over such a HostGraph is not reasonable because it is not in accordance with the browsing behavior of web surfers. Therefore, the derivate rank cannot represent the true probability of visiting the corresponding website.In this work, we mathematically proved that the probability of visiting a website by the random web surfer should be equal to the sum of the PageRank values of the pages inside that website. Nevertheless, since the number of web pages is much larger than that of websites, it is not feasible to base the calculation of the ranks of websites on the calculation of PageRank. To tackle this problem, we proposed a novel method named AggregateRank rooted in the theory of stochastic complement, which cannot only approximate the sum of PageRank accurately, but also have a lower computational complexity than PageRank. Both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation show that AggregateRank is a better method for ranking websites than previous methods.
1148188	Respect my authority!: HITS without hyperlinks, utilizing cluster-based language models We present an approach to improving the precision of an initial document ranking wherein we utilize cluster information within a graph-based framework. The main idea is to perform reranking based on centrality within bipartite graphs of documents (on one side) and clusters (on the other side), on the premise that these are mutually reinforcing entities. Links between entities are created via consideration of language models induced from them.We find that our cluster-document graphs give rise to much better retrieval performance than previously proposed document-only graphs do. For example, authority-based reranking of documents via a HITS-style cluster-based approach outperforms a previously-proposed PageRank-inspired algorithm applied to solely-document graphs. Moreover, we also show that computing authority scores for clusters constitutes an effective method for identifying clusters containing a large percentage of relevant documents.
1148189	Topical link analysis for web search Traditional web link-based ranking schemes use a single score to measure a page's authority without concern of the community from which that authority is derived. As a result, a resource that is highly popular for one topic may dominate the results of another topic in which it is less authoritative. To address this problem, we suggest calculating a score vector for each page to distinguish the contribution from different topics, using a random walk model that probabilistically combines page topic distribution and link structure. We show how to incorporate the topical model within both PageRank and HITS without affecting the overall property and still render insight into topic-level transition. Experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our technique outperforms other ranking approaches that incorporate textual analysis.
1148191	The role of knowledge in conceptual retrieval: a study in the domain of clinical medicine Despite its intuitive appeal, the hypothesis that retrieval at the level of "concepts" should outperform purely term-based approaches remains unverified empirically. In addition, the use of "knowledge" has not consistently resulted in performance gains. After identifying possible reasons for previous negative results, we present a novel framework for "conceptual retrieval" that articulates the types of knowledge that are important for information seeking. We instantiate this general framework in the domain of clinical medicine based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Experiments show that an EBM-based scoring algorithm dramatically outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline that employs only term statistics. Ablation studies further yield a better understanding of the performance contributions of different components. Finally, we discuss how other domains can benefit from knowledge-based approaches.
1148192	A parallel derivation of probabilistic information retrieval models This paper investigates in a stringent athematical formalism the parallel derivation of three grand probabilistic retrieval models: binary independent retrieval (BIR), Poisson model (PM), and language modelling (LM).The investigation has been motivated by a number of questions. Firstly, though sharing the same origin, namely the probability of relevance, the models differ with respect to event spaces. How can this be captured in a consistent notation, and can we relate the event spaces? Secondly, BIR and PM are closely related, but how does LM fit in? Thirdly, how are tf-idf and probabilistic models related? .The parallel investigation of the models leads to a number of formalised results: BIR and PM assume the collection to be a set of non-relevant documents, whereas LM assumes the collection to be a set of terms from relevant documents. PM can be viewed as a bridge connecting BIR and LM. A BIR-LM equivalence explains BIR as a special LM case. PM explains tf-idf, and both, BIR and LM probabilities express tf-idf in a dual way. .
1148193	Semantic term matching in axiomatic approaches to information retrieval A common limitation of many retrieval models, including the recently proposed axiomatic approaches, is that retrieval scores are solely based on exact (i.e., syntactic) matching of terms in the queries and documents, without allowing distinct but semantically related terms to match each other and contribute to the retrieval score. In this paper, we show that semantic term matching can be naturally incorporated into the axiomatic retrieval model through defining the primitive weighting function based on a semantic similarity function of terms. We define several desirable retrieval constraints for semantic term matching and use such constraints to extend the axiomatic model to directly support semantic term matching based on the mutual information of terms computed on some document set. We show that such extension can be efficiently implemented as query expansion. Experiment results on several representative data sets show that, with mutual information computed over the documents in either the target collection for retrieval or an external collection such as the Web, our semantic expansion consistently and substantially improves retrieval accuracy over the baseline axiomatic retrieval model. As a pseudo feedback method, our method also outperforms a state-of-the-art language modeling feedback method.
1148195	On-line spam filter fusion We show that a set of independently developed spam filters may be combined in simple ways to provide substantially better filtering than any of the individual filters. The results of fifty-three spam filters evaluated at the TREC 2005 Spam Track were combined post-hoc so as to simulate the parallel on-line operation of the filters. The combined results were evaluated using the TREC methodology, yielding more than a factor of two improvement over the best filter. The simplest method -- averaging the binary classifications returned by the individual filters -- yields a remarkably good result. A new method -- averaging log-odds estimates based on the scores returned by the individual filters -- yields a somewhat better result, and provides input to SVM- and logistic-regression-based stacking methods. The stacking methods appear to provide further improvement, but only for very large corpora. Of the stacking methods, logistic regression yields the better result. Finally, we show that it is possible to select a priori small subsets of the filters that, when combined, still outperform the best individual filter by a substantial margin.
1148196	Building bridges for web query classification Web query classification (QC) aims to classify Web users' queries, which are often short and ambiguous, into a set of target categories. QC has many applications including page ranking in Web search, targeted advertisement in response to queries, and personalization. In this paper, we present a novel approach for QC that outperforms the winning solution of the ACM KDDCUP 2005 competition, whose objective is to classify 800,000 real user queries. In our approach, we first build a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode. This classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy. A major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy, we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories, and therefore the bridging classifier needs to be trained only once. In addition, we introduce category selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries. Category selection can improve both efficiency and effectiveness of the online classification. By combining our algorithm with the winning solution of KDDCUP 2005, we made an improvement by 9.7% and 3.8% in terms of precision and F1 respectively compared with the best results of KDDCUP 2005.
1148197	ProbFuse: a probabilistic approach to data fusion Data fusion is the combination of the results of independent searches on a document collection into one single output result set. It has been shown in the past that this can greatly improve retrieval effectiveness over that of the individual results.This paper presents probFuse , a probabilistic approach to data fusion. ProbFuse assumes that the performance of the individual input systems on a number of training queries is indicative of their future performance. The fused result set is based on probabilities of relevance calculated during this training process. Retrieval experiments using data from the TREC ad hoc collection demonstrate that probFuse achieves results superior to that of the popular CombMNZ fusion algorithm.
1148199	Using web-graph distance for relevance feedback in web search We study the effect of user supplied relevance feedback in improving web search results. Rather than using query refinement or document similarity measures to rerank results, we show that the web-graph distance between two documents is a robust measure of their relative relevancy. We demonstrate how the use of this metric can improve the rankings of result URLs, even when the user only rates one document in the dataset. Our research suggests that such interactive systems can significantly improve search results.
1148200	Improving the estimation of relevance models using large external corpora Information retrieval algorithms leverage various collection statistics to improve performance. Because these statistics are often computed on a relatively small evaluation corpus, we believe using larger, non-evaluation corpora should improve performance. Specifically, we advocate incorporating external corpora based on language modeling. We refer to this process as external expansion . When compared to traditional pseudo-relevance feedback techniques, external expansion is more stable across topics and up to 10% more effective in terms of mean average precision. Our results show that using a high quality corpus that is comparable to the evaluation corpus can be as, if not more, effective than using the web. Our results also show that external expansion outperforms simulated relevance feedback. In addition, we propose a method for predicting the extent to which external expansion will improve retrieval performance. Our new measure demonstrates positive correlation with improvements in mean average precision.
1148201	Regularized estimation of mixture models for robust pseudo-relevance feedback Pseudo-relevance feedback has proven to be an effective strategy for improving retrieval accuracy in all retrieval models. However the performance of existing pseudo feedback methods is often affected significantly by some parameters, such as the number of feedback documents to use and the relative weight of original query terms; these parameters generally have to be set by trial-and-error without any guidance. In this paper, we present a more robust method for pseudo feedback based on statistical language models. Our main idea is to integrate the original query with feedback documents in a single probabilistic mixture model and regularize the estimation of the language model parameters in the model so that the information in the feedback documents can be gradually added to the original query. Unlike most existing feedback methods, our new method has no parameter to tune. Experiment results on two representative data sets show that the new method is significantly more robust than a state-of-the-art baseline language modeling approach for feedback with comparable or better retrieval accuracy.
1148203	Context-sensitive semantic smoothing for the language modeling approach to genomic IR Semantic smoothing, which incorporates synonym and sense information into the language models, is effective and potentially significant to improve retrieval performance. The implemented semantic smoothing models, such as the translation model which statistically maps document terms to query terms, and a number of works that have followed have shown good experimental results. However, these models are unable to incorporate contextual information. Thus, the resulting translation might be mixed and fairly general. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic smoothing method that decomposes a document or a query into a set of weighted context-sensitive topic signatures and then translate those topic signatures into query terms. In detail, we solve this problem through (1) choosing concept pairs as topic signatures and adopting an ontology-based approach to extract concept pairs; (2) estimating the translation model for each topic signature using the EM algorithm; and (3) expanding document and query models based on topic signature translations. The new smoothing method is evaluated on TREC 2004/05 Genomics Track collections and significant improvements are obtained. The MAP (mean average precision) achieves a 33.6% maximal gain over the simple language model, as well as a 7.8% gain over the language model with context-insensitive semantic smoothing.
1148204	LDA-based document models for ad-hoc retrieval Search algorithms incorporating some form of topic model have a long history in information retrieval. For example, cluster-based retrieval has been studied since the 60s and has recently produced good results in the language model framework. An approach to building topic models based on a formal generative model of documents, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is heavily cited in the machine learning literature, but its feasibility and effectiveness in information retrieval is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study how to efficiently use LDA to improve ad-hoc retrieval. We propose an LDA-based document model within the language modeling framework, and evaluate it on several TREC collections. Gibbs sampling is employed to conduct approximate inference in LDA and the computational complexity is analyzed. We show that improvements over retrieval using cluster-based models can be obtained with reasonable efficiency.
1148205	Adapting ranking SVM to document retrieval The paper is concerned with applying learning to rank to document retrieval. Ranking SVM is a typical method of learning to rank. We point out that there are two factors one must consider when applying Ranking SVM, in general a "learning to rank" method, to document retrieval. First, correctly ranking documents on the top of the result list is crucial for an Information Retrieval system. One must conduct training in a way that such ranked results are accurate. Second, the number of relevant documents can vary from query to query. One must avoid training a model biased toward queries with a large number of relevant documents. Previously, when existing methods that include Ranking SVM were applied to document retrieval, none of the two factors was taken into consideration. We show it is possible to make modifications in conventional Ranking SVM, so it can be better used for document retrieval. Specifically, we modify the "Hinge Loss" function in Ranking SVM to deal with the problems described above. We employ two methods to conduct optimization on the loss function: gradient descent and quadratic programming. Experimental results show that our method, referred to as Ranking SVM for IR, can outperform the conventional Ranking SVM and other existing methods for document retrieval on two datasets.
1148207	A study of statistical models for query translation: finding a good unit of translation This paper presents a study of three statistical query translation models that use different units of translation. We begin with a review of a word-based translation model that uses co-occurrence statistics for resolving translation ambiguities. The translation selection problem is then formulated under the framework of graphic model resorting to which the modeling assumptions and limitations of the co-occurrence model are discussed, and the research of finding better translation units is motivated. Then, two other models that use larger, linguistically motivated translation units (i.e., noun phrase and dependency triple) are presented. For each model, the modeling and training methods are described in detail. All query translation models are evaluated using TREC collections. Results show that larger translation units lead to more specific models that usually achieve better translation and cross-language information retrieval results.
1148208	Combining bidirectional translation and synonymy for cross-language information retrieval This paper introduces a general framework for the use of translation probabilities in cross-language information retrieval based on the notion that information retrieval fundamentally requires matching what the searcher means with what the author of a document meant. That perspective yields a computational formulation that provides a natural way of combining what have been known as query and document translation. Two well-recognized techniques are shown to be a special case of this model under restrictive assumptions. Cross-language search results are reported that are statistically indistinguishable from strong monolingual baselines for both French and Chinese documents.
1148210	Probabilistic model for definitional question answering This paper proposes a probabilistic model for definitional question answering (QA) that reflects the characteristics of the definitional question. The intention of the definitional question is to request the definition about the question target. Therefore, an answer for the definitional question should contain the content relevant to the topic of the target, and have a representation form of the definition style. Modeling the problem of definitional QA from both the topic and definition viewpoints, the proposed probabilistic model converts the task of answering the definitional questions into that of estimating the three language models: topic language model, definition language model, and general language model. The proposed model systematically combines several evidences in a probabilistic framework. Experimental results show that a definitional QA system based on the proposed probabilistic model is comparable to state-of-the-art systems.
1148211	Answering complex questions with random walk models We present a novel framework for answering complex questions that relies on question decomposition. Complex questions are decomposed by a procedure that operates on a Markov chain, by following a random walk on a bipartite graph of relations established between concepts related to the topic of a complex question and subquestions derived from topic-relevant passages that manifest these relations. Decomposed questions discovered during this random walk are then submitted to a state-of-the-art Question Answering (Q/A) system in order to retrieve a set of passages that can later be merged into a comprehensive answer by a Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) system. In our evaluations, we show that access to the decompositions generated using this method can significantly enhance the relevance and comprehensiveness of summary-length answers to complex questions.
1148212	A framework to predict the quality of answers with non-textual features New types of document collections are being developed by various web services. The service providers keep track of non-textual features such as click counts. In this paper, we present a framework to use non-textual features to predict the quality of documents. We also show our quality measure can be successfully incorporated into the language modeling-based retrieval model. We test our approach on a collection of question and answer pairs gathered from a community based question answering service where people ask and answer questions. Experimental results using our quality measure show a significant improvement over our baseline.
1148214	Latent semantic analysis for multiple-type interrelated data objects Co-occurrence data is quite common in many real applications. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has been successfully used to identify semantic relations in such data. However, LSA can only handle a single co-occurrence relationship between two types of objects. In practical applications, there are many cases where multiple types of objects exist and any pair of these objects could have a pairwise co-occurrence relation. All these co-occurrence relations can be exploited to alleviate data sparseness or to represent objects more meaningfully. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, M-LSA , which conducts latent semantic analysis by incorporating all pairwise co-occurrences among multiple types of objects. Based on the mutual reinforcement principle, M-LSA identifies the most salient concepts among the co-occurrence data and represents all the objects in a unified semantic space. M-LSA is general and we show that several variants of LSA are special cases of our algorithm. Experiment results show that M-LSA outperforms LSA on multiple applications, including collaborative filtering, text clustering, and text categorization.
1148215	Identifying comparative sentences in text documents This paper studies the problem of identifying comparative sentences in text documents. The problem is related to but quite different from sentiment/opinion sentence identification or classification. Sentiment classification studies the problem of classifying a document or a sentence based on the subjective opinion of the author. An important application area of sentiment/opinion identification is business intelligence as a product manufacturer always wants to know consumers' opinions on its products. Comparisons on the other hand can be subjective or objective. Furthermore, a comparison is not concerned with an object in isolation. Instead, it compares the object with others. An example opinion sentence is "the sound quality of CD player X is poor" . An example comparative sentence is "the sound quality of CD player X is not as good as that of CD player Y" . Clearly, these two sentences give different information. Their language constructs are quite different too. Identifying comparative sentences is also useful in practice because direct comparisons are perhaps one of the most convincing ways of evaluation, which may even be more important than opinions on each individual object. This paper proposes to study the comparative sentence identification problem. It first categorizes comparative sentences into different types, and then presents a novel integrated pattern discovery and supervised learning approach to identifying comparative sentences from text documents. Experiment results using three types of documents, news articles, consumer reviews of products, and Internet forum postings, show a precision of 79% and recall of 81%. More detailed results are given in the paper.
1148216	Tackling concept drift by temporal inductive transfer Machine learning is the mainstay for text classification. However, even the most successful techniques are defeated by many real-world applications that have a strong time-varying component. To advance research on this challenging but important problem, we promote a natural, experimental framework-the Daily Classification Task-which can be applied to large time-based datasets, such as Reuters RCV1.In this paper we dissect concept drift into three main subtypes. We demonstrate via a novel visualization that the recurrent themes subtype is present in RCV1. This understanding led us to develop a new learning model that transfers induced knowledge through time to benefit future classifier learning tasks. The method avoids two main problems with existing work in inductive transfer: scalability and the risk of negative transfer. In empirical tests, it consistently showed more than 10 points F-measure improvement for each of four Reuters categories tested.
1148218	Evaluation in (XML) information retrieval: expected precision-recall with user modelling (EPRUM) Standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics assume a simple model where documents are understood as independent units. Such an assumption is not adapted to new paradigms like XML or Web IR where retrievable informations are parts of documents or sets of related documents. Moreover, classical hypotheses assumes that the user ignores the structural or logical context of document elements and hence the possibility of navigation between units. EPRUM is a generalisation of Precision-Recall (PR) that aims at allowing the user to navigate or browse in the corpus structure. Like the Cumulated Gain metrics, it is able to handle continuous valued relevance. We apply and compare EPRUM in the context of XML Retrieval -- a very active field for evaluation metrics. We also explain how EPRUM can be used in other IR paradigms.
1148219	Minimal test collections for retrieval evaluation Accurate estimation of information retrieval evaluation metrics such as average precision require large sets of relevance judgments. Building sets large enough for evaluation of real-world implementations is at best inefficient, at worst infeasible. In this work we link evaluation with test collection construction to gain an understanding of the minimal judging effort that must be done to have high confidence in the outcome of an evaluation. A new way of looking at average precision leads to a natural algorithm for selecting documents to judge and allows us to estimate the degree of confidence by defining a distribution over possible document judgments. A study with annotators shows that this method can be used by a small group of researchers to rank a set of systems in under three hours with 95% confidence. Information retrieval metrics such as average precision require large sets of relevance judgments to be accurately estimated. Building these sets is infeasible and often inefficient for many real-world retrieval implementations. We present a new way of looking at average precision that allows us to estimate the confidence in an evaluation based on the size of the test collection. We use this to build an algorithm for selecting the best documents to judge to have maximum confidence in an evaluation with a minimal number of relevance judgments. A study with annotators shows how the algorithm can be used by a small group of researchers to quickly rank a set of systems with 95% confidence.
1148220	Dynamic test collections: measuring search effectiveness on the live web Existing methods for measuring the quality of search algorithms use a static collection of documents. A set of queries and a mapping from the queries to the relevant documents allow the experimenter to see how well different search engines or engine configurations retrieve the correct answers. This methodology assumes that the document set and thus the set of relevant documents are unchanging. In this paper, we abandon the static collection requirement. We begin with a recent TREC collection created from a web crawl and analyze how the documents in that collection have changed over time. We determine how decay of the document collection affects TREC systems, and present the results of an experiment using the decayed collection to measure a live web search system. We employ novel measures of search effectiveness that are robust despite incomplete relevance information. Lastly, we propose a methodology of "collection maintenance" which supports measuring search performance both for a single system and between systems run at different points in time.
1148222	Finding near-duplicate web pages: a large-scale evaluation of algorithms Broder et al.'s [3] shingling algorithm and Charikar's [4] random projection based approach are considered "state-of-the-art" algorithms for finding near-duplicate web pages. Both algorithms were either developed at or used by popular web search engines. We compare the two algorithms on a very large scale, namely on a set of 1.6B distinct web pages. The results show that neither of the algorithms works well for finding near-duplicate pairs on the same site , while both achieve high precision for near-duplicate pairs on different sites . Since Charikar's algorithm finds more near-duplicate pairs on different sites, it achieves a better precision overall, namely 0.50 versus 0.38 for Broder et al.'s algorithm. We present a combined algorithm which achieves precision 0.79 with 79% of the recall of the other algorithms.
1148223	Structure-driven crawler generation by example Many Web IR and Digital Library applications require a crawling process to collect pages with the ultimate goal of taking advantage of useful information available on Web sites. For some of these applications the criteria to determine when a page is to be present in a collection are related to the page content. However, there are situations in which the inner structure of the pages provides a better criteria to guide the crawling process than their content. In this paper, we present a structure-driven approach for generating Web crawlers that requires a minimum effort from users. The idea is to take as input a sample page and an entry point to a Web site and generate a structure-driven crawler based on navigation patterns , sequences of patterns for the links a crawler has to follow to reach the pages structurally similar to the sample page. In the experiments we have carried out, structure-driven crawlers generated by our new approach were able to collect all pages that match the samples given, including those pages added after their generation.
1148224	Building implicit links from content for forum search The objective of Web forums is to create a shared space for open communications and discussions of specific topics and issues. The tremendous information behind forum sites is not fully-utilized yet. Most links between forum pages are automatically created, which means the link-based ranking algorithm cannot be applied efficiently. In this paper, we proposed a novel ranking algorithm which tries to introduce the content information into link-based methods as implicit links. The basic idea is derived from the more focused random surfer: the surfer may more likely jump to a page which is similar to what he is reading currently. In this manner, we are allowed to introduce the content similarities into the link graph as a personalization bias. Our method, named Fine-grained Rank (FGRank), can be efficiently computed based on an automatically generated topic hierarchy. Not like the topic-sensitive PageRank, our method only need to compute single PageRank score for each page. Another contribution of this paper is to present a very efficient algorithm for automatically generating topic hierarchy and map each page in a large-scale collection onto the computed hierarchy. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve retrieval performance, and reveal that content-based link graph is also important compared with the hyper-link graph.
1148225	Generalizing PageRank: damping functions for link-based ranking algorithms This paper introduces a family of link-based ranking algorithms that propagate page importance through links. In these algorithms there is a damping function that decreases with distance, so a direct link implies more endorsement than a link through a long path. PageRank is the most widely known ranking function of this family.The main objective of this paper is to determine whether this family of ranking techniques has some interest per se , and how different choices for the damping function impact on rank quality and on convergence speed. Even though our results suggest that PageRank can be approximated with other simpler forms of rankings that may be computed more efficiently, our focus is of more speculative nature, in that it aims at separating the kernel of PageRank, that is, link-based importance propagation, from the way propagation decays over paths.We focus on three damping functions, having linear, exponential, and hyperbolic decay on the lengths of the paths. The exponential decay corresponds to PageRank, and the other functions are new. Our presentation includes algorithms, analysis, comparisons and experiments that study their behavior under different parameters in real Web graph data.Among other results, we show how to calculate a linear approximation that induces a page ordering that is almost identical to PageRank's using a fixed small number of iterations; comparisons were performed using Kendall's ? on large domain datasets.
1148227	Capturing collection size for distributed non-cooperative retrieval Modern distributed information retrieval techniques require accurate knowledge of collection size. In non-cooperative environments, where detailed collection statistics are not available, the size of the underlying collections must be estimated. While several approaches for the estimation of collection size have been proposed, their accuracy has not been thoroughly evaluated. An empirical analysis of past estimation approaches across a variety of collections demonstrates that their prediction accuracy is low. Motivated by ecological techniques for the estimation of animal populations, we propose two new approaches for the estimation of collection size. We show that our approaches are significantly more accurate that previous methods, and are more efficient in use of resources required to perform the estimation.
1148228	Probabilistic latent query analysis for combining multiple retrieval sources Combining the output from multiple retrieval sources over the same document collection is of great importance to a number of retrieval tasks such as multimedia retrieval, web retrieval and meta-search. To merge retrieval sources adaptively according to query topics, we propose a series of new approaches called probabilistic latent query analysis (pLQA), which can associate non-identical combination weights with latent classes underlying the query space. Compared with previous query independent and query-class based combination methods, the proposed approaches have the advantage of being able to discover latent query classes automatically without using prior human knowledge, to assign one query to a mixture of query classes, and to determine the number of query classes under a model selection principle. Experimental results on two retrieval tasks, i.e., multimedia retrieval and meta-search, demonstrate that the proposed methods can uncover sensible latent classes from training data, and can achieve considerable performance gains.
1148229	User modeling for full-text federated search in peer-to-peer networks User modeling for information retrieval has mostly been studied to improve the effectiveness of information access in centralized repositories. In this paper we explore user modeling in the context of full-text federated search in peer-to-peer networks. Our approach models a user's persistent, long-term interests based on past queries, and uses the model to improve search efficiency for future queries that represent interests similar to past queries. Our approach also enables queries representing a user's transient, ad-hoc interests to be automatically recognized so that search for these queries can rely on a relatively large search radius to avoid sacrificing effectiveness for efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of full-text federated search without degrading its accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed approach does not require a large amount of training data, and is robust to a range of parameter values.
1148230	Distributed query sampling: a quality-conscious approach We present an adaptive distributed query-sampling framework that is quality-conscious for extracting high-quality text database samples. The framework divides the query-based sampling process into an initial seed sampling phase and a quality-aware iterative sampling phase. In the second phase the sampling process is dynamically scheduled based on estimated database size and quality parameters derived during the previous sampling process. The unique characteristic of our adaptive query-based sampling framework is its self-learning and self-configuring ability based on the overall quality of all text databases under consideration. We introduce three quality-conscious sampling schemes for estimating database quality, and our initial results show that the proposed framework supports higher-quality document sampling than existing approaches.
1148232	Load balancing for term-distributed parallel retrieval Large-scale web and text retrieval systems deal with amounts of data that greatly exceed the capacity of any single machine. To handle the necessary data volumes and query throughput rates, parallel systems are used, in which the document and index data are split across tightly-clustered distributed computing systems. The index data can be distributed either by document or by term. In this paper we examine methods for load balancing in term-distributed parallel architectures, and propose a suite of techniques for reducing net querying costs. In combination, the techniques we describe allow a 30% improvement in query throughput when tested on an eight-node parallel computer system.
1148233	Hybrid index maintenance for growing text collections We present a new family of hybrid index maintenance strategies to be used in on-line index construction for monotonically growing text collections. These new strategies improve upon recent results for hybrid index maintenance in dynamic text retrieval systems. Like previous techniques, our new method distinguishes between short and long posting lists: While short lists are maintained using a merge strategy, long lists are kept separate and are updated in-place. This way, costly relocations of long posting lists are avoided.We discuss the shortcomings of previous hybrid methods and give an experimental evaluation of the new technique, showing that its index maintenance performance is superior to that of the earlier methods, especially when the amount of main memory available to the indexing system is small. We also present a complexity analysis which proves that, under a Zipfian term distribution, the asymptotical number of disk accesses performed by the best hybrid maintenance strategy is linear in the size of the text collection, implying the asymptotical optimality of the proposed strategy.
1148234	Type less, find more: fast autocompletion search with a succinct index We consider the following full-text search autocompletion feature. Imagine a user of a search engine typing a query. Then with every letter being typed, we would like an instant display of completions of the last query word which would lead to good hits. At the same time, the best hits for any of these completions should be displayed. Known indexing data structures that apply to this problem either incur large processing times for a substantial class of queries, or they use a lot of space. We present a new indexing data structure that uses no more space than a state-of-the-art compressed inverted index, but with 10 times faster query processing times. Even on the large TREC Terabyte collection, which comprises over 25 million documents, we achieve, on a single machine and with the index on disk, average response times of one tenth of a second. We have built a full-fledged, interactive search engine that realizes the proposed autocompletion feature combined with support for proximity search, semi-structured (XML) text, subword and phrase completion, and semantic tags.
1148235	Pruned query evaluation using pre-computed impacts Exhaustive evaluation of ranked queries can be expensive, particularly when only a small subset of the overall ranking is required, or when queries contain common terms. This concern gives rise to techniques for dynamic query pruning, that is, methods for eliminating redundant parts of the usual exhaustive evaluation, yet still generating a demonstrably "good enough" set of answers to the query. In this work we propose new pruning methods that make use of impact-sorted indexes. Compared to exhaustive evaluation, the new methods reduce the amount of computation performed, reduce the amount of memory required for accumulators, reduce the amount of data transferred from disk, and at the same time allow performance guarantees in terms of precision and mean average precision. These strong claims are backed by experiments using the TREC Terabyte collection and queries.
1148237	Mining dependency relations for query expansion in passage retrieval Classical query expansion techniques such as the local context analysis (LCA) make use of term co-occurrence statistics to incorporate additional contextual terms for enhancing passage retrieval. However, relevant contextual terms do not always co-occur frequently with the query terms and vice versa. Hence the use of such methods often brings in noise, which leads to reduced precision. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of relationship analysis for natural language queries in passage retrieval. However, they found that without query expansion, the performance is not satisfactory for short queries. In this paper, we present two novel query expansion techniques that make use of dependency relation analysis to extract contextual terms and relations from external corpuses. The techniques are used to enhance the performance of density based and relation based passage retrieval frameworks respectively. We compare the performance of the resulting systems with LCA in a density based passage retrieval system (DBS) and a relation based system without any query expansion (RBS) using the factoid questions from the TREC-12 QA task. The results show that in terms of MRR scores, our relation based term expansion method with DBS outperforms the LCA by 9.81%, while our relation expansion method outperforms RBS by 17.49%.
1148238	What makes a query difficult? This work tries to answer the question of what makes a query difficult. It addresses a novel model that captures the main components of a topic and the relationship between those components and topic difficulty. The three components of a topic are the textual expression describing the information need (the query or queries), the set of documents relevant to the topic (the Qrels), and the entire collection of documents. We show experimentally that topic difficulty strongly depends on the distances between these components. In the absence of knowledge about one of the model components, the model is still useful by approximating the missing component based on the other components. We demonstrate the applicability of the difficulty model for several uses such as predicting query difficulty, predicting the number of topic aspects expected to be covered by the search results, and analyzing the findability of a specific domain.
1148239	On ranking the effectiveness of searches There is a growing interest in estimating the effectiveness of search. Two approaches are typically considered: examining the search queries and examining the retrieved document sets. In this paper, we take the latter approach. We use four measures to characterize the retrieved document sets and estimate the quality of search. These measures are (i) the clustering tendency as measured by the Cox-Lewis statistic, (ii) the sensitivity to document perturbation, (iii) the sensitivity to query perturbation and (iv) the local intrinsic dimensionality. We present experimental results for the task of ranking 200 queries according to the search effectiveness over the TREC (discs 4 and 5) dataset. Our ranking of queries is compared with the ranking based on the average precision using the Kendall t statistic. The best individual estimator is the sensitivity to document perturbation and yields Kendall t of 0.521. When combined with the clustering tendency based on the Cox-Lewis statistic and the query perturbation measure, it results in Kendall t of 0.562 which to our knowledge is the highest correlation with the average precision reported to date.
1148241	Document clustering with prior knowledge Document clustering is an important tool for text analysis and is used in many different applications. We propose to incorporate prior knowledge of cluster membership for document cluster analysis and develop a novel semi-supervised document clustering model. The method models a set of documents with weighted graph in which each document is represented as a vertex, and each edge connecting a pair of vertices is weighted with the similarity value of the two corresponding documents. The prior knowledge indicates pairs of documents that known to belong to the same cluster. Then, the prior knowledge is transformed into a set of constraints. The document clustering task is accomplished by finding the best cuts of the graph under the constraints. We apply the model to the Normalized Cut method to demonstrate the idea and concept. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering model reveals remarkable performance improvements with very limited training samples, and hence is a very effective semi-supervised classification tool.
1148242	Text clustering with extended user feedback Text clustering is most commonly treated as a fully automated task without user feedback. However, a variety of researchers have explored mixed-initiative clustering methods which allow a user to interact with and advise the clustering algorithm. This mixed-initiative approach is especially attractive for text clustering tasks where the user is trying to organize a corpus of documents into clusters for some particular purpose (e.g., clustering their email into folders that reflect various activities in which they are involved). This paper introduces a new approach to mixed-initiative clustering that handles several natural types of user feedback. We first introduce a new probabilistic generative model for text clustering (the SpeClustering model) and show that it outperforms the commonly used mixture of multinomials clustering model, even when used in fully autonomous mode with no user input. We then describe how to incorporate four distinct types of user feedback into the clustering algorithm, and provide experimental evidence showing substantial improvements in text clustering when this user feedback is incorporated.
1148243	Near-duplicate detection by instance-level constrained clustering For the task of near-duplicated document detection, both traditional fingerprinting techniques used in database community and bag-of-word comparison approaches used in information retrieval community are not sufficiently accurate. This is due to the fact that the characteristics of near-duplicated documents are different from that of both "almost-identical" documents in the data cleaning task and "relevant" documents in the search task. This paper presents an instance-level constrained clustering approach for near-duplicate detection. The framework incorporates information such as document attributes and content structure into the clustering process to form near-duplicate clusters. Gathered from several collections of public comments sent to U.S. government agencies on proposed new regulations, the experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other near-duplicate detection algorithms and as about as effective as human assessors.
1148245	Less is more: probabilistic models for retrieving fewer relevant documents Traditionally, information retrieval systems aim to maximize the number of relevant documents returned to a user within some window of the top. For that goal, the probability ranking principle, which ranks documents in decreasing order of probability of relevance, is provably optimal. However, there are many scenarios in which that ranking does not optimize for the users information need. One example is when the user would be satisfied with some limited number of relevant documents, rather than needing all relevant documents. We show that in such a scenario, an attempt to return many relevant documents can actually reduce the chances of finding any relevant documents. We consider a number of information retrieval metrics from the literature, including the rank of the first relevant result, the %no metric that penalizes a system only for retrieving no relevant results near the top, and the diversity of retrieved results when queries have multiple interpretations. We observe that given a probabilistic model of relevance, it is appropriate to rank so as to directly optimize these metrics in expectation. While doing so may be computationally intractable, we show that a simple greedy optimization algorithm that approximately optimizes the given objectives produces rankings for TREC queries that outperform the standard approach based on the probability ranking principle.
1148246	High accuracy retrieval with multiple nested ranker High precision at the top ranks has become a new focus of research in information retrieval. This paper presents the multiple nested ranker approach that improves the accuracy at the top ranks by iteratively re-ranking the top scoring documents. At each iteration, this approach uses the RankNet learning algorithm to re-rank a subset of the results. This splits the problem into smaller and easier tasks and generates a new distribution of the results to be learned by the algorithm. We evaluate this approach using different settings on a data set labeled with several degrees of relevance. We use the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) to measure the performance because it depends not only on the position but also on the relevance score of the document in the ranked list. Our experiments show that making the learning algorithm concentrate on the top scoring results improves precision at the top ten documents in terms of the NDCG score.
1148247	Semantic search via XML fragments: a high-precision approach to IR In some IR applications, it is desirable to adopt a high precision search strategy to return a small set of documents that are highly focused and relevant to the user's information need. With these applications in mind, we investigate semantic search using the XML Fragments query language on text corpora automatically pre-processed to encode semantic information useful for retrieval. We identify three XML Fragment operations that can be applied to a query to conceptualize , restrict , or relate terms in the query. We demonstrate how these operations can be used to address four different query-time semantic needs: to specify target information type , to disambiguate keywords , to specify search term context , or to relate select terms in the query. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our semantic search technology through a series of experiments using the two applications in which we embed this technology and show that it yields significant improvement in precision in the search results.
1148249	Elicitation of term relevance feedback: an investigation of term source and context Term relevance feedback has had a long history in information retrieval. However, research on interactive term relevance feedback has yielded mixed results. In this paper, we investigate several aspects related to the elicitation of term relevance feedback: the display of document surrogates, the technique for identifying or selecting terms, and sources of expansion terms. We conduct a between subjects experiment (n=61) of three term relevance feedback interfaces using the 2005 TREC HARD collection, and evaluate each interface with respect to query length and retrieval performance. Results demonstrate that queries created with each experimental interface significantly outperformed corresponding baseline queries, even though there were no differences in performance between interface conditions. Results also demonstrate that pseudo-relevance feedback runs outperformed both baseline and experimental runs as assessed by recall-oriented measures, but that user-generated terms improved precision.
1148250	Find-similar: similarity browsing as a search tool Search systems have for some time provided users with the ability to request documents similar to a given document. Interfaces provide this feature via a link or button for each document in the search results. We call this feature find-similar or similarity browsing . We examined find-similar as a search tool, like relevance feedback, for improving retrieval performance. Our investigation focused on find-similar's document-to-document similarity, the reexamination of documents during a search, and the user's browsing pattern. Find-similar with a query-biased similarity, avoiding the reexamination of documents, and a breadth-like browsing pattern achieved a 23% increase in the arithmetic mean average precision and a 66% increase in the geometric mean average precision over our baseline retrieval. This performance matched that of a more traditionally styled iterative relevance feedback technique.
1148251	Exploring the limits of single-iteration clarification dialogs Single-iteration clarification dialogs, as implemented in the TREC HARD track, represent an attempt to introduce interaction into ad hoc retrieval, while preserving the many benefits of large-scale evaluations. Although previous experiments have not conclusively demonstrated performance gains resulting from such interactions, it is unclear whether these findings speak to the nature of clarification dialogs, or simply the limitations of current systems. To probe the limits of such interactions, we employed a human intermediary to formulate clarification questions and exploit user responses. In addition to establishing a plausible upper bound on performance, we were also able to induce an "ontology of clarifications" to characterize human behavior. This ontology, in turn, serves as the input to a regression model that attempts to determine which types of clarification questions are most helpful. Our work can serve to inform the design of interactive systems that initiate user dialogs.
1148253	Large scale semi-supervised linear SVMs Large scale learning is often realistic only in a semi-supervised setting where a small set of labeled examples is available together with a large collection of unlabeled data. In many information retrieval and data mining applications, linear classifiers are strongly preferred because of their ease of implementation, interpretability and empirical performance. In this work, we present a family of semi-supervised linear support vector classifiers that are designed to handle partially-labeled sparse datasets with possibly very large number of examples and features. At their core, our algorithms employ recently developed modified finite Newton techniques. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (a) We provide an implementation of Transductive SVM (TSVM) that is significantly more efficient and scalable than currently used dual techniques, for linear classification problems involving large, sparse datasets. (b) We propose a variant of TSVM that involves multiple switching of labels. Experimental results show that this variant provides an order of magnitude further improvement in training efficiency. (c) We present a new algorithm for semi-supervised learning based on a Deterministic Annealing (DA) approach. This algorithm alleviates the problem of local minimum in the TSVM optimization procedure while also being computationally attractive. We conduct an empirical study on several document classification tasks which confirms the value of our methods in large scale semi-supervised settings.
1148254	Graph-based text classification: learn from your neighbors Automatic classification of data items, based on training samples, can be boosted by considering the neighborhood of data items in a graph structure (e.g., neighboring documents in a hyperlink environment or co-authors and their publications for bibliographic data entries). This paper presents a new method for graph-based classification, with particular emphasis on hyperlinked text documents but broader applicability. Our approach is based on iterative relaxation labeling and can be combined with either Bayesian or SVM classifiers on the feature spaces of the given data items. The graph neighborhood is taken into consideration to exploit locality patterns while at the same time avoiding overfitting. In contrast to prior work along these lines, our approach employs a number of novel techniques: dynamically inferring the link/class pattern in the graph in the run of the iterative relaxation labeling, judicious pruning of edges from the neighborhood graph based on node dissimilarities and node degrees, weighting the influence of edges based on a distance metric between the classification labels of interest and weighting edges by content similarity measures. Our techniques considerably improve the robustness and accuracy of the classification outcome, as shown in systematic experimental comparisons with previously published methods on three different real-world datasets.
1148255	Constructing informative prior distributions from domain knowledge in text classification Supervised learning approaches to text classification are in practice often required to work with small and unsystematically collected training sets. The alternative to supervised learning is usually viewed to be building classifiers by hand, using a domain expert's understanding of which features of the text are related to the class of interest. This is expensive, requires a degree of sophistication about linguistics and classification, and makes it difficult to use combinations of weak predictors. We propose instead combining domain knowledge with training examples in a Bayesian framework. Domain knowledge is used to specify a prior distribution for the parameters of a logistic regression model, and labeled training data is used to produce a posterior distribution, whose mode we take as the final classifier. We show on three text categorization data sets that this approach can rescue what would otherwise be disastrously bad training situations, producing much more effective classifiers.
1148257	Unifying user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches by similarity fusion Memory-based methods for collaborative filtering predict new ratings by averaging (weighted) ratings between, respectively, pairs of similar users or items. In practice, a large number of ratings from similar users or similar items are not available, due to the sparsity inherent to rating data. Consequently, prediction quality can be poor. This paper re-formulates the memory-based collaborative filtering problem in a generative probabilistic framework, treating individual user-item ratings as predictors of missing ratings. The final rating is estimated by fusing predictions from three sources: predictions based on ratings of the same item by other users, predictions based on different item ratings made by the same user, and, third, ratings predicted based on data from other but similar users rating other but similar items. Existing user-based and item-based approaches correspond to the two simple cases of our framework. The complete model is however more robust to data sparsity, because the different types of ratings are used in concert, while additional ratings from similar users towards similar items are employed as a background model to smooth the predictions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are indeed more robust against data sparsity and give better recommendations.
1148258	Personalized recommendation driven by information flow We propose that the information access behavior of a group of people can be modeled as an information flow issue, in which people intentionally or unintentionally influence and inspire each other, thus creating an interest in retrieving or getting a specific kind of information or product. Information flow models how information is propagated in a social network. It can be a real social network where interactions between people reside; it can be, moreover, a virtual social network in that people only influence each other unintentionally, for instance, through collaborative filtering. We leverage users' access patterns to model information flow and generate effective personalized recommendations. First, an early adoption based information flow (EABIF) network describes the influential relationships between people. Second, based on the fact that adoption is typically category specific, we propose a topic-sensitive EABIF (TEABIF) network, in which access patterns are clustered with respect to the categories. Once an item has been accessed by early adopters, personalized recommendations are achieved by estimating whom the information will be propagated to with high probabilities. In our experiments with an online document recommendation system, the results demonstrate that the EABIF and the TEABIF can respectively achieve an improved (precision, recall) of (91.0%, 87.1%) and (108.5%, 112.8%) compared to traditional collaborative filtering, given an early adopter exists.
1148259	Analysis of a low-dimensional linear model under recommendation attacks Collaborative filtering techniques have become popular in the past decade as an effective way to help people deal with information overload. Recent research has identified significant vulnerabilities in collaborative filtering techniques. Shilling attacks, in which attackers introduce biased ratings to influence recommendation systems, have been shown to be effective against memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms. We examine the effectiveness of two popular shilling attacks (the random attack and the average attack) on a model-based algorithm that uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to learn a low-dimensional linear model. Our results show that the SVD-based algorithm is much more resistant to shilling attacks than memory-based algorithms. Furthermore, we develop an attack detection method directly built on the SVD-based algorithm and show that this method detects random shilling attacks with high detection rates and very low false alarm rates.
1148261	Evaluating evaluation metrics based on the bootstrap This paper describes how the Bootstrap approach to statistics can be applied to the evaluation of IR effectiveness metrics. First, we argue that Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests deserve more attention from the IR community, as they are based on fewer assumptions than traditional statistical significance tests. We then describe straightforward methods for comparing the sensitivity of IR metrics based on Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests. Unlike the heuristics-based "swap" method proposed by Voorhees and Buckley, our method estimates the performance difference required to achieve a given significance level directly from Bootstrap Hypothesis Test results. In addition, we describe a simple way of examining the accuracy of rank correlation between two metrics based on the Bootstrap Estimate of Standard Error. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods using test collections and runs from the NTCIR CLIR track for comparing seven IR metrics, including those that can handle graded relevance and those based on the Geometric Mean.
1148262	Statistical precision of information retrieval evaluation We introduce and validate bootstrap techniques to compute confidence intervals that quantify the effect of test-collection variability on average precision (AP) and mean average precision (MAP) IR effectiveness measures. We consider the test collection in IR evaluation to be a representative of a population of materially similar collections, whose documents are drawn from an infinite pool with similar characteristics. Our model accurately predicts the degree of concordance between system results on randomly selected halves of the TREC-6 ad hoc corpus. We advance a framework for statistical evaluation that uses the same general framework to model other sources of chance variation as a source of input for meta-analysis techniques.
1148263	A statistical method for system evaluation using incomplete judgments We consider the problem of large-scale retrieval evaluation, and we propose a statistical method for evaluating retrieval systems using incomplete judgments. Unlike existing techniques that (1) rely on effectively complete, and thus prohibitively expensive, relevance judgment sets, (2) produce biased estimates of standard performance measures, or (3) produce estimates of non-standard measures thought to be correlated with these standard measures, our proposed statistical technique produces unbiased estimates of the standard measures themselves.Our proposed technique is based on random sampling. While our estimates are unbiased by statistical design, their variance is dependent on the sampling distribution employed; as such, we derive a sampling distribution likely to yield low variance estimates. We test our proposed technique using benchmark TREC data, demonstrating that a sampling pool derived from a set of runs can be used to efficiently and effectively evaluate those runs. We further show that these sampling pools generalize well to unseen runs. Our experiments indicate that highly accurate estimates of standard performance measures can be obtained using a number of relevance judgments as small as 4% of the typical TREC-style judgment pool.
1148265	Learning to advertise Content-targeted advertising, the task of automatically associating ads to a Web page, constitutes a key Web monetization strategy nowadays. Further, it introduces new challenging technical problems and raises interesting questions. For instance, how to design ranking functions able to satisfy conflicting goals such as selecting advertisements (ads) that are relevant to the users and suitable and profitable to the publishers and advertisers? In this paper we propose a new framework for associating ads with web pages based on Genetic Programming (GP). Our GP method aims at learning functions that select the most appropriate ads, given the contents of a Web page. These ranking functions are designed to optimize overall precision and minimize the number of misplacements. By using a real ad collection and web pages from a newspaper, we obtained a gain over a state-of-the-art baseline method of 61.7% in average precision. Further, by evolving individuals to provide good ranking estimations, GP was able to discover ranking functions that are very effective in placing ads in web pages while avoiding irrelevant ones.
1148266	Getting work done on the web: supporting transactional queries Many searches on the web have a transactional intent. We argue that pages satisfying transactional needs can be distinguished from the more common pages that have some information and links, but cannot be used to execute a transaction. Based on this hypothesis, we provide a recipe for constructing a transaction annotator. By constructing an annotator with one corpus and then demonstrating its classification performance on another,we establish its robustness. Finally, we show experimentally that a search procedure that exploits such pre-annotation greatly outperforms traditional search for retrieving transactional pages.
1148267	You are what you say: privacy risks of public mentions In today's data-rich networked world, people express many aspects of their lives online. It is common to segregate different aspects in different places: you might write opinionated rants about movies in your blog under a pseudonym while participating in a forum or web site for scholarly discussion of medical ethics under your real name. However, it may be possible to link these separate identities, because the movies, journal articles, or authors you mention are from a sparse relation space whose properties (e.g., many items related to by only a few users) allow re-identification . This re-identification violates people's intentions to separate aspects of their life and can have negative consequences; it also may allow other privacy violations, such as obtaining a stronger identifier like name and address.This paper examines this general problem in a specific setting: re-identification of users from a public web movie forum in a private movie ratings dataset. We present three major results. First, we develop algorithms that can re-identify a large proportion of public users in a sparse relation space. Second, we evaluate whether private dataset owners can protect user privacy by hiding data; we show that this requires extensive and undesirable changes to the dataset, making it impractical. Third, we evaluate two methods for users in a public forum to protect their own privacy, suppression and misdirection. Suppression doesn't work here either. However, we show that a simple misdirection strategy works well: mention a few popular items that you haven't rated.
1148269	A compositional context sensitive multi-document summarizer: exploring the factors that influence summarization The usual approach for automatic summarization is sentence extraction, where key sentences from the input documents are selected based on a suite of features. While word frequency often is used as a feature in summarization, its impact on system performance has not been isolated. In this paper, we study the contribution to summarization of three factors related to frequency: content word frequency, composition functions for estimating sentence importance from word frequency, and adjustment of frequency weights based on context. We carry out our analysis using datasets from the Document Understanding Conferences, studying not only the impact of these features on automatic summarizers, but also their role in human summarization. Our research shows that a frequency based summarizer can achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art systems, but only with a good composition function; context sensitivity improves performance and significantly reduces repetition.
1148270	Information graphics: an untapped resource for digital libraries Information graphics are non-pictorial graphics such as bar charts and line graphs that depict attributes of entities and relations among entities. Most information graphics appearing in popular media have a communicative goal or intended message; consequently, information graphics constitute a form of language. This paper argues that information graphics are a valuable knowledge resource that should be retrievable from a digital library and that such graphics should be taken into account when summarizing a multimodal document for subsequent indexing and retrieval. But to accomplish this, the information graphic must be understood and its message recognized. The paper presents our Bayesian system for recognizing the primary message of one kind of information graphic (simple bar charts) and discusses the potential role of an information graphic's message in indexing graphics and summarizing multimodal documents.
1148271	News to go: hierarchical text summarization for mobile devices We present an evaluation of a novel hierarchical text summarization method that allows users to view summaries of Web documents from small, mobile devices. Unlike previous approaches, ours does not require the documents to be in HTML since it infers a hierarchical structure automatically. Currently, the method is used to summarize news articles sent to a Web mail account in plain text format. Subjects used a Web-enabled mobile phone emulator to access the account's inbox and view the summarized news articles. They then used the summaries to complete several information-seeking tasks, which involved answering factual questions about the stories. In comparing the hierarchical text summary setting to that in which subjects were given the full text articles, there was no significant difference in task accuracy or the time taken to complete the task. However, in the hierarchical summarization setting, the number of bytes transferred per user request is less than half that of the full text case. Finally, in comparing the new method to three other summarization methods, subjects achieved significantly better accuracy on the tasks when using hierarchical summaries.
1148273	Clustering of search results using temporal attributes Clustering of search results is an important feature in many of today's information retrieval applications. The notion of hit list clustering appears in Web search engines and enterprise search engines as a mechanism that allows users to further explore the coverage of a query. However, there has been little work on exposing temporal attributes for constructing and presentation of clusters. These attributes appear in documents as part of the textual content, e.g., as a date and time token or as a temporal reference in a sentence. In this paper, we outline a model and describe a prototype that shows the main ideas.
1148274	A complex document information processing prototype We developed a prototype for integrated retrieval and aggregation of diverse information contained in scanned paper documents. Such complex document information processing combines several forms of image processing together with textual/linguistic processing to enable effective analysis of complex document collections, a necessity for a wide range of applications. This is the first system to attempt integrated retrieval from complex documents; we report its current capabilities.
1148275	Inferring document relevance via average precision We consider the problem of evaluating retrieval systems using a limited number of relevance judgments. Recent work has demonstrated that one can accurately estimate average precision via a judged pool corresponding to a relatively small random sample of documents. In this work, we demonstrate that given values or estimates of average precision, one can accurately infer the relevances of unjudged documents. Combined, we thus show how one can efficiently and accurately infer a large judged pool from a relatively small number of judged documents, thus permitting accurate and efficient retrieval evaluation on a large scale.

1148280	User expectations from XML element retrieval The primary aim of XML element retrieval is to return to users XML elements, rather than whole documents. This poster describes a small study, in which we elicited users' expectations, i.e. their anticipated experience, when interacting with an XML retrieval system, as compared to a traditional 'flat' document retrieval system.
1148281	Theoretical benchmarks of XML retrieval This poster investigates the use of theoretical benchmarks to describe the matching functions of XML retrieval systems and the properties of specificity and exhaustivity in XML retrieval. Theoretical benchmarks concern the formal representation of qualitative properties of IR models. To this end, Situation Theory framework for the meta-evaluation of XML retrieval is presented.
1148282	Question classification with log-linear models Question classification has become a crucial step in modern question answering systems. Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of statistical machine learning approaches to this problem. This paper presents a new approach to building a question classifier using log-linear models. Evidence from a rich and diverse set of syntactic and semantic features is evaluated, as well as approaches which exploit the hierarchical structure of the question classes.
1148283	Community-based snippet-indexes for pseudo-anonymous personalization in web search We describe and evaluate an approach to personalizing Web search that involves post-processing the results returned by some underlying search engine so that they re .ect the interests of a community of like-minded searchers.To do this we leverage the search experiences of the community by mining the title and snippet texts of results that have been selected by community members in response to their queries. Our approach seeks to build a community-based snippet index that re .ects the evolving interests of a group of searchers. This index is then sed to re-rank the results returned by the underlying search engine by boosting the ranking of key results that have been freq ently selected for similar q eries by community members in the past.
1148284	Bias and the limits of pooling Modern retrieval test collections are built through a process called pooling in which only a sample of the entire document set is judged for each topic. The idea behind pooling is to find enough relevant documents such that when unjudged documents are assumed to be nonrelevant the resulting judgment set is sufficiently complete and unbiased. As document sets grow larger, a constant-size pool represents an increasingly small percentage of the document set, and at some point the assumption of approximately complete judgments must become invalid.This paper demonstrates that the AQUAINT 2005 test collection exhibits bias caused by pools that were too shallow for the document set size despite having many diverse runs contribute to the pools. The existing judgment set favors relevant documents that contain topic title words even though relevant documents containing few topic title words are known to exist in the document set. The paper concludes with suggested modifications to traditional pooling and evaluation methodology that may allow very large reusable test collections to be built.
1148285	Term proximity scoring for ad-hoc retrieval on very large text collections We propose an integration of term proximity scoring into Okapi BM25. The relative retrieval effectiveness of our retrieval method, compared to pure BM25, varies from collection to collection.We present an experimental evaluation of our method and show that the gains achieved over BM25 as the size of the underlying text collection increases. We also show that for stemmed queries the impact of term proximity scoring is larger than for unstemmed queries.
1148286	An exploratory web log study of multitasking The Web search multitasking study based on automatic task session detection procedure is described. The results of the study: 1) multitasking is very rare, 2) it usually covers only 2 task sessions, 3) it is frequently formed into a temporal inclusion of an interrupting task session into the interrupted session, 4) the quantitative characteristics of multitasking greatly differ from the characteristics of sequential execution of one and several tasks. A searcher minimizes task switching costs: he avoids multitasking and while multitasking he uses cheapest manner of task switching.
1148287	Tensor space model for document analysis Vector Space Model (VSM) has been at the core of information retrieval for the past decades. VSM considers the documents as vectors in high dimensional space.In such a vector space, techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, etc., can be then applied for indexing and classification. However, in some cases, the dimensionality of the document space might be extremely large, which makes these techniques infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality . In this paper, we propose a novel Tensor Space Model for document analysis. We represent documents as the second order tensors, or matrices. Correspondingly, a novel indexing algorithm called Tensor Latent Semantic Indexing (TensorLSI) is developed in the tensor space. Our theoretical analysis shows that TensorLSI is much more computationally efficient than the conventional Latent Semantic Indexing, which makes it applicable for extremely large scale data set. Several experimental results on standard document data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.
1148288	First large-scale information retrieval experiments on turkish texts We present the results of the first large-scale Turkish information retrieval experiments performed on a TREC-like test collection. The test bed, which has been created for this study, contains 95.5 million words, 408,305 documents, 72 ad hoc queries and has a size of about 800MB. All documents come from the Turkish newspaper Milliyet . We implement and apply simple to sophisticated stemmers and various query-document matching functions and show that truncating words at a prefix length of 5 creates an effective retrieval environment in Turkish. However, a lemmatizer-based stemmer provides significantly better effectiveness over a variety of matching functions.
1148289	Learning a ranking from pairwise preferences We introduce a novel approach to combining rankings from multiple retrieval systems. We use a logistic regression model or an SVM to learn a ranking from pairwise document preferences. Our approach requires no training data or relevance scores, and outperforms a popular voting algorithm.
1148290	Automated performance assessment in interactive QA In interactive question answering (QA), users and systems take turns to ask questions and provide answers. In such an interactive setting, user questions largely depend on the answers provided by the system. One question is whether user follow-up questions can provide feedback for the system to automatically assess its performance (e.g., assess whether a correct answer is delivered). This self-awareness can make QA systems more intelligent for information seeking, for example, by adapting better strategies to cope with problematic situations. Therefore, this paper describes our initial investigation in addressing this problem. Our results indicate that interaction context can provide useful cues for automated performance assessment in interactive QA.
1148291	Stylistic text segmentation This paper focuses on a method for the stylistic segmentation of text documents. Our technique involves mapping the change in a feature throughout a text. We use the linguistic features of conjunction and modality, through taxonomies from Systemic Functional Linguistics. This segmentation has applications in automated summarization, particularly of large documents.
1148292	On hierarchical web catalog integration with conceptual relationships in thesaurus Web catalog integration is an interesting problem in current digital content management. Past studies have shown that using a flattened structure with auxiliary information extracted from the source catalog can improve the integration results. However, the nature of a flattened structure ignores the hierarchical relationships, and thus the performance improvement of catalog integration may be reduced. In this paper, we propose an enhanced hierarchical catalog integration (EHCI) approach with conceptual thesauri extracted from the source catalog. The results show that our enhanced hierarchical integration approach effectively boosts the accuracy of hierarchical catalog integration.
1148293	Rpref: a generalization of Bpref towards graded relevance judgments We present rpref ; our generalization of the bpref evaluation metric for assessing the quality of search engine results, given graded rather than binary user relevance judgments.
1148294	A new web page summarization method In this paper, we present a novel multi-webpage summarization algorithm. It adds the graph based ranking algorithm into the framework of Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) method, to not only capture the main topic of the web pages but also eliminate the redundancy existing in the sentences of the summary result. The experiment result indicates that the new approach has the better performance than the previous methods.
1148295	NMF and PLSI: equivalence and a hybrid algorithm In this paper, we show that PLSI and NMF optimize the same objective function, although PLSI and NMF are different algorithms as verified by experiments. In addition, we also propose a new hybrid method that runs PLSI and NMF alternatively to achieve better solutions.
1148296	Using historical data to enhance rank aggregation Rank aggregation is a pervading operation in IR technology. We hypothesize that the performance of score-based aggregation may be affected by artificial, usually meaningless deviations consistently occurring in the input score distributions, which distort the combined result when the individual biases differ from each other. We propose a score-based rank aggregation model where the source scores are normalized to a common distribution before being combined. Early experiments on available data from several TREC collections are shown to support our proposal.
1148297	Enterprise search behaviour of software engineers Technical professionals spend ~25% of their time at work searching for information, and have specialized information needs that are not well-served by generic enterprise search tools. In this study, we investigated how a group of software engineers use a workplace search system. We identify patterns of search behaviour specific to this group and distinct from general web and intranet search patterns, and make design recommendations for search systems that will better serve the needs of this group.
1148298	Evaluating sources of query expansion terms This study investigates the effectiveness of retrieval systems and human users in generating terms for query expansion. We compare three sources of terms: system generated terms, terms users select from top-ranked sentences, and user generated terms. Results demonstrate that overall the system generated more effective expansion terms than users, but that users' selection of terms improved precision at the top of the retrieved document list.

1148300	Information retrieval with commonsense knowledge This paper employs ConceptNet, which covers a rich set of commonsense concepts, to retrieve images with text descriptions by focusing on spatial relationships. Evaluation on test data of the 2005 ImageCLEF shows that integrating commonsense knowledge in information retrieval is feasible.

1148302	Quantative analysis of the impact of judging inconsistency on the performance of relevance feedback Practical constrains of user interfaces make the user's judgment (during the feedback loop) deviate from real thoughts (when the full document is read).This is often overlooked in evaluation of relevance feedback.This paper quantitatively analyze the impact of judging inconsistency on the performance of relevance feedback.
1148303	Swordfish: an unsupervised Ngram based approach to morphological analysis Extracting morphemes from words is a nontrivial task. Rule based stemming approaches such as Porter's algorithm have encountered some success, however they are restricted by their ability to identify a limited number of affixes and are language dependent. When dealing with languages with many affixes, rule based approaches generally require many more rules to deal with all the possible word forms. Deriving these rules requires a larger effort on the part of linguists and in some instances can be simply impractical. We propose an unsupervised ngram based approach, named Swordfish. Using ngram probabilities in the corpus, possible morphemes are identified. We look at two possible methods for identifying candidate morphemes, one using joint probabilities between two ngrams, and the second based on log odds between prefix probabilities. Initial results indicate the joint probability approach to be better for English while the prefix ratio approach is better for Finnish and Turkish.
1148304	Authorship attribution with thousands of candidate authors In this paper, we use a blog corpus to demonstrate that we can often identify the author of an anonymous text even where there are many thousands of candidate authors. Our approach combines standard information retrieval methods with a text categorization meta-learning scheme that determines when to even venture a guess.
1148305	Simple questions to improve pseudo-relevance feedback results We explore interactive methods to further improve the performance of pseudo-relevance feedback. Studies citeria suggest that new methods for tackling difficult queries are required. Our approach is to gather more information about the query from the user by asking her simple questions. The equally simple responses are used to modify the original query. Our experiments using the TREC Robust Track queries show that we can obtain a significant improvement in mean average precision averaging around 5% over pseudo-relevance feedback. This improvement is also spread across more queries compared to ordinary pseudo-relevance feedback, as suggested by geometric mean average precision.
1148306	Is XML retrieval meaningful to users?: searcher preferences for full documents vs. elements The aim of this study is to investigate whether element retrieval (as opposed to full-text retrieval) is meaningful and useful for searchers when carrying out information-seeking tasks. Our results suggest that searchers find the structural breakdown of documents useful when browsing within retrieved documents, and provide support for the usefulness of element retrieval in interactive settings.
1148307	Building a test collection for complex document information processing Research and development of information access technology for scanned paper documents has been hampered by the lack of public test collections of realistic scope and complexity. As part of a project to create a prototype system for search and mining of masses of document images, we are assembling a 1.5 terabyte dataset to support evaluation of both end-to-end complex document information processing (CDIP) tasks (e.g., text retrieval and data mining) as well as component technologies such as optical character recognition (OCR), document structure analysis, signature matching, and authorship attribution.
1148308	Enhancing topic tracking with temporal information In this paper, we propose a new strategy with time granularity reasoning for utilizing temporal information in topic tracking. Compared with previous ones, our work has four distinguished characteristics. Firstly, we try to determine a set of topic times for a target topic from the given on-topic stories. It helps to avoid the negative influence from other irrelevant times. Secondly, we take into account time granularity variance when deciding whether a coreference relationship exists between two times. Thirdly, both publication time and times presented in texts are considered. Finally, as time is only one attribute of a topic, we increase the similarity between a story and a target topic only when they are related not only temporally but also semantically. Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our method makes good use of temporal information in news stories.
1148309	A comparative study of the effect of search feature design on user experience in digital libraries (DLs) This study investigates the impact of different search feature designs in DLs on user search experience. The results indicate that the impact is significant in terms of the number of queries issued, search steps, zero-hits pages returned, and search errors.

1148311	One-sided measures for evaluating ranked retrieval effectiveness with spontaneous conversational speech Early speech retrieval experiments focused on news broadcasts, for which adequate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) accuracy could be obtained. Like newspapers, news broadcasts are a manually selected and arranged set of stories. Evaluation designs reflected that, using known story boundaries as a basis for evaluation. Substantial advances in ASR accuracy now make it possible to build search systems for some types of spontaneous conversational speech, but present evaluation designs continue to rely on known topic boundaries that are no longer well matched to the nature of the materials. We propose a new class of measures for speech retrieval based on manual annotation of points at which a user with specific topical interests would wish replay to begin.
1148312	Combining fields in known-item email search Emails are examples of structured documents with various fields. These fields can be exploited to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of an Information Retrieval (IR) system that mailing list archives. In recent experiments of the TREC2005 Enterprise track, various fields were applied to varying degrees of success by the participants. In his work, using a field-based weighting model, we investigate the retrieval performance attainable by each field, and examine when fields evidence should be combined or not.
1148313	Improving QA retrieval using document priors We present a simple way to improve document retrieval for question answering systems. The method biases the retrieval system toward documents that contain words that have appeared in other documents containing answers to the same type of question. The method works with virtually any retrieval system, and exhibits a statistically significant performance improvement over a strong baseline.
1148314	Content-based video retrieval: does video's semantic visual feature matter? A new shot level video browsing method based on semantic visual features (e.g., car, mountain, and fire) is proposed to facilitate content-based retrieval. The video's binary semantic feature vector is utilized to calculate the score of similarity between two shot keyframes. The score is then used to browse the "similar" keyframes in terms of semantic visual features. A pilot user study was conducted to better understand users' behaviors in video retrieval context. Three video retrieval and browsing systems are compared: temporal neighbor, semantic visual feature, and fused browsing system. The initial results indicated that the semantic visual feature browsing was effective and efficient for Visual Centric tasks, but not for Non-visual Centric tasks.
1148315	Action modeling: language models that predict query behavior We present a novel language modeling approach to capturing the query reformulation behavior of Web search users. Based on a framework that categorizes eight different types of "user moves" (adding/removing query terms, etc.), we treat search sessions as sequence data and build n-gram language models to capture user behavior. We evaluated our models in a prediction task. The results suggest that useful patterns of activity can be extracted from user histories. Furthermore, by examining prediction performance under different order n-gram models, we gained insight into the amount of history/context that is associated with different types of user actions. Our work serves as the basis for more refined user models.
1148316	A method of rating the credibility of news documents on the web We propose a method to rate the credibility of news articles using three clues: (1) commonality of the contents of articles among different news publishers; (2) numerical agreement versus contradiction of numerical values reported in the articles; and (3) objectivity based on subjective speculative phrases and news sources. We tested this method on news stories taken from seven different news sites on the Web. The average agreement between the system-produced "credibility" and the manual judgments of three human assessors on the 52 sample articles was 69.1%. The limitations of the current approach and future directions are discussed.
1148317	An analysis of the coupling between training set and neighborhood sizes for the k NN classifier We consider the relationship between training set size and the parameter k for the k -Nearest Neighbors ( k NN) classifier. When few examples are available, we observe that accuracy is sensitive to k and that best k tends to increase with training size. We explore the subsequent risk that k tuned on partitions will be suboptimal after aggregation and re-training. This risk is found to be most severe when little data is available. For larger training sizes, accuracy becomes increasingly stable with respect to k and the risk decreases.
1148318	Fact-focused novelty detection: a feasibility study Methods for detecting sentences in an input document set, which are both relevant and novel with respect to an information need, would be of direct benefit to many systems, such as extractive text summarizers. However, satisfactory levels of agreement between judges performing this task manually have yet to demonstrated, leaving researchers to conclude that the task is too subjective. In previous experiments, judges were asked to first identify sentences that are relevant to a general topic, and then to eliminate sentences from the list that do not contain new information. Currently, a new task is proposed, in which annotators perform the same procedure, but within the context of a specific, factual information need. In the experiment, satisfactory levels of agreement between independent annotators were achieved on the first step of identifying sentences containing relevant information relevant. However, the results indicate that judges do not agree on which sentences contain novel information.
1148319	Unity: relevance feedback using user query logs The exponential growth of the Web and the increasing ability of web search engines to index data have led to a problem of plenty. The number of results returned per query is typically in the order of millions of documents for many common queries. Although there is the benefit of added coverage for every query, the problem of ranking these documents and giving the best results gets worse. The problem is even more difficult in case of temporal and ambiguous queries. We try to address this problem using feedback from user query logs. We leverage a technology called Units for generating query refinements which are shown as Also try queries on Yahoo! Search. We consider these refinements as sub-concepts which help define user intent and use them to improve search relevance. The results obtained via live testing on Yahoo! Search are encouraging.
1148320	Improving personalized web search using result diversification We present and evaluate methods for diversifying search results to improve personalized web search. A common personalization approach involves reranking the top N search results such that documents likely to be preferred by the user are presented higher. The usefulness of reranking is limited in part by the number and diversity of results considered. We propose three methods to increase the diversity of the top results and evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.
1148321	Using small XML elements to support relevance Small XML elements are often estimated relevant by the retrieval model but they are not desirable retrieval units. This paper presents a generic model that exploits the information obtained from small elements. We identify relationships between small and relevant elements and use this linking information to reinforce the relevance of other elements before removing the small ones. Our experiments using the INEX testbed show the effectiveness of our approach.
1148322	Give me just one highly relevant document: P-measure We introduce an evaluation metric called P-measure for the task of retrieving <ione highly relevant document. It models user behaviour in practical tasks such as known-item search, and is more stable and sensitive than Reciprocal Rank which cannot handle graded relevance.
1148323	Feature diversity in cluster ensembles for robust document clustering The performance of document clustering systems depends on employing optimal text representations, which are not only difficult to determine beforehand, but also may vary from one clustering problem to another. As a first step towards building robust document clusterers, a strategy based on feature diversity and cluster ensembles is presented in this work. Experiments conducted on a binary clustering problem show that our method is robust to near-optimal model order selection and able to detect constructive interactions between different document representations in the test bed.
1148324	Lightening the load of document smoothing for better language modeling retrieval We hypothesized that language modeling retrieval would improve if we reduced the need for document smoothing to provide an inverse document frequency (IDF) like effect. We created inverse collection frequency (ICF) weighted query models as a tool to partially separate the IDF-like role from document smoothing. Compared to maximum likelihood estimated (MLE) queries, the ICF weighted queries achieved a 6.4% improvement in mean average precision on description queries. The ICF weighted queries performed better with less document smoothing than that required by MLE queries. Language modeling retrieval may benefit from a means to separately incorporate an IDF-like behavior outside of document smoothing.
1148325	The effect of OCR errors on stylistic text classification Recently, interest is growing in non-topical text classification tasks such as genre classification, sentiment analysis, and authorship profiling. We study to what extent OCR errors affect stylistic text classification from scanned documents. We find that even a relatively high level of errors in the OCRed documents does not substantially affect stylistic classification accuracy.
1148326	History repeats itself: repeat queries in Yahoo's logs Thanks to the ubiquity of the Internet search engine search box, users have come to depend on search engines both to find and re-find information. However, re-finding behavior has not been significantly addressed. Here we look at re-finding queries issued to the Yahoo! search engine by 114 users over a year.
1148327	Early precision measures: implications from the downside of blind feedback We report the statistically significant mean impacts of blind feedback, as implemented by 7 participants for the 2003 Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop, on 30 retrieval measures, including several primary recall measures not originally reported. We find that blind feedback was detrimental to measures focused on the first relevant item even when it boosted "early precision" measures such as mean Precision@10, implying that the conventional reporting of ad hoc precision needs enhancement.

1148329	Strict and vague interpretation of XML-retrieval queries Structural hints in XML-retrieval queries can be used to specify both the granularity of the search result (the target element) and where in a document to search (support elements). These hints might be interpreted either strictly or vaguely, but does it matter if an XML search engine interprets these in one way and the user in another? The performance of all runs submitted to INEX 2005 content and structure (CAS) tasks were measured for each of four different interpretations of CAS. Runs that perform well for one interpretation of target elements do so regardless of the interpretation of support elements; but how to interpret the target element does matter. This suggests that to perform well on all CAS queries it is necessary to know how the target structure specification should be interpreted. We extend the NEXI query language to include this, and hypothesize that using this will increase the overall performance of search engines.
1148330	Why structural hints in queries do not help XML-retrieval For many years it has been commonly held that a user who adds structural "hints" to a query will improve precision in an element retrieval search. At INEX 2005 we conducted an experiment to test this assumption. We present the unexpected result that structural hints in queries do not improve precision. An analysis of the topics and the judgments suggests that this is because users are particularly bad at giving structural hints.

1148332	A study of real-time query expansion effectiveness In this poster, we describe the study of an interface technique that provides a list of suggested additional query terms as a searcher types a search query, in effect offering interactive query expansion (IQE) options while the query is formulated. Analysis of the results shows that offering IQE during query formulation leads to better quality initial queries, and an increased uptake of query expansion. These findings have implications for how IQE should be offered in retrieval interfaces.
1148333	A graph-based framework for relation propagation and its application to multi-label learning Label propagation exploits the structure of the unlabeled documents by propagating the label information of the training documents to the unlabeled documents. The limitation with the existing label propagation approaches is that they can only deal with a single type of objects. We propose a framework, named " relation propagation ", that allows for information propagated among multiple types of objects. Empirical studies with multi-label text categorization showed that the proposed algorithm is more effective than several semi-supervised learning algorithms in that it is capable of exploring the correlation among different categories and the structure of unlabeled documents simultaneously.
1148334	Measuring similarity of semi-structured documents with context weights In this work, we study similarity measures for text-centric XML documents based on an extended vector space model, which considers both document content and structure. Experimental results based on a benchmark showed superior performance of the proposed measure over the baseline which ignores structural knowledge of XML documents.
1148335	Incorporating query difference for learning retrieval functions in information retrieval We discuss information retrieval methods that aim at serving a diverse stream of user queries. We propose methods that emphasize the importance of taking into consideration of query difference in learning effective retrieval functions. We formulate the problem as a multi-task learning problem using a risk minimization framework. In particular, we show how to calibrate the empirical risk to incorporate query difference in terms of introducing nuisance parameters in the statistical models, and we also propose an alternating optimization method to simultaneously learn the retrieval function and the nuisance parameters. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods using modeling data extracted from a commercial search engine.
1148336	Concept-based biomedical text retrieval One challenging problem for biomedical text retrieval is to find accurate synonyms or name variants for biomedical entities. In this paper, we propose a new concept-based approach to tackle this problem. In this approach, a set of concepts instead of keywords will be extracted from a query first. Then these concepts will be used for retrieval purpose. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can boost the retrieval performance and it generates very good results on 2005 TREC Genomics data sets.

1148340	Appraisal navigator Much interesting text n the web consists largely of opinionated or evaluative text, as opposed to directly informative text. The new field of 'sentiment analysis' seeks to characterize such aspects of natural language text, as opposed to just the bare facts. We suggest that 'appraisal expression extraction' should be viewed as a fundamental task for sentiment analysis. We define an 'appraisal expression' to be a piece of text expressing some evaluative stance towards a particular object. The task is to find these elements and characterize the type and orientation (positive or negative) of the evaluative stance, as well as its target and possibly its source. Potential applications of these methods include new approaches to the now-traditional tasks of sentiment classification and pinion mining, as well as possibly for adversarial textual analysis and intention detection for intelligence applications.
1148341	A platform for Okapi-based contextual information retrieval We present an extensible java-based platform for contextual retrieval based on the probabilistic information retrieval model. Modules for dual indexes, relevance feedback with blind or machine learning approaches and query expansion with context are integrated into the Okapi system to deal with the contextual information. This platform allows easy extension to include other types of contextual information.
1148342	Project contexts to situate personal information The Personal Project Planner prototype works as an extension to the file manager to provide people with rich-text overlays to their information (folders, files and also email, web pages, notes). Rich-text, document-like project plans can be created which then provide a context in which to create or reference the email messages, electronic documents, web pages, etc. that are needed to complete the plan. The user can later locate an information item such as an email message with reference to the plan (e.g., as an alternative to a mostly context-free search through the inbox or sent mail). The Planner explores a possibility that an effective organization of project-related information can emerge as a natural by-product of efforts to plan and structure the project.

The score is then used to browse the "similar" keyframes in terms of semantic visual features.

1277742	Strategy follows technology In strategic management there has been a debate over many years. Already in 1962 Alfred Chandler had stated: Structure follows Strategy. In the nineteen eighties, Michael Porter modified Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: organizational structure follows strategy, which in turn follows structure. So the question became: what is leading what?. Technology has in this debate been seen as a part of either the structure of the organisation itself, or part of the development of the environment in which the organisation tries to survive by adapting. The notion that technological advancement can also change the paradigmas of organisational strategy-development is new. This has mainly to do with the impact of the technological changes on the workflow and procedures of organisations. Never before they were so profound as in our days. Technological change affects us on different levels of our strategic development. I will give three examples of changes that are occurring or have occurred in "Sound and Vision". The first is the introduction of RFID transmitters in admission rings for the Sound and Vision experience. The second is the setup of a back office media asset management, storage and distribution structure for the Public Broadcasters. The third is the development of the archive towards becoming a Media-Application Service Provider.

1277746	Personalized query expansion for the web The inherent ambiguity of short keyword queries demands for enhanced methods for Web retrieval. In this paper we propose to improve such Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user's Personal Information Repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. We introduce five broad techniques for generating the additional query keywords by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Our extensive empirical analysis under four different scenarios shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Subsequently, we move this personalized search framework one step further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to various features of each query. A separate set of experiments indicates the adaptive algorithms to bring an additional statistically significant improvement over the best static expansion approach.
1277747	Using query contexts in information retrieval User query is an element that specifies an information need, but it is not the only one. Studies in literature have found many contextual factors that strongly influence the interpretation of a query. Recent studies have tried to consider the user's interests by creating a user profile. However, a single profile for a user may not be sufficient for a variety of queries of the user. In this study, we propose to use query-specific contexts instead of user-centric ones, including context around query and context within query . The former specifies the environment of a query such as the domain of interest, while the latter refers to context words within the query, which is particularly useful for the selection of relevant term relations. In this paper, both types of context are integrated in an IR model based on language modeling. Our experiments on several TREC collections show that each of the context factors brings significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
1277748	Towards task-based personal information management evaluations Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and refind information. A feature of PIM research is that many systems have been designed to assist users manage and refind information, but very few have been evaluated. This has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations. The difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal collections; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information; and numerous privacy issues concerning personal information. In this paper we aim to facilitate PIM evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties. In the first part, we present a diary study of information re-finding tasks. The study examines the kind of tasks that require users to refind information and produces a taxonomy of refinding tasks for email messages and web pages. In the second part, we propose a task-based evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using two different methods of task creation.
1277750	Utility-based information distillation over temporally sequenced documents This paper examines a new approach to information distillation over temporally ordered documents, and proposes a novel evaluation scheme for such a framework. It combines the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive filtering, novelty detection and non-redundant passage ranking with respect to long-lasting information needs ("tasks" with multiple queries). Our approach supports fine-grained user feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text, and leverages such information for utility optimization in adaptive settings. For our experiments, we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the TDT4 corpus, with multiple queries per task. Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semi-automatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses. We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty. Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.
1277751	Effective missing data prediction for collaborative filtering Memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender systems, although these approaches all suffer from data sparsity and poor prediction quality problems. Usually, the user-item matrix is quite sparse, which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. This paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors: (1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. First, we use the enhanced Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. Second, we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm, in which information of both users and items is taken into account. In this algorithm, we set the similarity threshold for users and items respectively, and the prediction algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing data or not. We also address how to predict the missing data by employing a combination of user and item information. Finally, empirical studies on dataset MovieLens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data sparsity.
1277752	Efficient bayesian hierarchical user modeling for recommendation system A content-based personalized recommendation system learns user specific profiles from user feedback so that it can deliver information tailored to each individual user's interest. A system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model. Learning the model parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive. The commonly used EM algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in IR applications. This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user profiles. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user data from Netflix and MovieLens.
1277754	Robust test collections for retrieval evaluation Low-cost methods for acquiring relevance judgments can be a boon to researchers who need to evaluate new retrieval tasks or topics but do not have the resources to make thousands of judgments. While these judgments are very useful for a one-time evaluation, it is not clear that they can be trusted when re-used to evaluate new systems. In this work, we formally define what it means for judgments to be reusable: the confidence in an evaluation of new systems can be accurately assessed from an existing set of relevance judgments. We then present a method for augmenting a set of relevance judgments with relevance estimates that require no additional assessor effort. Using this method practically guarantees reusability: with as few as five judgments per topic taken from only two systems, we can reliably evaluate a larger set of ten systems. Even the smallest sets of judgments can be useful for evaluation of new systems.
1277755	Reliable information retrieval evaluation with incomplete and biased judgements Information retrieval evaluation based on the pooling method is inherently biased against systems that did not contribute to the pool of judged documents. This may distort the results obtained about the relative quality of the systems evaluated and thus lead to incorrect conclusions about the performance of a particular ranking technique. We examine the magnitude of this effect and explore how it can be countered by automatically building an unbiased set of judgements from the original, biased judgements obtained through pooling. We compare the performance of this method with other approaches to the problem of incomplete judgements, such as bpref, and show that the proposed method leads to higher evaluation accuracy, especially if the set of manual judgements is rich in documents, but highly biased against some systems.
1277756	Alternatives to Bpref Recently, a number of TREC tracks have adopted a retrieval effectiveness metric called bpref which has been designed for evaluation environments with incomplete relevance data. A graded-relevance version of this metric called rpref has also been proposed. However, we show that the application of Q-measure, normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) or Average Precision (AveP)to condensed lists , obtained by ?ltering out all unjudged documents from the original ranked lists, is actually a better solution to the incompleteness problem than bpref. Furthermore, we show that the use of graded relevance boosts the robustness of IR evaluation to incompleteness and therefore that Q-measure and nDCG based on condensed lists are the best choices. To this end, we use four graded-relevance test collections from NTCIR to compare ten different IR metrics in terms of system ranking stability and pairwise discriminative power.
1277758	An interactive algorithm for asking and incorporating feature feedback into support vector machines Standard machine learning techniques typically require ample training data in the form of labeled instances. In many situations it may be too tedious or costly to obtain sufficient labeled data for adequate classifier performance. However, in text classification, humans can easily guess the relevance of features, that is, words that are indicative of a topic, thereby enabling the classifier to focus its feature weights more appropriately in the absence of sufficient labeled data. We will describe an algorithm for tandem learning that begins with a couple of labeled instances, and then at each iteration recommends features and instances for a human to label. Tandem learning using an "oracle" results in much better performance than learning on only features or only instances. We find that humans can emulate the oracle to an extent that results in performance (accuracy) comparable to that of the oracle. Our unique experimental design helps factor out system error from human error, leading to a better understanding of when and why interactive feature selection works.
1277759	Learn from web search logs to organize search results Effective organization of search results is critical for improving the utility of any search engine. Clustering search results is an effective way to organize search results, which allows a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly. However, two deficiencies of this approach make it not always work well: (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily correspond to the interesting aspects of a topic from the user's perspective; and (2) the cluster labels generated are not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster. In this paper, we propose to address these two deficiencies by (1) learning "interesting aspects" of a topic from Web search logs and organizing search results accordingly; and (2) generating more meaningful cluster labels using past query words entered by users. We evaluate our proposed method on a commercial search engine log data. Compared with the traditional methods of clustering search results, our method can give better result organization and more meaningful labels.
1277760	Regularized clustering for documents In recent years, document clustering has been receiving more and more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization, automatictopic extraction, and fast information retrieval or filtering. In this paper, we propose a novel method for clustering documents using regularization. Unlike traditional globally regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer. So we call our algorithm Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR) . We will show that the cluster memberships of the documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix, which can be efficiently solved by iterative methods. Finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.
1277762	Towards automatic extraction of event and place semantics from flickr tags We describe an approach for extracting semantics of tags, unstructured text-labels assigned to resources on the Web, based on each tag's usage patterns. In particular, we focus on the problem of extracting place and event semantics for tags that are assigned to photos on Flickr, a popular photo sharing website that supports time and location (latitude/longitude) metadata. We analyze two methods inspired by well-known burst-analysis techniques and one novel method: Scale-structure Identification. We evaluate the methods on a subset of Flickr data, and show that our Scale-structure Identification method outperforms the existing techniques. The approach and methods described in this work can be used in other domains such as geo-annotated web pages, where text terms can be extracted and associated with usage patterns.
1277763	Hierarchical classification for automatic image annotation In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been proposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-level image annotation automatically. First, the semantic gap between the low-level computable visual features and users' real information needs is partitioned into four smaller gaps, and multiple approachesallare proposed to bridge these smaller gaps more effectively. To learn more reliable contextual relationships between the atomic image concepts and the co-appearances of salient objects, a multi-modal boosting algorithm is proposed. To enable hierarchical image classification and avoid inter-level error transmission, a hierarchical boosting algorithm is proposed by incorporating concept ontology and multi-task learning to achieve hierarchical image classifier training with automatic error recovery. To bridge the gap between the computable image concepts and the users' real information needs, a novel hyperbolic visualization framework is seamlessly incorporated to enable intuitive query specification and evaluation by acquainting the users with a good global view of large-scale image collections. Our experiments on large-scale image databases have also obtained very positive results.
1277764	Laplacian optimal design for image retrieval Relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) performance. It solicits the user's relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the CBIR systems. The user's labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images. However, the top returnedimages may not be the most informative ones. The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Laplacian Optimal Design (LOD), for relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on aregression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space. Specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (or, labels) are close as well. By constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph Laplacian. We discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images, which gives us the most amount of information. Experimental results on Corel database suggest that theproposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback image retrieval.
1277766	Fast generation of result snippets in web search The presentation of query biased document snippets as part of results pages presented by search engines has become an expectation of search engine users. In this paper we explore the algorithms and data structures required as part of a search engine to allow efficient generation of query biased snippets. We begin by proposing and analysing a document compression method that reduces snippet generation time by 58% over a baseline using the zlib compression library. These experiments reveal that finding documents on secondary storage dominates the total cost of generating snippets, and so caching documents in RAM is essential for a fast snippet generation process. Using simulation, we examine snippet generation performance for different size RAM caches. Finally we propose and analyse document reordering and compaction, revealing a scheme that increases the number of document cache hits with only a marginal affect on snippet quality. This scheme effectively doubles the number of documents that can fit in a fixed size cache.
1277767	The influence of caption features on clickthrough patterns in web search Web search engines present lists of captions, comprising title, snippet, and URL, to help users decide which search results to visit. Understanding the influence of features of these captions on Web search behavior may help validate algorithms and guidelines for their improved generation. In this paper we develop a methodology to use clickthrough logs from a commercial search engine to study user behavior when interacting with search result captions. The findings of our study suggest that relatively simple caption features such as the presence of all terms query terms, the readability of the snippet, and the length of the URL shown in the caption, can significantly influence users' Web search behavior.
1277768	CollabSum: exploiting multiple document clustering for collaborative single document summarizations Almost all existing methods conduct the summarization tasks for single documents separately without interactions for each document under the assumption that the documents are considered independent of each other. This paper proposes a novel framework called CollabSum for collaborative single document summarizations by making use of mutual influences of multiple documents within a cluster context. In this study, CollabSum is implemented by first employing the clustering algorithm to obtain appropriate document clusters and then exploiting the graph-ranking based algorithm for collaborative document summarizations within each cluster. Both the with-document and cross-document relationships between sentences are incorporated in the algorithm. Experiments on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed approach. Different clustering algorithms have been investigated and we find that the summarization performance relies positively on the quality of document cluster.
1277770	Information re-retrieval: repeat queries in Yahoo's logs People often repeat Web searches, both to find new information on topics they have previously explored and to re-find information they have seen in the past. The query associated with a repeat search may differ from the initial query but can nonetheless lead to clicks on the same results. This paper explores repeat search behavior through the analysis of a one-year Web query log of 114 anonymous users and a separate controlled survey of an additional 119 volunteers. Our study demonstrates that as many as 40% of all queries are re-finding queries. Re-finding appears to be an important behavior for search engines to explicitly support, and we explore how this can be done. We demonstrate that changes to search engine results can hinder re-finding, and provide a way to automatically detect repeat searches and predict repeat clicks.
1277771	Studying the use of popular destinations to enhance web search interaction We present a novel Web search interaction feature which, for a given query, provides links to websites frequently visited by other users with similar information needs. These popular destinations complement traditional search results, allowing direct navigation to authoritative resources for the query topic. Destinations are identified using the history of search and browsing behavior of many users over an extended time period, whose collective behavior provides a basis for computing source authority. We describe a user study which compared the suggestion of destinations with the previously proposed suggestion of related queries, as well as with traditional, unaided Web search. Results show that search enhanced by destination suggestions outperforms other systems for exploratory tasks, with best performance obtained from mining past user behavior at query-level granularity.
1277772	Neighborhood restrictions in geographic IR Geographic information retrieval (GIR) systems allow users to specify a geographic context, in addition to a more traditional query, enabling the system to pinpoint interesting search results whose relevancy is location-dependent. In particular local search services have become a widely used mechanism to find businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, which satisfy a geographical restriction. Unfortunately, many useful types of geographic restrictions are currently not supported in these systems, including restrictions that specify the neighborhood in which the business should be located. As the boundaries of city neighborhoods are not readily available, automated techniques to construct representations of the spatial extent of neighborhoods are required to support this kind of restrictions. In this paper, we propose such a technique, using fuzzy footprints to cope with the inherent vagueness of most neighborhood boundaries, and we provide experimental results that demonstrate the potential of our technique in a local search setting.
1277774	Efficient document retrieval in main memory Disk access performance is a major bottleneck in traditional information retrieval systems. Compared to system memory, disk bandwidth is poor, and seek times are worse. We circumvent this problem by considering query evaluation strategies in main memory. We show how new accumulator trimming techniques combined with inverted list skipping can produce extremely high performance retrieval systems without resorting to methods that may harm effectiveness. We evaluate our techniques using Galago, a new retrieval system designed for efficient query processing. Our system achieves a 69% improvement in query throughput over previous methods.
1277775	The impact of caching on search engines In this paper we study the trade-offs in designing efficient caching systems for Web search engines. We explore the impact of different approaches, such as static vs. dynamic caching, and caching query results vs.caching posting lists. Using a query log spanning a whole year we explore the limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching posting lists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query answers. We propose a new algorithm for static caching of posting lists, which outperforms previous methods. We also study the problem of finding the optimal way to split the static cache between answers and posting lists. Finally, we measure how the changes in the query log affect the effectiveness of static caching, given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time. Our results and observations are applicable to different levels of the data-access hierarchy, for instance, for a memory/disk layer or a broker/remote server layer.
1277776	Pruning policies for two-tiered inverted index with correctness guarantee The Web search engines maintain large-scale inverted indexes which are queried thousands of times per second by users eager for information. In order to cope with the vast amounts of query loads, search engines prune their index to keep documents that are likely to be returned as top results, and use this pruned index to compute the first batches of results. While this approach can improve performance by reducing the size of the index, if we compute the top results only from the pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in the result quality: if a document should be in the top results but was not included in the pruned index, it will be placed behind the results computed from the pruned index. Given the fierce competition in the online search market, this phenomenon is clearly undesirable. In this paper, we study how we can avoid any degradation of result quality due to the pruning-based performance optimization, while still realizing most of its benefit. Our contribution is a number of modifications in the pruning techniques for creating the pruned index and a new result computation algorithm that guarantees that the top-matching pages are always placed at the top search results, even though we are computing the first batch from the pruned index most of the time. We also show how to determine the optimal size of a pruned index and we experimentally evaluate our algorithms on a collection of 130 million Web pages.
1277778	Topic segmentation with shared topic detection and alignment of multiple documents Topic detection and tracking and topic segmentation play an important role in capturing the local and sequential information of documents. Previous work in this area usually focuses on single documents, although similar multiple documents are available in many domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual information (MI) and weighted mutual information (WMI) that is a combination of MI and term weights. The basic idea is that the optimal segmentation maximizes MI (or WMI). Our approach can detect shared topics among documents. It can find the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among documents at the same time. It also can handle single-document segmentation as a special case of the multi-document segmentation and alignment. Our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term weights based on entropy learned from multiple documents. Our experimental results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single-document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi-document segmentation. Utilizing information from multiple documents can tremendously improve the performance of topic segmentation, and using WMI is even better than using MI for the multi-document segmentation.
1277779	Analyzing feature trajectories for event detection We consider the problem of analyzing word trajectories in both time and frequency domains, with the specific goal of identifying important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic words. A set of words with identical trends can be grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely un-supervised manner. The document frequency of each word across time is treated like a time series, where each element is the document frequency - inverse document frequency (DFIDF) score at one time point. In this paper, we 1) first applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different event characteristics: important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic; 2) modeled aperiodic features with Gaussian density and periodic features with Gaussian mixture densities, and subsequently detected each feature's burst by the truncated Gaussian approach; 3) proposed an unsupervised greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events. All of the above methods can be applied to time series data in general. We extensively evaluated our methods on the 1-year Reuters News Corpus [3] and showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic and periodic events.
1277780	New event detection based on indexing-tree and named entity New Event Detection (NED) aims at detecting from one or multiple streams of news stories that which one is reported on a new event (i.e. not reported previously). With the overwhelming volume of news available today, there is an increasing need for a NED system which is able to detect new events more efficiently and accurately. In this paper we propose a new NED model to speed up the NED task by using news indexing-tree dynamically. Moreover, based on the observation that terms of different types have different effects for NED task, two term reweighting approaches are proposed to improve NED accuracy. In the first approach, we propose to adjust term weights dynamically based on previous story clusters and in the second approach, we propose to employ statistics on training data to learn the named entity reweighting model for each class of stories. Experimental results on two Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) datasets TDT2 and TDT3 show that the proposed model can improve both efficiency and accuracy of NED task significantly, compared to the baseline system and other existing systems.
1277782	Multiple-signal duplicate detection for search evaluation We consider the problem of duplicate document detection for search evaluation. Given a query and a small number of web results for that query, we show how to detect duplicate web documents with precision ~0.91 and recall ~77. In contrast, Charikar's algorithm, designed for duplicate detection in an indexing pipeline, achieves precision ~0.91 but with a recall of ~0.58. Our improvement in recall while maintaining high precision comes from combining three ideas. First, because we are only concerned with duplicate detection among results for the same query, the number of pairwise comparisons is small. Therefore we can afford to compute multiple pairwise signals for each pair of documents. A model learned with standard machine-learning techniques improves recall to ~0.68 with precision ~0.90. Second, most duplicate detection has focused on text analysis of the HTML contents of a document. In some web pages the HTML is not a good indicator of the final contents of the page. We use extended fetching techniques to fill in frames and execute Java script. Including signals based on our richer fetches further improves the recall to ~0.75 and the precision to ~0.91. Finally, we also explore using signals based on the query. Comparing contextual snippets based on the richer fetches improves the recall to ~0.77. We show that the overall accuracy of this final model approaches that of human judges.
1277783	Robust classification of rare queries using web knowledge We propose a methodology for building a practical robust query classification system that can identify thousands of query classes with reasonable accuracy, while dealing in real-time with the query volume of a commercial web search engine. We use a blind feedback technique: given a query, we determine its topic by classifying the web search results retrieved by the query. Motivated by the needs of search advertising, we primarily focus on rare queries, which are the hardest from the point of view of machine learning, yet in aggregation account for a considerable fraction of search engine traffic. Empirical evaluation confirms that our methodology yields a considerably higher classification accuracy than previously reported. We believe that the proposed methodology will lead to better matching of online ads to rare queries and overall to a better user experience.
1277784	Random walks on the click graph Search engines can record which documents were clicked for which query, and use these query-document pairs as "soft" relevance judgments. However, compared to the true judgments, click logs give noisy and sparse relevance information. We apply a Markov random walk model to a large click log, producing a probabilistic ranking of documents for a given query. A key advantage of the model is its ability to retrieve relevant documents that have not yet been clicked for that query and rank those effectively. We conduct experiments on click logs from image search, comparing our ("backward") random walk model to a different ("forward") random walk, varying parameters such as walk length and self-transition probability. The most effective combination is a long backward walk with high self-transition probability.
1277786	Supporting multiple information-seeking strategies in a single system framework This paper reports on an experiment comparing the retrieval effectiveness of an interactive information retrieval (IIR) system which adapts to support different information seeking strategies, with that of a standard baseline IIR system. The experiment, with 32 subjects each searching on 8 different topics, indicates that using the integrated IIR system resulted in significantly better performance, including user satisfaction with search results, significantly more effective interaction, and significantly better usability than using the baseline system.
1277787	Investigating the querying and browsing behavior of advanced search engine users One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone. In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search. The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced. Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.
1277788	Term feedback for information retrieval with language models In this paper we study term-based feedback for information retrieval in the language modeling approach. With term feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without interaction with feedback documents, taking full control of the query expansion process. We propose a cluster-based method for selecting terms to present to the user for judgment, as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query language models from user term feedback. Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve comparable performance to relevance feedback. They are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top.
1277790	A support vector method for optimizing average precision Machine learning is commonly used to improve ranked retrieval systems. Due to computational difficulties, few learning techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean average precision (MAP), despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems. Existing approaches optimizing MAP either do not find a globally optimal solution, or are computationally expensive. In contrast, we present a general SVM learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally optimal solution to a straightforward relaxation of MAP. We evaluate our approach using the TREC 9 and TREC 10 Web Track corpora (WT10g), comparing against SVMs optimized for accuracy and ROCArea. In most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements in MAP scores.
1277791	Ranking with multiple hyperplanes The central problem for many applications in Information Retrieval is ranking and learning to rank is considered as a promising approach for addressing the issue. Ranking SVM, for example, is a state-of-the-art method for learning to rank and has been empirically demonstrated to be effective. In this paper, we study the issue of learning to rank, particularly the approach of using SVM techniques to perform the task. We point out that although Ranking SVM is advantageous, it still has shortcomings. Ranking SVM employs a single hyperplane in the feature space as the model for ranking, which is too simple to tackle complex ranking problems. Furthermore, the training of Ranking SVM is also computationally costly. In this paper, we look at an alternative approach to Ranking SVM, which we call "Multiple Hyperplane Ranker" (MHR), and make comparisons between the two approaches. MHR takes the divide-and-conquer strategy. It employs multiple hyperplanes to rank instances and finally aggregates the ranking results given by the hyperplanes. MHR contains Ranking SVM as a special case, and MHR can overcome the shortcomings which Ranking SVM suffers from. Experimental results on two information retrieval datasets show that MHR can outperform Ranking SVM in ranking.
1277792	A regression framework for learning ranking functions using relative relevance judgments Effective ranking functions are an essential part of commercial search engines. We focus on developing a regression framework for learning ranking functions for improving relevance of search engines serving diverse streams of user queries. We explore supervised learning methodology from machine learning, and we distinguish two types of relevance judgments used as the training data: 1) absolute relevance judgments arising from explicit labeling of search results; and 2) relative relevance judgments extracted from user click throughs of search results or converted from the absolute relevance judgments. We propose a novel optimization framework emphasizing the use of relative relevance judgments. The main contribution is the development of an algorithm based on regression that can be applied to objective functions involving preference data, i.e., data indicating that a document is more relevant than another with respect to a query. Experimental results are carried out using data sets obtained from a commercial search engine. Our results show significant improvements of our proposed methods over some existing methods.
1277794	An exploration of proximity measures in information retrieval In most existing retrieval models, documents are scored primarily based on various kinds of term statistics such as within-document frequencies, inverse document frequencies, and document lengths. Intuitively, the proximity of matched query terms in a document can also be exploited to promote scores of documents in which the matched query terms are close to each other. Such a proximity heuristic, however, has been largely under-explored in the literature; it is unclear how we can model proximity and incorporate a proximity measure into an existing retrieval model. In this paper,we systematically explore the query term proximity heuristic. Specifically, we propose and study the effectiveness of five different proximity measures, each modeling proximity from a different perspective. We then design two heuristic constraints and use them to guide us in incorporating the proposed proximity measures into an existing retrieval model. Experiments on five standard TREC test collections show that one of the proposed proximity measures is indeed highly correlated with document relevance, and by incorporating it into the KL-divergence language model and the Okapi BM25 model, we can significantly improve retrieval performance.
1277795	Estimation and use of uncertainty in pseudo-relevance feedback Existing pseudo-relevance feedback methods typically perform averaging over the top-retrieved documents, but ignore an important statistical dimension: the risk or variance associated with either the individual document models, or their combination. Treating the baseline feedback method as a black box, and the output feedback model as a random variable, we estimate a posterior distribution for the feed-back model by resampling a given query's top-retrieved documents, using the posterior mean or mode as the enhanced feedback model. We then perform model combination over several enhanced models, each based on a slightly modified query sampled from the original query. We find that resampling documents helps increase individual feedback model precision by removing noise terms, while sampling from the query improves robustness (worst-case performance) by emphasizing terms related to multiple query aspects. The result is a meta-feedback algorithm that is both more robust and more precise than the original strong baseline method.
1277796	Latent concept expansion using markov random fields Query expansion, in the form of pseudo-relevance feedback or relevance feedback, is a common technique used to improve retrieval effectiveness. Most previous approaches have ignored important issues, such as the role of features and the importance of modeling term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a robust query expansion technique based onthe Markov random field model for information retrieval. The technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expansion. Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques. We evaluate our technique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique. Our model demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several TREC data sets. We also describe how our technique can be used to generate meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query suggestion/reformulation.
1277797	A study of Poisson query generation model for information retrieval Many variants of language models have been proposed for information retrieval. Most existing models are based on multinomial distribution and would score documents based on query likelihood computed based on a query generation probabilistic model. In this paper, we propose and study a new family of query generation models based on Poisson distribution. We show that while in their simplest forms, the new family of models and the existing multinomial models are equivalent. However, based on different smoothing methods, the two families of models behave differently. We show that the Poisson model has several advantages, including naturally accommodating per-term smoothing and modeling accurate background more efficiently. We present several variants of the new model corresponding to different smoothing methods, and evaluate them on four representative TREC test collections. The results show that while their basic models perform comparably, the Poisson model can out perform multinomial model with per-term smoothing. The performance can be further improved with two-stage smoothing.
1277799	Deconstructing nuggets: the stability and reliability of complex question answering evaluation A methodology based on "information nuggets" has recently emerged as the de facto standard by which answers to complex questions are evaluated. After several implementations in the TREC question answering tracks, the community has gained a better understanding of its many characteristics. This paper focuses on one particular aspect of the evaluation: the human assignment of nuggets to answer strings, which serves as the basis of the F-score computation. As a byproduct of the TREC 2006 ciQA task, identical answer strings were independently evaluated twice, which allowed us to assess the consistency of human judgments. Based on these results, we explored simulations of assessor behavior that provide a method to quantify scoring variations. Understanding these variations in turn lets researchers be more confident in their comparisons of systems.
1277800	Interesting nuggets and their impact on definitional question answering Current approaches to identifying definitional sentences in the context of Question Answering mainly involve the use of linguistic or syntactic patterns to identify informative nuggets. This is insufficient as they do not address the novelty factor that a definitional nugget must also possess. This paper proposes to address the deficiency by building a "Human Interest Model" from external knowledge. It is hoped that such a model will allow the computation of human interest in the sentence with respect to the topic. We compare and contrast our model with current definitional question answering models to show that interestingness plays an important factor in definitional question answering.
1277801	A probabilistic graphical model for joint answer ranking in question answering Graphical models have been applied to various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks in the recent literature. In this paper, we apply a probabilistic graphical model for answer ranking in question answering. This model estimates the joint probability of correctness of all answer candidates, from which the probability of correctness of an individual candidate can be inferred. The joint prediction model can estimate both the correctness of individual answers as well as their correlations, which enables a list of accurate and comprehensive answers. This model was compared with a logistic regression model which directly estimates the probability of correctness of each individual answer candidate. An extensive set of empirical results based on TREC questions demonstrates the effectiveness of the joint model for answer ranking. Furthermore, we combine the joint model with the logistic regression model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of answer ranking.
1277802	Structured retrieval for question answering Bag-of-words retrieval is popular among Question Answering (QA) system developers, but it does not support constraint checking and ranking on the linguistic and semantic information of interest to the QA system. We present anapproach to retrieval for QA, applying structured retrieval techniques to the types of text annotations that QA systems use. We demonstrate that the structured approach can retrieve more relevant results, more highly ranked, compared with bag-of-words, on a sentence retrieval task. We also characterize the extent to which structured retrieval effectiveness depends on the quality of the annotations.
1277804	On the robustness of relevance measures with incomplete judgments We investigate the robustness of three widely used IR relevance measures for large data collections with incomplete judgments. The relevance measures we consider are the bpref measure introduced by Buckley and Voorhees [7], the inferred average precision (infAP) introduced by Aslam and Yilmaz [4], and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) measure introduced by Järvelin and Kekäläinen [8]. Our main results show that NDCG consistently performs better than both bpref and infAP. The experiments are performed on standard TREC datasets, under different levels of incompleteness of judgments, and using two different evaluation methods, namely, the Kendall correlation measures order between system rankings and pairwise statistical significance testing; the latter may be of independent interest.
1277805	Test theory for assessing IR test collections How good is an IR test collection? A series of papers in recent years has addressed the question by empirically enumerating the consistency of performance comparisons using alternate subsets of the collection. In this paper we propose using Test Theory, which is based on analysis of variance and is specifically designed to assess test collections. Using the method, we not only can measure test reliability after the fact, but we can estimate the test collection's reliability before it is even built or used. We can also determine an optimal allocation of resources before the fact, e.g. whether to invest in more judges or queries. The method, which is in widespread use in the field of educational testing, complements data-driven approaches to assessing test collections. Whereas the data-driven method focuses on test results, test theory focuses on test designs. It offers unique practical results, as well as insights about the variety and implications of alternative test designs.
1277806	Strategic system comparisons via targeted relevance judgments Relevance judgments are used to compare text retrieval systems. Given a collection of documents and queries, and a set of systems being compared, a standard approach to forming judgments is to manually examine all documents that are highly ranked by any of the systems. However, not all of these relevance judgments provide the same benefit to the final result, particularly if the aim is to identify which systems are best, rather than to fully order them. In this paper we propose new experimental methodologies that can significantly reduce the volume of judgments required in system comparisons. Using rank-biased precision, a recently proposed effectiveness measure, we show that judging around 200 documents for each of 50 queries in a TREC-scale system evaluation containing over 100 runs is sufficient to identify the best systems.
1277808	FRank: a ranking method with fidelity loss Ranking problem is becoming important in many fields, especially in information retrieval (IR). Many machine learning techniques have been proposed for ranking problem, such as RankSVM, RankBoost, and RankNet. Among them, RankNet, which is based on a probabilistic ranking framework, is leading to promising results and has been applied to a commercial Web search engine. In this paper we conduct further study on the probabilistic ranking framework and provide a novel loss function named fidelity loss for measuring loss of ranking. The fidelity loss notonly inherits effective properties of the probabilistic ranking framework in RankNet, but possesses new properties that are helpful for ranking. This includes the fidelity loss obtaining zero for each document pair, and having a finite upper bound that is necessary for conducting query-level normalization. We also propose an algorithm named FRank based on a generalized additive model for the sake of minimizing the fedelity loss and learning an effective ranking function. We evaluated the proposed algorithm for two datasets: TREC dataset and real Web search dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed FRank algorithm outperforms other learning-based ranking methods on both conventional IR problem and Web search.
1277809	AdaRank: a boosting algorithm for information retrieval In this paper we address the issue of learning to rank for document retrieval. In the task, a model is automatically created with some training data and then is utilized for ranking of documents. The goodness of a model is usually evaluated with performance measures such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). Ideally a learning algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data. Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures. For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking models by minimizing classification errors on instance pairs. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures. Our algorithm, referred to as AdaRank, repeatedly constructs 'weak rankers' on the basis of reweighted training data and finally linearly combines the weak rankers for making ranking predictions. We prove that the training process of AdaRank is exactly that of enhancing the performance measure used. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that AdaRank significantly outperforms the baseline methods of BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost.
1277810	A combined component approach for finding collection-adapted ranking functions based on genetic programming In this paper, we propose a new method to discover collection-adapted ranking functions based on Genetic Programming (GP). Our Combined Component Approach (CCA)is based on the combination of several term-weighting components (i.e.,term frequency, collection frequency, normalization) extracted from well-known ranking functions. In contrast to related work, the GP terminals in our CCA are not based on simple statistical information of a document collection, but on meaningful, effective, and proven components. Experimental results show that our approach was able to outper form standard TF-IDF, BM25 and another GP-based approach in two different collections. CCA obtained improvements in mean average precision up to 40.87% for the TREC-8 collection, and 24.85% for the WBR99 collection (a large Brazilian Web collection), over the baseline functions. The CCA evolution process also was able to reduce the overtraining, commonly found in machine learning methods, especially genetic programming, and to converge faster than the other GP-based approach used for comparison.
1277811	Feature selection for ranking Ranking is a very important topic in information retrieval. While algorithms for learning ranking models have been intensively studied, this is not the case for feature selection, despite of its importance. The reality is that many feature selection methods used in classification are directly applied to ranking. We argue that because of the striking differences between ranking and classification, it is better to develop different feature selection methods for ranking. To this end, we propose a new feature selection method in this paper. Specifically, for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances, and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure or a loss function as the importance of the feature. We also define the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the similarity between them. Based on the definitions, we formulate the feature selection issue as an optimization problem, for which it is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and minimum total similarity scores. We also demonstrate how to solve the optimization problem in an efficient way. We have tested the effectiveness of our feature selection method on two information retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. Experimental results show that our method can outperform traditional feature selection methods for the ranking task.
1277813	Relaxed online SVMs for spam filtering Spam is a key problem in electronic communication, including large-scale email systems and the growing number of blogs. Content-based filtering is one reliable method of combating this threat in its various forms, but some academic researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam. The former have advocated the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for content-based filtering, as this machine learning methodology gives state-of-the-art performance for text classification. However, similar performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam filtering. Additionally, practitioners cite the high cost of SVMs as reason to prefer faster (if less statistically robust) Bayesian methods. In this paper, we offer a resolution to this controversy. First, we show that online SVMs indeed give state-of-the-art classification performance on online spam filtering on large benchmark data sets. Second, we show that nearly equivalent performance may be achieved by a Relaxed Online SVM (ROSVM) at greatly reduced computational cost. Our results are experimentally verified on email spam, blog spam, and splog detection tasks.
1277814	Know your neighbors: web spam detection using the web topology Web spam can significantly deteriorate the quality of search engine results. Thus there is a large incentive for commercial search engines to detect spam pages efficiently and accurately. In this paper we present a spam detection system that combines link-based and content-based features, and uses the topology of the Web graph by exploiting the link dependencies among the Web pages. We find that linked hosts tend to belong to the same class: either both are spam or both are non-spam. We demonstrate three methods of incorporating the Web graph topology into the predictions obtained by our base classifier: (i) clustering the host graph, and assigning the label of all hosts in the cluster by majority vote, (ii) propagating the predicted labels to neighboring hosts, and (iii) using the predicted labels of neighboring hosts as new features and retraining the classifier. The result is an accurate system for detecting Web spam, tested on a large and public dataset, using algorithms that can be applied in practice to large-scale Web data.
1277815	DiffusionRank: a possible penicillin for web spamming While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated. To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank. DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph. Theoretically we show that DiffusionRank can serve as a generalization of PageRank when the heat diffusion co-efficient ? tends to infinity. In such a case 1=?= 0, DiffusionRank (PageRank) has low ability of anti-manipulation. When ? = 0, DiffusionRank obtains the highest ability of anti-manipulation, but in such a case, the web structure is completely ignored. Consequently, ? is an interesting factor that can control the balance between the ability of preserving the original Web and the ability of reducing the effect of manipulation. It is found empirically that, when ? = 1, DiffusionRank has a Penicillin-like effect on the link manipulation. Moreover, DiffusionRank can be employed to find group-to-group relations on the Web, to divide the Web graph into several parts, and to find link communities. Experimental results show that the DiffusionRank algorithm achieves the above mentioned advantages as expected.
1277817	Towards musical query-by-semantic-description using the CAL500 data set Query-by-semantic-description (QBSD)is a natural paradigm for retrieving content from large databases of music. A major impediment to the development of good QBSD systems for music information retrieval has been the lack of a cleanly-labeled, publicly-available, heterogeneous data set of songs and associated annotations. We have collected the Computer Audition Lab 500-song (CAL500) data set by having humans listen to and annotate songs using a survey designed to capture 'semantic associations' between music and words. We adapt the supervised multi-class labeling (SML) model, which has shown good performance on the task of image retrieval, and use the CAL500 data to learn a model for music retrieval. The model parameters are estimated using the weighted mixture hierarchies expectation-maximization algorithm which has been specifically designed to handle real-valued semantic association between words and songs, rather than binary class labels. The output of the SML model, a vector of class-conditional probabilities, can be interpreted as a semantic multinomial distribution over a vocabulary. By also representing a semantic query as a query multinomial distribution, we can quickly rank order the songs in a database based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the query multinomial and each song's semantic multinomial. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our SML model can both annotate a novel song with meaningful words and retrieve relevant songs given a multi-word, text-based query.
1277818	A music search engine built upon audio-based and web-based similarity measures An approach is presented to automatically build a search engine for large-scale music collections that can be queried through natural language. While existing approaches depend on explicit manual annotations and meta-data assigned to the individual audio pieces, we automatically derive descriptions by making use of methods from Web Retrieval and Music Information Retrieval. Based on the ID3 tags of a collection of mp3 files, we retrieve relevant Web pages via Google queries and use the contents of these pages to characterize the music pieces and represent them by term vectors. By incorporating complementary information about acous tic similarity we are able to both reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and improve the performance of retrieval, i.e. the quality of the results. Furthermore, the usage of audio similarity allows us to also characterize audio pieces when there is no associated information found on the Web.
1277820	Building simulated queries for known-item topics: an analysis using six european languages There has been increased interest in the use of simulated queries for evaluation and estimation purposes in Information Retrieval. However, there are still many unaddressed issues regarding their usage and impact on evaluation because their quality, in terms of retrieval performance, is unlike real queries. In this paper, wefocus on methods for building simulated known-item topics and explore their quality against real known-item topics. Using existing generation models as our starting point, we explore factors which may influence the generation of the known-item topic. Informed by this detailed analysis (on six European languages) we propose a model with improved document and term selection properties, showing that simulated known-item topics can be generated that are comparable to real known-item topics. This is a significant step towards validating the potential usefulness of simulated queries: for evaluation purposes, and becausebuilding models of querying behavior provides a deeper insight into the querying process so that better retrieval mechanisms can be developed to support the user.
1277821	Cross-lingual query suggestion using query logs of different languages Query suggestion aims to suggest relevant queries for a given query, which help users better specify their information needs. Previously, the suggested terms are mostly in the same language of the input query. In this paper, we extend it to cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS): for a query in one language, we suggest similar or relevant queries in other languages. This is very important to scenarios of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and cross-lingual keyword bidding for search engine advertisement. Instead of relying on existing query translation technologies for CLQS, we present an effective means to map the input query of one language to queries of the other language in the query log. Important monolingual and cross-lingual information such as word translation relations and word co-occurrence statistics, etc. are used to estimate the cross-lingual query similarity with a discriminative model. Benchmarks show that the resulting CLQS system significantly out performs a baseline system based on dictionary-based query translation. Besides, the resulting CLQS is tested with French to English CLIR tasks on TREC collections. The results demonstrate higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods.
1277823	Hits on the web: how does it compare? This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, when used in combination with a state-of-the-art text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text. We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements. The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges. We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree. The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm. Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.
1277824	Hits hits TREC: exploring IR evaluation results with network analysis We propose a novel method of analysing data gathered fromTREC or similar information retrieval evaluation experiments. We define two normalized versions of average precision, that we use to construct a weighted bipartite graph of TREC systems and topics. We analyze the meaning of well known - and somewhat generalized - indicators fromsocial network analysis on the Systems-Topics graph. We apply this method to an analysis of TREC 8 data; amongthe results, we find that authority measures systems performance, that hubness of topics reveals that some topics are better than others at distinguishing more or less effective systems, that with current measures a system that wants to be effective in TREC needs to be effective on easy topics, and that by using different effectiveness measures this is no longer the case.
1277825	Combining content and link for classification using matrix factorization The world wide web contains rich textual contents that areinterconnected via complex hyperlinks. This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample. It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure. The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage. Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features. Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors. Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.
1277827	Federated text retrieval from uncooperative overlapped collections In federated text retrieval systems, the query is sent to multiple collections at the same time. The results returned by collections are gathered and ranked by a central broker that presents them to the user. It is usually assumed that the collections have little overlap. However, in practice collections may share many common documents as either exact or near duplicates, potentially leading to high numbers of duplicates in the final results. Considering the natural band width restrictions and efficiency issues of federated search, sendingqueries to redundant collections leads to unnecessary costs. We propose a novel method for estimating the rate of over-lap among collections based on sampling. Then, using theestimated overlap statistics, we propose two collection selection methods that aim to maximize the number of unique relevant documents in the final results. We show experimentally that, although our estimates of overlap are not in exact, our suggested techniques can significantly improve the search effectiveness when collections overlap.
1277828	Evaluating sampling methods for uncooperative collections Many server selection methods suitable for distributed information retrieval applications rely, in the absence of cooperation, on the availability of unbiased samples of documents from the constituent collections. We describe a number of sampling methods which depend only on the normal query-response mechanism of the applicable search facilities. We evaluate these methods on a number of collections typical of a personal metasearch application. Results demonstrate that biases exist for all methods, particularly toward longer documents, and that in some cases these biases can be reduced but not eliminated by choice of parameters.We also introduce a new sampling technique, "multiple queries", which produces samples of similar quality to the best current techniques but with significantly reduced cost.
1277829	Updating collection representations for federated search To facilitate the search for relevant information across a setof online distributed collections, a federated information retrieval system typically represents each collection, centrally, by a set of vocabularies or sampled documents. Accurate retrieval is therefore related to how precise each representation reflects the underlying content stored in that collection. As collections evolve over time, collection representations should also be updated to reflect any change, however, a current solution has not yet been proposed. In this study we examine both the implications of out-of-date representation sets on retrieval accuracy, as well as proposing three different policies for managing necessary updates. Each policyis evaluated on a testbed of forty-four dynamic collections over an eight-week period. Our findings show that out-of-date representations significantly degrade performance overtime, however, adopting a suitable update policy can minimise this problem.
1277831	A time machine for text search Text search over temporally versioned document collections such as web archives has received little attention as a research problem. As a consequence, there is no scalable and principled solution to search such a collection as of a specified time. In this work, we address this shortcoming and propose an efficient solution for time-travel text search by extending the inverted file index to make it ready for temporal search. We introduce approximate temporal coalescing as a tunable method to reduce the index size without significantly affecting the quality of results. In order to further improve the performance of time-travel queries, we introduce two principled techniques to trade off index size for its performance. These techniques can be formulated as optimization problems that can be solved to near-optimality. Finally, our approach is evaluated in a comprehensive series of experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets. Results unequivocally show that our methods make it possible to build an efficient "time machine" scalable to large versioned text collections.
1277832	Principles of hash-based text retrieval Hash-based similarity search reduces a continuous similarity relation to the binary concept "similar or not similar": two feature vectors are considered as similar if they are mapped on the same hash key. From its runtime performance this principle is unequaled--while being unaffected by dimensionality concerns at the same time. Similarity hashing is applied with great success for near similarity search in large document collections, and it is considered as a key technology for near-duplicate detection and plagiarism analysis. This papers reveals the design principles behind hash-based search methods and presents them in a unified way. We introduce new stress statistics that are suited to analyze the performance of hash-based search methods, and we explain the rationale of their effectiveness. Based on these insights, we show how optimum hash functions for similarity search can be derived. We also present new results of a comparative study between different hash-based search methods.
1277833	Compressed permuterm index Recently [Manning et al., 2007] resorted the Permuterm indexof Garfield (1976) as a time-efficient and elegant solution to the string dictionary problem in which pattern queries may possibly include one wild-card symbol (called, Tolerant Retrieval problem). Unfortunately the Permuterm index is space inefficient because its quadruples the dictionary size. In this paper we propose the Compressed Permuterm Index which solves the Tolerant Retrieval problem in optimal query time, i.e. time proportional to the length of the searched pattern, and space close to the k-th order empirical entropy of the indexed dictionary. Our index can be used to solve also more sophisticated queries which involve several wild-card symbols, or require to prefix-match multiple fields in a database of records.The result is based on an elegant variant of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform defined on a dictionary of strings of variable length, which allows to easily adapt known compressed indexes [Makinen-Navarro, 2007] to solve the Tolerant Retrieval problem. Experiments show that our index supports fast queries within a space occupancy that is close to the one achievable by compressing the string dictionary via gzip, bzip or ppmdi. This improves known approaches based on front-coding by more than 50% in absolute space occupancy, still guaranteeing comparable query time.
1277835	Query performance prediction in web search environments Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist. In this paper, we present three techniques to address these challenges. We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding. Our evaluation is mainly performed on the GOV2 collection. In addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately, we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior information on query types. To assist prediction under the mixed-query situation, a novel query classifier is adopted. Results show that our prediction of web query performance is substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art prediction techniques. Consequently, our paper provides a practical approach to performance prediction in real-world web settings.
1277836	Broad expertise retrieval in sparse data environments Expertise retrieval has been largely unexplored on data other than the W3C collection. At the same time, many intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organisations offer examples of relatively small but clean multilingual expertise data, covering broad ranges of expertise areas. We first present two main expertise retrieval tasks, along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people. For our experimental evaluation, we introduce (and release) a new test set based on a crawl of a university site. Using this test set, we conduct two series of experiments. The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise retrieval methods applied to the new test set. The second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic features of the new test set, such as the organizational structure of the university, and the hierarchical structure of the topics in the test set. Expertise retrieval models are shown to be robust with respect to environments smaller than the W3C collection, and current techniques appear to be generalizable to other settings.
1277837	A semantic approach to contextual advertising Contextual advertising or Context Match (CM) refers to the placement of commercial textual advertisements within the content of a generic web page, while Sponsored Search (SS) advertising consists in placing ads on result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query. In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience. With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads. The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by "bid phrases" representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach. However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads. To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.
1277839	How well does result relevance predict session satisfaction? Per-query relevance measures provide standardized, repeatable measurements of search result quality, but they ignore much of what users actually experience in a full search session. This paper examines how well we can approximate a user's ultimate session-level satisfaction using a simple relevance metric. We find that thisrelationship is surprisingly strong. By incorporating additional properties of the query itself, we construct a model which predicts user satisfaction even more accurately than relevance alone.
1277840	A new approach for evaluating query expansion: query-document term mismatch The effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) systems is influenced by the degree of term overlap between user queries and relevant documents. Query-document term mismatch, whether partial or total, is a fact that must be dealt with by IR systems. Query Expansion (QE) is one method for dealing with term mismatch. IR systems implementing query expansion are typically evaluated by executing each query twice, with and without query expansion, and then comparing the two result sets. While this measures an overall change in performance, it does not directly measure the effectiveness of IR systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term mismatch between the query and relevant documents, nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query-document term mismatch. In this paper, we propose a new approach for evaluating query expansion techniques. The proposed approach is attractive because it provides an estimate of system performance under varying degrees of query-document term mismatch, it makes use of readily available test collections, and it does not require any additional relevance judgments or any form of manual processing.
1277841	Performance prediction using spatial autocorrelation Evaluation of information retrieval systems is one of the core tasks in information retrieval. Problems include the inability to exhaustively label all documents for a topic, generalizability from a small number of topics, and incorporating the variability of retrieval systems. Previous work addresses the evaluation of systems, the ranking of queries by difficulty, and the ranking of individual retrievals by performance. Approaches exist for the case of few and even no relevance judgments. Our focus is on zero-judgment performance prediction of individual retrievals. One common shortcoming of previous techniques is the assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments. If documents are embedded in a high-dimensional space (as they often are), we can apply techniques from spatial data analysis to detect correlations between document scores. We find that the low correlation between scores of topically close documents often implies a poor retrieval performance. When compared to a state of the art baseline, we demonstrate that the spatial analysis of retrieval scores provides significantly better prediction performance. These new predictors can also be incorporated with classic predictors to improve performance further. We also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance prediction for a massive number of retrieval systems over a variety collections in several languages.
1277843	An outranking approach for rank aggregation in information retrieval Research in Information Retrieval usually shows performanceimprovement when many sources of evidence are combined to produce a ranking of documents (e.g., texts, pictures, sounds, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the rank aggregation problem, also called data fusion problem, where rankings of documents, searched into the same collection and provided by multiple methods, are combined in order to produce a new ranking. In this context, we propose a rank aggregation method within a multiple criteria framework using aggregation mechanisms based on decision rules identifying positive and negative reasons for judging whether a document should get a better rank than another. We show that the proposed method deals well with the Information Retrieval distinctive features. Experimental results are reported showing that the suggested method performs better than the well-known CombSUM and CombMNZ operators.
1277844	Enhancing relevance scoring with chronological term rank We introduce a new relevance scoring technique that enhances existing relevance scoring schemes with term position information. This technique uses chronological term rank (CTR) which captures the positions of terms as they occur in the sequence of words in a document. CTR is both conceptually and computationally simple when compared to other approaches that use document structure information, such as term proximity, term order and document features. CTR works well when paired with Okapi BM25. We evaluate the performance of various combinations of CTR with Okapi BM25 in order to identify the most effective formula. We then compare the performance of the selected approach against the performance of existing methods such as Okapi BM25, pivoted length normalization and language models. Significant improvements are seen consistently across a variety of TREC data and topic sets, measured by the major retrieval performance metrics. This seems to be the first use of this statistic for relevance scoring. There is likely to be greater retrieval improvements possible using chronological term rank enhanced methods in future work.
1277845	ARSA: a sentiment-aware model for predicting sales performance using blogs Due to its high popularity, Weblogs (or blogs in short) present a wealth of information that can be very helpful in assessing the general public's sentiments and opinions. In this paper, we study the problem of mining sentiment information from blogs and investigate ways to use such information for predicting product sales performance. Based on an analysis of the complex nature of sentiments, we propose Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA), in which a blog entry is viewed as a document generated by a number of hidden sentiment factors. Training an S-PLSA model on the blog data enables us to obtain a succinct summary of the sentiment information embedded in the blogs. We then present ARSA, an autoregressive sentiment-aware model, to utilize the sentiment information captured by S-PLSA for predicting product sales performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on a movie data set. We compare ARSA with alternative models that do not take into account the sentiment information, as well as a model with a different feature selection method. Experiments confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.
1277847	Vocabulary independent spoken term detection We are interested in retrieving information from speech data like broadcast news, telephone conversations and roundtable meetings. Today, most systems use large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tools to produce word transcripts; the transcripts are indexed and query terms are retrieved from the index. However, query terms that are not part of the recognizer's vocabulary cannot be retrieved, and the recall of the search is affected. In addition to the output word transcript, advanced systems provide also phonetic transcripts, against which query terms can be matched phonetically. Such phonetic transcripts suffer from lower accuracy and cannot be an alternative to word transcripts.We present a vocabulary independent system that can handle arbitrary queries, exploiting the information provided by having both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts. A speech recognizer generates word confusion networks and phonetic lattices. The transcripts are indexed for query processing and ranking purpose.The value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high performance ofour system, which received the highest overall ranking for US English speech data in the recent NIST Spoken Term Detection evaluation.
1277848	Improving text classification for oral history archives with temporal domain knowledge This paper describes two new techniques for increasing the accuracy oftopic label assignment to conversational speech from oral history interviews using supervised machine learning in conjunction with automatic speech recognition. The first, time-shifted classification, leverages local sequence information from the order in which the story is told. The second, temporal label weighting, takes the complementary perspective by using the position within an interview to bias label assignment probabilities. These methods, when used in combination, yield between 6% and 15% relative improvements in classification accuracy using a clipped R-precision measure that models the utility of label sets as segment summaries in interactive speech retrieval applications.
1277849	Indexing confusion networks for morph-based spoken document retrieval In this paper, we investigate methods for improving the performance of morph-based spoken document retrieval in Finnish by extracting relevant index terms from confusion networks. Our approach uses morpheme-like subword units ("morphs") for recognition and indexing. This alleviates the problem of out-of-vocabulary words, especially with inflectional languages like Finnish. Confusion networks offer a convenient representation of alternative recognition candidates by aligning mutually exclusive terms and by giving the posterior probability of each term. The rank of the competing terms and their posterior probability is used to estimate term frequency for indexing. Comparing against 1-best recognizer transcripts, we show that retrieval effectiveness is significantly improved. Finally, the effect of pruning in recognition is analyzed, showing that when recognition speed is increased, the reduction in retrieval performance due to the increase in the 1-best error rate can be compensated by using confusion networks.
1277851	Context sensitive stemming for web search Traditionally, stemming has been applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing, and applying a similar transformation to query terms. Although it increases recall, this naive strategy does not work well for Web Search since it lowers precision and requires a significant amount of additional computation. In this paper, we propose a context sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues. Two unique properties make our approach feasible for Web Search. First, based on statistical language modeling, we perform context sensitive analysis on the query side. We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine. This dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions, which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and improves the precision at the same time. Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants. This conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming, and it turns out to be very important for improving precision. Using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29% of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG5) by 6.1% on these queriesand 1.8% over all query traffic.
1277852	Detecting, categorizing and clustering entity mentions in Chinese text The work presented in this paper is motivated by the practical need for content extraction, and the available data source and evaluation benchmark from the ACE program. The Chinese Entity Detection and Recognition (EDR) task is of particular interest to us. This task presents us several language-independent and language-dependent challenges, e.g. rising from the complication of extraction targets and the problem of word segmentation, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to alleviate the problems special in the task. Mention detection takes advantages of machine learning approaches and character-based models. It manipulates different types of entities being mentioned and different constitution units (i.e. extents and heads) separately. Mentions referring to the same entity are linked together by integrating most-specific-first and closest-first rule based pairwise clustering algorithms. Types of mentions and entities are determined by head-driven classification approaches. The implemented system achieves ACE value of 66.1 when evaluated on the EDR 2005 Chinese corpus, which has been one of the top-tier results. Alternative approaches to mention detection and clustering are also discussed and analyzed.
1277853	Knowledge-intensive conceptual retrieval and passage extraction of biomedical literature This paper presents a study of incorporating domain-specific knowledge (i.e., information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain) in an information retrieval (IR) system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical literature. The effects of different types of domain-specific knowledge in performance contribution are examined. Based on the TREC platform, we show that appropriate use of domain-specific knowledge in a proposed conceptual retrieval model yields about 23% improvement over the best reported result in passage retrieval in the Genomics Track of TREC 2006.
1277855	Heavy-tailed distributions and multi-keyword queries Intersecting inverted indexes is a fundamental operation for many applications in information retrieval and databases. Efficient indexing for this operation is known to be a hard problem for arbitrary data distributions. However, text corpora used in Information Retrieval applications often have convenient power-law constraints (also known as Zipf's Law and long tails) that allow us to materialize carefully chosen combinations of multi-keyword indexes, which significantly improve worst-case performance without requiring excessive storage. These multi-keyword indexes limit the number of postings accessed when computing arbitrary index intersections. Our evaluation on an e-commerce collection of 20 million products shows that the indexes of up to four arbitrary keywords can be intersected while accessing less than 20% of the postings in the largest single-keyword index.
1277856	ESTER: efficient search on text, entities, and relations We present ESTER, a modular and highly efficient system for combined full-text and ontology search. ESTER builds on a query engine that supports two basic operations: prefix search and join. Both of these can be implemented very efficiently with a compact index, yet in combination provide powerful querying capabilities. We show how ESTER can answer basic SPARQL graph-pattern queries on the ontology by reducing them to a small number of these two basic operations. ESTER further supports a natural blend of such semantic queries with ordinary full-text queries. Moreover, the prefix search operation allows for a fully interactive and proactive user interface, which after every keystroke suggests to the user possible semantic interpretations of his or her query, and speculatively executes the most likely of these interpretations. As a proof of concept, we applied ESTER to the English Wikipedia, which contains about 3 million documents, combined with the recent YAGO ontology, which contains about 2.5 million facts. For a variety of complex queries, ESTER achieves worst-case query processing times of a fraction of a second, on a single machine, with an index size of about 4 GB.
1277857	Web text retrieval with a P2P query-driven index In this paper, we present a query-driven indexing/retrieval strategy for efficient full text retrieval from large document collections distributed within a structured P2P network. Our indexing strategy is based on two important properties: (1) the generated distributed index stores posting lists for carefully chosen indexing term combinations, and (2) the posting lists containing too many document references are truncated to a bounded number of their top-ranked elements. These two properties guarantee acceptable storage and bandwidth requirements, essentially because the number of indexing term combinations remains scalable and the transmitted posting lists never exceed a constant size. However, as the number of generated term combinations can still become quite large, we also use term statistics extracted from available query logs to index only such combinations that are frequently present in user queries. Thus, by avoiding the generation of superfluous indexing term combinations, we achieve an additional substantial reduction in bandwidth and storage consumption. As a result, the generated distributed index corresponds to a constantly evolving query-driven indexing structure that efficiently follows current information needs of the users. More precisely, our theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that, at the price of a marginal loss in retrieval quality for rare queries, the generated index size and network traffic remain manageable even for web-size document collections. Furthermore, our experiments show that at the same time the achieved retrieval quality is fully comparable to the one obtained with a state-of-the-art centralized query engine.
1277859	Using gradient descent to optimize language modeling smoothing parameters An abstract is not available.
1277860	Locality discriminating indexing for document classification This paper introduces a locality discriminating indexing (LDI) algorithm for document classification. Based on the hypothesis that samples from different classes reside in class-specific manifold structures, LDI seeks for a projection which best preserves the within-class local structures while suppresses the between-class overlap. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method isable to derives compact discriminating document representations for classification.
1277861	Management of keyword variation with frequency based generation of word forms in IR This paper presents a new management method for morphological variation of keywords. The method is called FCG, Frequent Case Generation. It is based on the skewed distributions of word forms in natural languages and is suitable for languages that have either fair amount of morphological variation or are morphologically very rich. The proposed method has been evaluated so far with four languages, Finnish, Swedish, German and Russian, which show varying degrees of morphological complexity.
1277862	OMES: a new evaluation strategy using optimal matching for document clustering Existing measures for evaluating clustering results (e.g. F-measure) have the limitation of overestimating cluster quality because they usually adopt the greedy matching between classes (reference clusters) and clusters (system clusters) to allow multiple classes to correspond to one same cluster, which is in fact a locally optimal solution. This paper proposes a new evaluation strategy to overcome the limitation of existing evaluation measures by using optimal matching in graph theory. A weighted bipartite graph is built with classes and clusters as two disjoint sets of vertices and the edge weight between any class and any cluster is computed using a basic metric. Then the total weight of the optimal matching in the graph is acquired and we use it to evaluate the quality of the clusters. The optimal matching allows only one-to-one matching between classes and clusters and a globally optimal solution can be achieved. A preliminary study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation strategy.
1277863	Revisiting the dependence language model for information retrieval In this paper, we revisit the dependence language modelfor information retrieval proposed in [1], and show that thismodel is deficient from a theoretical point of view. We thenpropose a new model, well founded theoretically, for integratingdependencies between terms in the language model.This new model is simpler, yet more general, than the oneproposed in [1], and yields similar results in our experiments,on both syntactic and semantic dependencies.
1277864	Quantify query ambiguity using ODP metadata Query ambiguity prevents existing retrieval systems from returning reasonable results for every query. As there is already lots of work done on resolving ambiguity, vague queries could be handled using corresponding approaches separately if they can be identified in advance. Quantification of the degree of (lack of) ambiguity laysthe groundwork for the identification. In this poster, we propose such a measure using query topics based on the topic structure selected from the Open Directory Project (ODP) taxonomy. We introduce clarity score to quantify the lack of ambiguity with respect to data sets constructed from the TREC collections and the rank correlation test results demonstrate a strong positive association between the clarity scores and retrieval precisions for queries.
1277865	Combining error-correcting output codes and model-refinement for text categorization In this work, we explore the use of error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to enhance the performance of centroid text classifier. The framework is to decompose one multi-class problem into multiple binary problems and then learn the individual binary classification problems by centroid classifier. However, this kind of decomposition incurs considerable bias for centroid classifier, which results in noticeable degradation of performance. To address this issue, we use Model-Refinement to adjust this so-called bias.
1277866	User-oriented text segmentation evaluation measure The paper describes a user oriented performance evaluation measure for text segmentation. Experiments show that the proposed measure differentiates well between error distributions with varying user impact.
1277867	Story segmentation of broadcast news in Arabic, Chinese and English using multi-window features The paper describes a maximum entropy based story segmentation system for Arabic, Chinese and English. In experiments with broadcast news data from TDT-3, TDT-4, and corpora collected in the DARPA GALE project we obtain a substantial performance gain using multiple overlapping windows for text-based features.
1277868	Recommending citations for academic papers We approach the problem of academic literature search by considering an unpublished manuscript as a query to a search system. We use the text of previous literature as well as the citation graph that connects it to find relevant related material. We evaluate our technique with manual and automatic evaluation methods, and find an order of magnitude improvement in mean average precision as compared to a text similarity baseline.
1277869	Exploration of the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency for results merging in federated search Federated search is the task of retrieving relevant documents from different information resources. One of the main research problems in federated search is to combine the results from different sources into a single ranked list. Recent work proposed a regression based method to download some documents from each ranked list of the different sources, calculated comparable scores for the documents and estimated mapping functions that transform source-specific scores into comparable scores. Experiments have shown that downloading more documents improves the accuracy of results merging. However downloading more documents increases the computation and communication costs. This paper proposes a utility based optimization method that enables the system to automatically decide on the desired number of training documents to download according to the user's need for effectiveness and efficiency.
1277870	Understanding the relationship of information need specificity to search query length When searching, people's information needs flowthrough to expressing an information retrieval request posed to asearch engine. We hypothesise that the degree of specificity of anIR request might correspond to the length of a search query. Ourresults show a strong correlation between decreasing query lengthand increasing broadness or generality of the IR request. We foundan average cross-over point of specificity from broad to narrow of 3words in the query. These results have implications for searchengines in responding to queries of differing lengths.
1277871	An effective snippet generation method using the pseudo relevance feedback technique A (page or web) snippet is document excerpts allowing a user to understand if a document is indeed relevant without accessing it. This paper proposes an effective snippet generation method. The pseudo relevance feedback technique and text summarization techniques are applied to salient sentences extraction for generating good quality snippets. In the experimental results, the proposed method showed much better performance than other methods including Google and Naver.
1277872	Probability ranking principle via optimal expected rank This paper presents a new perspective of the probability ranking principle (PRP) by defining retrieval effectiveness in terms of our novel expected rank measure of a set of documents for a particular query. This perspective is based on preserving decision preferences, and it imposes weaker conditions on PRP than the utility-theoretic perspective of PRP.
1277873	Combining term-based and event-based matching for question answering In question answering, two main kinds of matching methods for finding answer sentences for a question are term-based approaches -- which are simple, efficient, effective, and yield high recall -- and event-based approaches that take syntactic and semantic information into account. The latter often sacrifice recall for increased precision, but actually capture the meaning of the events denoted by the textual units of a passage or sentence. We propose a robust, data-driven method that learns the mapping between questions and answers using logistic regression and show that combining term-based and event-based approaches significantly outperforms the individual methods.
1277874	Confluence : enhancing contextual desktop search We present Confluence , an enhancement to a desktop file search tool called Confluence which extracts conceptual relationships between files by their temporal access patterns in the file system. A limitation of a purely file-based approach is that as file operations are increasingly abstracted by applications, their correlation to a user's activity weakens and thereby reduces the applicability of their temporal patterns. To deal with this problem, we augment the file event stream with a stream of window focus events from the UI layer. We present 3 algorithms that analyze this new stream, extracting the user's task information which informs the existing Confluence algorithms. We present results and conclusions from a preliminary user study on Confluence.
1277875	Estimating the value of automatic disambiguation A common motivation for personalised search systems is the ability to disambiguate queries based on some knowledge of a user's interests. An analysis of log files from three search providers, covering a range of scenarios, suggests that this sort of disambiguation would be of marginal use for more specialised providers but may be of use for whole-of-Web search.
1277876	A generic framework for machine transliteration An abstract is not available.
1277877	Where to start reading a textual XML document? In structured information retrieval, the aim is to exploit document structure to retrieve relevant components, allowing the user to go straight to the relevant material. This paper looks at the so-called best entry points (BEPs), which are intended to give the user the best starting point to access the relevant information in the document. We examine the relationship between BEPs and relevant components in the INEX 2006 ad hoc assessments. Our main findings are the following: First, although documents are short, assessors often choose the best entry point some distance from the start of the document. Second, many of the best entry points coincide with the first relevant character in relevant documents, showing a strong relation between the BEP and relevant text. Third, we find browsing BEPs in articles with a single relevant passages, and container BEPs or context BEPs in articles with more relevant passages.
1277878	Novelty detection using local context analysis An abstract is not available.
1277879	Intra-assessor consistency in question answering In this paper we investigate the consistency of answer assessment in a complex question answering task examining features of assessor consistency, types of answers and question type.
1277880	Towards robust query expansion: model selection in the language modeling framework We propose a language-model-based approach for addressing the performance robustness problem -- with respect to free-parameters' values -- of pseudo-feedback-based query-expansion methods. Given a query, we create a set of language models representing different forms of its expansion by varying the parameters' values of some expansion method; then, we select a single model using criteria originally proposed for evaluating the performance of using the original query, or for deciding whether to employ expansion at all. Experimental results show that these criteria are highly effective in selecting relevance language models that are not only significantly more effective than poor performing ones, but that also yield performance that is almost indistinguishable from that of manually optimized relevance models.
1277881	Automatic classification of web pages into bookmark categories We describe a technique to automatically classify a web page into an existing bookmark category to help a user to bookmark a page. HyperBK compares a bag-of-words representation of the page to descriptions of categories in the user's bookmark file. Unlike default web browser dialog boxes in which the user may be presented with the category into which he or she saved the last bookmarked file, HyperBK also offers the category most similar to the page being bookmarked. The user can also opt to create a new category; or save the page elsewhere. In an evaluation, the user's preferred category was offered on average 61% of the time.
1277882	What emotions do news articles trigger in their readers? We study the classification of news articles into emotions they invoke in their readers. Our work differs from previous studies, which focused on the classification of documents into their authors' emotions instead of the readers'. We use various combinations of feature sets to find the best combination for identifying the emotional influences of news articles on readers.
1277883	Evaluating discourse-based answer extraction for why -question answering An abstract is not available.
1277884	Topic segmentation using weighted lexical links (WLL) This paper presents two new approaches of lexical chains for topic segmentation using weighted lexical chains (WLC) or weighted lexical links (WLL) between repeated occurrences of lemmas along the text. The main advantage of using these new approaches is the suppression of the empirical parameter called hiatus in lexical chain processing. An evaluation according to the WindowDiff measure on a large automatically built corpus shows slight improvements in WLL compared to state-of-the-art methods based on lexical chains.
1277885	Lexical analysis for modeling web query reformulation Modeling Web query reformulation processes is still an unsolved problem. In this paper we argue that lexical analysis is highly beneficial for this purpose. We propose to use the variation in Query Clarity, as well as the Part-Of-Speech pattern transitions as indicators of user's search actions. Experiments with a log of 2.4 million queries showed our techniques to be more flexible than the current approaches, while also providing us with interesting insights into user's Web behavioral patterns.
1277886	Bridging the digital divide: understanding information access practices in an indian village community For digital library and information retrieval technologies to provide solutions for bridging the digital divide in developing countries, we need to understand the information access practices of remote and often poor communities in these countries. We must understand the information needs of these communities, and the best means to provide them access to relevant information. To this end, we investigated the current information access practices in an Indian village.
1277887	BordaConsensus: a new consensus function for soft cluster ensembles Consensus clustering is the task of deriving a single labeling by applying a consensus function on a cluster ensemble. This work introduces BordaConsensus, a new consensus function for soft cluster ensembles based on the Borda voting scheme. In contrast to classic, hard consensus functions that operate on labelings, our proposal considers cluster membership information, thus being able to tackle multiclass clustering problems. Initial small scale experiments reveal that, compared to state-of-the-art consensus functions, BordaConsensus constitutes a good performance vs. complexity trade-off.
1277888	A flexible retrieval system of shapes in binary images This poster overviews the main characteristics of a flexible retrieval systems of shapes present in binary images and discusses some evaluation results. The system applies multiple indexing criteria of the shapes synthesizing distinct characteristics such as global features of the objects contour (Fourier Coefficients), boundary irregularities (Multifractal Spectrum), presence of concavities and convexities on the boundary (Contour Scale Space distribution). The system is flexible since it allows customizing the retrieval function to fit an application need. The query is a binary image containing the desired shape and a set of parameters specifying the distinct importance of the shape characteristics that must be taken into account to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved shapes. The retrieval function is then defined as a Flexible Multicriteria fusion Function producing ranked results. The evaluation experiments showed that this system can be suited to different retrieval purposes, and that generally the combination of the distinct shape indexing criteria increases both Recall and Precision with respect to the application of any single indexing criterion alone.
1277889	Semantic text classification of disease reporting Traditional text classification studied in the IR literature is mainly based on topics. That is, each class or category represents a particular topic, e.g., sports, politics or sciences. However, many real-world text classification problems require more refined classification based on some semantic aspects. For example, in a set of documents about a particular disease, some documents may report the outbreak of the disease, some may describe how to cure the disease, some may discuss how to prevent the disease, and yet some others may include all the above information. To classify text at this semantic level, the traditional "bag of words" model is no longer sufficient. In this paper, we report a text classification study at the semantic level and show that sentence semantic and structure features are very useful for such kind of classification. Our experimental results based on a disease outbreak dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1277890	Evaluating relevant in context: document retrieval with a twist The Relevant in Context retrieval task is document or article retrieval with a twist, where not only the relevant articles should be retrieved but also the relevant information within each article (captured by a set of XML elements) should be correctly identified. Our main research question is: how to evaluate the Relevant in Context task? We propose a generalized average precision measure that meets two main requirements: i) the score reflects the ranked list of articles inherent in the result list, and at the same time ii) the score also reflects how well the retrieved information per article (i.e., the set of elements) corresponds to the relevant information. The resulting measure was used at INEX 2006.
1277891	IDF revisited: a simple new derivation within the Robertson-Spärck Jones probabilistic model There have been a number of prior attempts to theoretically justify the effectiveness of the inverse document frequency (IDF). Those that take as their starting point Robertson and Sparck Jones's probabilistic model are based on strong or complex assumptions. We show that a more intuitively plausible assumption suffices. Moreover, the new assumption, while conceptually very simple, provides a solution to an estimation problem that had been deemed intractable by Robertson and Walker (1997).
1277892	Validity and power of t-test for comparing MAP and GMAP We examine the validity and power of the t-test, Wilcoxon test, and sign test in determining whether or not the difference in performance between two IR systems is significant. Empirical tests conducted on subsets of the TREC2004 Robust Retrieval collection indicate that the p-values computed by these tests for the difference in mean average precision (MAP) between two systems are very accurate fora wide range of sample sizes and significance estimates. Similarly, these tests have good power, with the t-test proving superior overall. The t-test is also valid for comparing geometric mean average precision (GMAP), exhibiting slightly superior accuracy and slightly inferior power than for MAPcomparison.
1277893	Model-averaged latent semantic indexing This poster introduces a novel approach to information retrieval that uses statistical model averaging to improve latent semantic indexing (LSI). Instead of choosing a single dimensionality $k$ for LSI , we propose using several models of differing dimensionality to inform retrieval. To manage this ensemble we weight each model's contribution to an extent inversely proportional to its AIC (Akaike information criterion). Thus each model contributes proportionally to its expected Kullback-Leibler divergence from the distribution that generated the data. We present results on three standard IR test collections, demonstrating significant improvement over both the traditional vector space model and single-model LSI.
1277894	Characterizing the value of personalizing search We investigate the diverse goals that people have when they issue the same query to a search engine, and the ability of current search engines to address such diversity. We quantify the potential value of personalizing search results based on this analysis. Great variance was found in the results that different individuals rated as relevant for the same query -- even when the same information goal was expressed. Our analysis suggests that while search engines do a good job of ranking results to maximize global happiness, they do not do a very good job for specific individuals.
1277895	Improving retrieval accuracy by weighting document types with clickthrough data For enterprise search, there exists a relationship between work task and document type that can be used to refine search results. In this poster, we adapt the popular Okapi BM25 scoring function to weight term frequency based on the relevance of a document type to a work task. Also, we use click frequency for each task-type pair to estimate a realistic weight. Using the W3C collection from the TREC Enterprise track for evaluations, our approach leads to significant improvements on search precision.
1277896	Protecting source privacy in federated search Many information sources contain information that can only be accessed through search-specific search engines. Federated search provides search solutions of this type of hidden information that cannot be searched by conventional search engines. In many scenarios of federated search, such as the search among health care providers or among intelligence agencies, an individual information source does not want to disclose the source of the search results to users or other sources. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step federated search protocol that protects the privacy of information sources. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to address the research problem of protecting source privacy in federated text search.
1277897	Applying ranking SVM in query relaxation We propose an approach QRRS (Query Relaxative Ranking SVM) that divides a ranking function into different relaxation steps, so that only cheap features are used in Ranking SVM of early steps for query efficiency. We show search quality in the approach is improved compared to conventional Ranking SVM.
1277898	Learning to rank collections Collection selection, ranking collections according to user query is crucial in distributed search. However, few features are used to rank collections in the current collection selection methods, while hundreds of features are exploited to rank web pages in web search. The lack of features affects the efficiency of collection selection in distributed search. In this paper, we exploit some new features and learn to rank collections with them through SVM and RankingSVM respectively. Experimental results show that our features are beneficial to collection selection, and the learned ranking functions outperform the classical CORI algorithm.
1277899	VideoReach: an online video recommendation system This paper presents a novel online video recommendation system called VideoReach , which alleviates users' efforts on finding the most relevant videos according to current viewings without a sufficient collection of user profiles as required in traditional recommenders. In this system, video recommendation is formulated as finding a list of relevant videos in terms of multimodal relevance (i.e. textual, visual, and aural relevance) and user click-through. Since different videos have different intra-weights of relevance within an individual modality and inter-weights among different modalities, we adopt relevance feedback to automatically find optimal weights by user click-though, as well as an attention fusion function to fuse multimodal relevance. We use 20 clips as the representative test videos, which are searched by top 10 queries from more than 13 k online videos, and report superior performance compared with an existing video site.
1277900	Modelling epistemic uncertainty in ir evaluation Modern information retrieval (IR) test collections violate the completeness assumption of the Cranfield paradigm. In order to maximise the available resources, only a sample of documents (i.e. the pool) are judged for relevance by a human assessor(s). The subsequent evaluation protocol does not make any distinctions between assessed or unassesseddocuments, as documents that are not in the pool are assumedto be not relevant for the topic. This is beneficial from a practical point of view, as the relative performance can be compared with confidence if the experimental conditions are fair for all systems. However, given the incompleteness of relevance assessments, two forms of uncertainty emerge during evaluation. The first is Aleatory uncertainty, which refers to variation in system performance across the topic set, which is often addressed through the use of statistical significance tests. The second form of uncertainty is Epistemic, which refers to the amount of knowledge (or ignorance) we have about the estimate of a system's performance. Epistemic uncertainty is a consequence of incompleteness and is not addressed by the current evaluation protocol. In this study, we present a first attempt at modelling both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty associatedwith IR evaluation. We aim to account for both the variability associated with system performance and the amount of knowledge known about the performance estimate.
1277901	On the importance of preserving the part-order in shape retrieval This paper discusses the importance of part-order-preservation in shape matching. A part descriptor is introduced that supports both preserving and abandoning the order of parts. The evaluation shows that retrieval results are improved by almost 38% if the original ordering is preserved.
1277902	The relationship between IR effectiveness measures and user satisfaction This paper presents an experimental study of users assessing the quality of Google web search results. In particular we look at how users' satisfaction correlates with the effectiveness of Google as quantified by IR measures such as precision and the suite of Cumulative Gain measures (CG, DCG, NDCG). Results indicate strong correlation between users' satisfaction, CG and precision, moderate correlation with DCG, with perhaps surprisingly negligible correlation with NDCG. The reasons for the low correlation with NDCG are examined.
1277903	A multi-criteria content-based filtering system In this paper we present a novel filtering system, based on a new model which reshapes the aims of content-based filtering. The filtering system has been developed within the EC project PENG, aimed at providing news professionals, such as journalists, with a system supporting both filtering and retrieval capabilities. In particular, we suggest that in tackling the problem of information overload, it is necessary for filtering systems to take into account multiple aspects of incoming documents in order to estimate their relevance to a user's profile, and in order to help users better understand documents, as distinct from solely attempting to either select relevant material from a stream, or block inappropriate material. Aiming to so this, a filtering model based on multiple criteria has been defined, based on the ideas gleamed in the project requirements stage. The filtering model is briefly described in this paper.
1277904	Boosting static pruning of inverted files This paper revisits the static term-based pruning technique presented in Carmel et al., SIGIR 2001 for ad-hoc retrieval, addressing different issues concerning its algorithmic design not yet taken into account. Although the original technique is able to retain precision when a considerable part of the inverted file is removed, we show that it is possible to improve precision in some scenarios if some key design features are properly selected.
1277905	Resource monitoring in information extraction It is often argued that in information extraction (IE), certain machine learning (ML) approaches save development time over others, or that certain ML methods (e.g. Active Learning) require less training data than others, thus saving development cost. However, such development cost claims are not normally backed up by controlled studies which show that such development cost savings actually occur. This situation in Language Engineering is contrasted with Software Engineering in general, where a lot of studies investigating system development cost have been carried out. We argue for the need of controlled studies that measure actual system development time in language engineering. To this end, we carry out an experiment in resource monitoring for an IE task: three named entity taggers for the same "surprise" domain are developed in parallel, using competing methods. Their human development time is accounted forusing a logging facility.We report development cost results for parallel implementations of a named entity tagger and present a breakdown of the development time for the three alternative methods. We are not aware of detailed previous parallel studies that detail how system development time is spent when creating a named entity tagger.
1277906	The DILIGENT framework for distributed information retrieval An abstract is not available.
1277907	Varying approaches to topical web query classification Topical classification of web queries has drawn recent interest because of the promise it offers in improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. However, much of this promise depends on whether classification is performed before or after the query is used to retrieve documents. We examine two previously unaddressed issues in query classification: pre versus post-retrieval classification effectiveness and the effect of training explicitly from classified queries versus bridging a classifier trained using a document taxonomy. Bridging classifiers map the categories of a document taxonomy onto those of a query classification problem to provide sufficient training data. We find that training classifiers explicitly from manually classified queries outperforms the bridged classifier by 48% in F1 score. Also, a pre-retrieval classifier using only the query terms performs merely 11% worse than the bridged classifier which requires snippets from retrieved documents.
1277908	A comparison of pooled and sampled relevance judgments Test collections are most useful when they are reusable, that is, when they can be reliably used to rank systems that did not contribute to the pools. Pooled relevance judgments for very large collections may not be reusable for two easons: they will be very sparse and not sufficiently complete, and they may be biased in the sense that theywill unfairly rank some class of systems. The TREC 2006 terabyte track judged both a pool and a deep random sample in order to measure the effects of sparseness and bias.
1277909	Clustering short texts using wikipedia Subscribers to the popular news or blog feeds (RSS/Atom) often face the problem of information overload as these feed sources usually deliver large number of items periodically. One solution to this problem could be clustering similar items in the feed reader to make the information more manageable for a user. Clustering items at the feed reader end is a challenging task as usually only a small part of the actual article is received through the feed. In this paper, we propose a method of improving the accuracy of clustering short texts by enriching their representation with additional features from Wikipedia. Empirical results indicate that this enriched representation of text items can substantially improve the clustering accuracy when compared to the conventional bag of words representation.
1277910	Estimating collection size with logistic regression Collection size is an important feature to represent the content summaries of a collection, and plays a vital role in collection selection for distributed search. In uncooperative environments, collection size estimation algorithms are adopted to estimate the sizes of collections with their search interfaces. This paper proposes heterogeneous capture (HC) algorithm, in which the capture probabilities of documents are modeled with logistic regression. With heterogeneous capture probabilities, HC algorithm estimates collection size through conditional maximum likelihood. Experimental results on real web data show that our HC algorithm outperforms both multiple capture-recapture and capture history algorithms.
1277911	Selection and ranking of text from highly imperfect transcripts for retrieval of video content In the domain of video content retrieval, we present an approach for selecting words and phrases from highly imperfect automatically generated transcripts. Extracted terms are ranked according to their descriptiveness and presented to the user in a multimedia browser interface. We use sense querying from the WordNet lexical database for our method of text selection and ranking. Evaluation of 679 video summarization tasks from 442 users shows that the method of ranking and emphasizing terms according to descriptiveness results in higher accuracy responses in less time compared to the baseline of no ranking.
1277912	Enhancing patent retrieval by citation analysis This paper proposes a method to combine text-based and citation-based retrieval methods in the invalidity patent search. Using the NTCIR-6 test collection including eight years of USPTO patents, we show the effectiveness of our method experimentally.
1277913	MRF based approach for sentence retrieval This poster focuses on the study of term context dependence in the application of sentence retrieval. Based on Markov Random Field (MRF), three forms of dependence among query terms are considered. Under different assumptions of term dependence relationship, three feature functions are defined, with the purpose to utilize association features between query terms in sentence to evaluate the relevance of sentence. Experimental results have proven the efficiency of the proposed retrieval models in improving the performance of sentence retrieval.
1277914	Improving weak ad-hoc queries using wikipedia asexternal corpus In an ad-hoc retrieval task, the query is usually short and the user expects to find the relevant documents in the first several result pages. We explored the possibilities of using Wikipedia's articles as an external corpus to expand ad-hoc queries. Results show promising improvements over measures that emphasize on weak queries.

1277917	The influence of basic tokenization on biomedical document retrieval Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Information Retrieval systems in which text is turned into index terms. This paper quantifies and compares the influence of various simple tokenization techniques on document retrieval effectiveness in two domains: biomedicine and news. As expected, biomedical retrieval is more sensitive to small changes in the tokenization method. The tokenization strategy can make the difference between a mediocre and well performing IR system, especially in the biomedical domain.
1277918	Using clustering to enhance text classification This paper addresses the problem of learning to classify textsby exploiting information derived from clustering both training and testing sets. The incorporation of knowledge resulting from clustering into the feature space representation of the texts is expected to boost the performance of a classifier. Experiments conducted on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm especially for small training sets.
1277919	A fact/opinion classifier for news articles Many online news/blog aggregators like Google, Yahoo and MSN allow users to browse/search many hundreds of news sources. This results in dozens, often hundreds, of stories about the same event. While the news aggregators cluster these stories, allowing the user to efficiently scan the major news items at any given time, they do not currently allow alternative browsing mechanisms within the clusters. Furthermore, their intra-cluster ranking mechanisms are often based on a notion of authority/popularity of the source. In many cases, this leads to the classic power law phenomenon -- the popular stories/sources are the ones that are already popular/authoritative, thus reinforcing one dominant viewpoint. Ideally, these aggregators would exploit the availability of the tremendous number of sources to identify the various dominant threads or viewpoints about a story and highlight these threads for the users. This paper presents an initial limited approach to such an interface: it classifies articles into two categories: fact and opinion. We show that the combination of (i) a classifier trained on a small (140K) training set of editorials/reports and (ii) an interactive user interface that ameliorates classification errors by re-ordering the presentation can be effective in highlighting different underlying viewpoints in a story-cluster. We briefly discuss the classifier used here, the training set and the UI and report on some initial anecdotal user feedback and evaluation.
1277920	Matching resumes and jobs based on relevance models We investigate the difficult problem of matching semi-structured resumes and jobs in a large scale real-world collection. We compare standard approaches to Structured Relevance Models (SRM), an extensionof relevance-based language model for modeling and retrieving semi-structured documents. Preliminary experiments show that the SRM approach achieved promising performance and performed better than typical unstructured relevance models.
1277921	The utility of linguistic rules in opinion mining Online product reviews are one of the important opinion sources on the Web. This paper studies the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive or negative) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. Most existing approaches use a set of opinion words for the purpose. However, the semantic orientations of many words are context dependent. In this paper, we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function. Extensive experiments show that these rules and the function are highly effective. A system, called Opinion Observer, has also been built.
1277922	A comparison of sentence retrieval techniques Identifying redundant information in sentences is useful for several applications such as summarization, document provenance, detecting text reuse and novelty detection. The task of identifying redundant information in sentences is defined as follows: Given a query sentence the task is to retrieve sentences from a given collection that express all or some subset of the information present in the query sentence. Sentence retrieval techniques rank sentences based on some measure of their similarity to a query. The effectiveness of such techniques depends on the similarity measure used to rank sentences. An effective retrieval model should be able to handle low word overlap between query and candidate sentences and go beyond just word overlap. Simple language modeling techniques like query likelihood retrieval have outperformed TF-IDF and word overlap based methods for ranking sentences. In this paper, we compare the performance of sentence retrieval using different language modeling techniques for the problem of identifying redundant information.
1277923	High-dimensional visual vocabularies for image retrieval In this paper we formulate image retrieval by text query as a vector space classification problem. This is achieved by creating a high-dimensional visual vocabulary that represents the image documents in great detail. We show how the representation of these image documents enables the application of well known text retrieval techniques such as Rocchio tf-idf and naíve Bayes to the semantic image retrieval problem. We tested these methods on a Corel images subset and achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance using the proposed methods.
1277924	A web page topic segmentation algorithm based on visual criteria and content layout This paper presents experiments using an algorithm of web page topic segmentation that show significant precision improvement in the retrieval of documents issued from the Web track corpus of TREC 2001. Instead of processing the whole document, a web page is segmented into different semantic blocks according to visual criteria (such as horizontal lines, colors) and structural tags (such as headings <H1>~<H6>, paragraph <P>). We conclude that combining visual and content layout criteria gives the best results for increasing the precision: the ranking of the page is calculated for relevant segments of pages resulting from the segmentation algorithm.
1277925	Document clustering: an optimization problem Clustering algorithms have been widely used in information retrieval applications. However, it is difficult to define an objective "best" result. This article analyzes some document clustering algorithms and illustrates that they are equivalent to the optimization problem of some global functions. Experiments show their good performance, but there are still counter-examples where they fail to return the optimal solution. We argue that Monte-Carlo algorithms in the global optimization framework have the potential to find better solutions than traditional clustering, and they are able to handle more complex structures.
1277926	Finding similar experts The task of finding people who are experts on a topic has recently received increased attention. We introduce a different expert finding task for which a small number of example experts is given (instead of a natural language query), and the system's task is to return similar experts . We define, compare, and evaluate a number of ways of representing experts, and investigate how the size of theinitial example set affects performance. We show that morefine-grained representations of candidates result in higher performance, and larger sample sets as input lead to improved precision.
1277927	Active learning for class imbalance problem The class imbalance problem has been known to hinder the learning performance of classification algorithms. Various real-world classification tasks such as text categorization suffer from this phenomenon. We demonstrate that active learning is capable of solving the problem.
1277928	Strategies for retrieving plagiarized documents For the identification of plagiarized passages in large document collections we present retrieval strategies which rely on stochastic sampling and chunk indexes. Using the entire Wikipedia corpus we compile n-gram indexes and compare them to a new kind of fingerprint index in a plagiarism analysis use case. Our index provides an analysis speed-up by factor 1.5 and is an order of magnitude smaller, while being equivalent in terms of precision and recall.
1277929	Generative modeling of persons and documents for expert search In this paper we address the task of automatically finding an expert within the organization, known as the expert search problem. We present the theoretically-based probabilistic algorithm which models retrieved documents as mixtures of expert candidate language models. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing theoretically sound solutions.
1277930	Random walk term weighting for information retrieval We present a way of estimating term weights for Information Retrieval (IR), using term co-occurrence as a measure of dependency between terms.We use the random walk graph-based ranking algorithm on a graph that encodes terms and co-occurrence dependencies in text, from which we derive term weights that represent a quantification of how a term contributes to its context. Evaluation on two TREC collections and 350 topics shows that the random walk-based term weights perform at least comparably to the traditional tf-idf term weighting, while they outperform it when the distance between co-occurring terms is between 6 and 30 terms.
1277931	Comparing query logs and pseudo-relevance feedbackfor web-search query refinement Query logs and pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) offer ways in which terms to refine Web searchers' queries can be selected, offered to searchers, and used to improve search effectiveness. In this poster we present a study of these techniques that aims to characterize the degree of similarity between them across a set of test queries, and the same set broken out by query type. The results suggest that: (i) similarity increases with the amount of evidence provided to the PRF algorithm, (ii) similarity is higherwhen titles/snippets are used for PRF than full-text, and (iii) similarity is higher for navigational than informational queries. The findings have implications for the combined usage of query logs and PRF in generating query refinement alternatives.

1277934	Power and bias of subset pooling strategies We define a method to estimate the random and systematic errors resulting from incomplete relevance assessments.Mean Average Precision (MAP) computed over a large number of topics with a shallow assessment pool substantially outperforms -- for the same adjudication effort MAP computed over fewer topics with deeper pools, and P@k computed with pools of the same depth. Move-to-front pooling,previously reported to yield substantially better rank correlation, yields similar power, and lower bias, compared tofixed-depth pooling.
1277935	Problems with Kendall's tau This poster describes a potential problem with a relatively well used measure in Information Retrieval research: Kendall's Tau rank correlation coefficient. The coefficient is best known for its use in determining the similarity of test collections when ranking sets of retrieval runs. Threshold values for the coefficient have been defined and used in a number of published studies in information retrieval. However, this poster presents results showing that basing decisions on such thresholds is not as reliableas has been assumed.
1277936	Opinion holder extraction from author and authority viewpoints Opinion holder extraction research is important for discriminating between opinions that are viewed from different perspectives. In this paper, we describe our experience of participation in the NTCIR-6 Opinion Analysis Pilot Task by focusing on opinion holder extraction results in Japanese and English. Our approach to opinion holder extraction was based on the discrimination between author and authority viewpoints in opinionated sentences, and the evaluation results were fair with respect to the Japanese documents.
1277937	Incorporating term dependency in the dfr framework Term dependency, or co-occurrence, has been studied in language modelling, for instance by Metzler & Croft who showed that retrieval performance could be significantlyenhanced using term dependency information. In this work, weshow how term dependency can be modelled within the Divergence From Randomness (DFR) framework. We evaluate our term dependency model on the two adhoc retrieval tasks using the TREC .GOV2 Terabyte collection. Furthermore, we examine the effect of varying the term dependency window size on the retrieval performance of the proposed model. Our experiments show that term dependency can indeed besuccessfully incorporated within the DFR framework.
1277938	Hits on question answer portals: exploration of link analysis for author ranking Question-Answer portals such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers are growing in popularity. However, despite the increased popularity, the quality of answers is uneven, and while some users usually provide good answers, many others often provide bad answers. Hence, estimating the authority, or the expected quality of users, is a crucial task for this emerging domain, with potential applications to answer ranking and to incentive mechanism design. We adapt a powerful link analysis methodology from the web domain as a first step towards estimating authority in Question Answer portals. Our experimental results over more than 3 million answers from Yahoo! Answers are promising, and warrant further exploration along the lines outlined in this poster.
1277939	Heads and tails: studies of web search with common and rare queries A large fraction of queries submitted to Web search enginesoccur very infrequently. We describe search log studiesaimed at elucidating behaviors associated with rare andcommon queries. We present several analyses and discussresearch directions.
1277940	Dimensionality reduction for dimension-specific search Dimensionality reduction plays an important role in efficient similarity search, which is often based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries over a high-dimensional feature space. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of k-NN query, namely conditional k-NN (ck-NN), which considers dimension-specific constraint in addition to the inter-point distances. However, existing dimensionality reduction methods are not applicable to this new type of queries. We propose a novel Mean-Std (standard deviation) guided Dimensionality Reduction (MSDR) to support a pruning based efficient ck-NN query processing strategy. Our preliminary experimental results on 3D protein structure data demonstrate that the MSDR method is promising.
1277941	An effective method for finding best entry points in semi-structured documents Focused structured document retrieval employs the concept of best entry point (BEP), which is intended to provide optimal starting-point from which users can browse to relevant document components [4]. In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for finding BEPs in XML documents. Experiments conducted within the framework of INEX 2006 evaluation campaign on the Wikipedia XML collection [2] shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1277942	Query rewriting using active learning for sponsored search Sponsored search is a major revenue source for search companies. Web searchers can issue any queries, while advertisement keywords are limited. Query rewriting technique effectively matches user queries with relevant advertisement keywords, thus increases the amount of web advertisements available. The match relevance is critical for clicks. In this study, we aim to improve query rewriting relevance. For this purpose, we use an active learning algorithm called Transductive Experimental Design to select the most informative samples to train the query rewriting relevance model. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves model accuracy and rewriting relevance.
1277943	An analysis of peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries Many studies focus on the Web, but yet, few focus on peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries despite their massive scale in terms of Internet traffic. We analyzed several million queries collected on the Gnutella network and differentiated our findings from those of Web queries.
1277944	Investigating the relevance of sponsored results for web ecommerce queries Are sponsored links, the primary business model for Web search engines, providing Web consumers with relevant results? This research addresses this issue by investigating the relevance of sponsored and non-sponsored links for ecommerce queries from the major search engines. The results show that average relevance ratings for sponsored and non-sponsored links are virtually the same, although the relevance ratings for sponsored links are statistically higher. We used 108 ecommerce queries and 8,256 retrieved links for these queries from three major Web search engines, Google, MSN, and Yahoo!. We present the implications for Web search engines and sponsored search as a long-term business model as well as a mechanism for finding relevant information for searchers.
1277945	Viewing online searching within a learning paradigm In this research, we investigate whether one can model online searching as a learning paradigm. We examined the searching characteristics of 41 participants engaged in 246 searching tasks. We classified the searching tasks according to Anderson and Krathwohl's Taxonomy, an updated version of Bloom's taxonomy. Anderson and Krathwohl is a six level categorization of cognitive learning. Research results show that Applying takes the most searching effort as measured by queries per session and specific topics searched per sessions. The categories of Remembering and Understanding, which are lower-order learning levels, exhibit searching characteristics similar to the higher order categories of Evaluating and Creating. It seems that searchers rely primarily on their internal knowledge and use searching primarily as fact checking and verification when engaged in Evaluating and Creating. Implications are that the commonly held notions of Web searchers having simple information goals may not be correct. We discuss the implications for Web searching, including designing interfaces to support exploration and alternate views.
1277946	More efficient parallel computation of pagerank An abstract is not available.
1277947	Using similarity links as shortcuts to relevant web pages Successful navigation from a relevant web page to other relevant pages depends on the page linking to other relevant pages. We measured the distance to travel from relevant page to relevant page and found a bimodal distribution of distances peaking at 4 and 15 hops. In an attempt to make it easier to navigate among relevant pages, we added content similarity links to pages. With these additional links, significantly more relevant documents were close to each other. A browser plug-in or other tool that provides links to pages similar to a given page should increase the ability of web users to find relevant pages via navigation.
1277948	Fast exact maximum likelihood estimation for mixture of language models A common language modeling approach assumes the data D is generated from a mixture of several language models. EM algorithm is usually used to find the maximum likelihood estimation of one unknown mixture component, given the mixture weights and the other language models. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm of O ( k ) complexity to find the exact solution, where k is the number of words occurred at least once in D . Another merit is that the probabilities of many words are exactly zeros, which means that the mixture language model also serves as a feature selection technique.
1277949	TimedTextRank: adding the temporal dimension to multi-document summarization Graph-ranking based algorithms (e.g. TextRank) have been proposed for multi-document summarization in recent years. However, these algorithms miss an important dimension, the temporal dimension, for summarizing evolving topics. For an evolving topic, recent documents are usually more important than earlier documents because recent documents contain much more novel information than earlier documents and a novelty-oriented summary should be more appropriate to reflect the changing topic. We propose the TimedTextRank algorithm to make use of the temporal information of documents based on the graph-ranking based algorithm. A preliminary study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TimedTextRank algorithm for dynamic multi-document summarization.
1277950	Winnowing wheat from the chaff: propagating trust to sift spam from the web The Web today includes many pages intended to deceive search engines, and attain an unwarranted result ranking. Since the links among web pages are used to calculate authority, ranking systems would benefit from knowing which pages contain content to be trusted and which do not. We propose and compare various trust propagation methods to estimate the trustworthiness of each page. We find that a non-trust-preserving propagation method is able to achieve close to a fifty percent improvement over TrustRank in separating spam from non-spam pages.
1277951	Feature engineering for mobile (SMS) spam filtering Mobile spam in an increasing threat that may be addressed using filtering systems like those employed against email spam. We believe that email filtering techniques require some adaptation to reach good levels of performance on SMS spam, especially regarding message representation. In order to test this assumption, we have performed experiments on SMS filtering using top performing email spam filters on mobile spam messages using a suitable feature representation, with results supporting our hypothesis.
1277952	Ranking by community relevance A web page may be relevant to multiple topics; even when nominally on a single topic, the page may attract attention (and thus links) from multiple communities. Instead of indiscriminately summing the authority provided by all pages, we decompose a web page into separate subnodes with respect to each community pointing to it. By considering the relevance of these communities, we are able to better model the query-specific reputation for each potential result. We apply a total of 125 queries to the TREC .GOV dataset to demonstrate how the use of community relevance can improve ranking performance.
1277953	Query suggestion based on user landing pages This poster investigates a novel query suggestion technique that selects query refinements through a combination of many users' post-query navigation patterns and the query logs of a large search engine. We compare this technique, which uses the queries that retrieve in the top-ranked search results places where searchers end up after post-query browsing (i.e., the landing pages), with an approach based on query refinements from user search sessions extracted from query logs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using landing pages for the direct generation of query suggestions, as well as the complementary nature of the suggestions it generates with regard to traditional query log based refinement methodologies.
1277954	Making mind and machine meet: a study of combining cognitive and algorithmic relevance feedback Using Saracevic's relevance types, we explore approaches to combining algorithm and cognitive relevance in a term relevance feedback scenario. Data collected from 21 users who provided relevance feedback about terms suggested by a system for 50 TREC HARD topics are used. The former type of feedback is considered as cognitive relevance and the latter type is considered as algorithm relevance. We construct retrieval runs using these two types of relevance feedback and experiment with ways of combining them with simple Boolean operators. Results show minimal differences in performance with respect to the different techniques.
1277955	Using collaborative queries to improve retrieval for difficult topics We describe a preliminary analysis of queries created by 81 users for 4 topics from the TREC Robust Track. Our goal was to explore the potential benefits of using queries created by multiple users on retrieval performance for difficult topics. We first examine the overlap in users' queries and the overlap in results with respect to different queries for the same topic. We then explore the potential benefits of combining users' queries in various ways. Our results provide some evidence that having access to multiple users' queries can improve retrieval for individual searchers and for difficult topics.
1277956	Retrieval of discussions from enterprise mailing lists Mailing list archives in an enterprise are a valuable source for employees to dig into the past proceedings of the organization that could be relevant to their present task. Going through the proceedings of discussions about certain topics might be cumbersome and regular search techniques might not work in this context due to the genre that the documents belong to. In this paper, we propose methods, based on theory of subjectivity, to retrieve email messages that could contain argumentative discussions about the topic that the user is interested in.
1277957	Effects of highly agreed documents in relevancy prediction Finding significant contextual features is a challenging task in the development of interactive information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper investigated a simple method to facilitate such a task by looking at aggregated relevance judgements of retrieved documents. Our study suggested that the agreement on relevance judgements can indicate the effectiveness of retrieved documents as the source of significant features. The effect of highly agreed documents gives us practical implication for the design of adaptive search models in interactive IR systems.
1277958	Detecting word substitutions: PMI vs. HMM Those who want to conceal the content of their communications can do so by replacing words that might trigger attention. For example, instead of writing "The bomb is in position", a terrorist may chose to write "The flower is in position." The substituted sentence would sound a bit "odd" for a human reader and it has been shown in prior research that such oddity is detectable by text mining approaches. However, the importance of each component in the suggested oddity detection approach has not been thoroughly investigated. Also, the approach has not been compared with such an obvious candidate for the task as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In this work, we explore further oddity detection algorithms reported earlier, specifically those based on pointwise mutual information (PMI) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
1277959	Workload sampling for enterprise search evaluation In real world use of test collection methods, it is essential that the query test set be representative of the work load expected in the actual application. Using a random sample of queries from a media company's query log as a 'gold standard' test set we demonstrate that biases in sitemap-derived and top n query sets can lead to significant perturbations in engine rankings and big differences in estimated performance levels.
1277960	Document layout and color driven image retrieval This paper presents a contribution to image indexing applied to the document creation task. The presented method ranks a set of photographs based on how well they aesthetically work within a predefined document. Color harmony, document visual balance and image quality are taken into consideration. A user study conducted on people with a range of expertise in document creation helped gather the right visual features to consider by the algorithm. This shows some benefits for the traditional document creation task, as well as for the case of ever-changing web page banner colors and layout.
1277961	Large-scale cluster-based retrieval experiments on Turkish texts We present cluster-based retrieval (CBR) experiments on the largest available Turkish document collection. Our experiments evaluate retrieval effectiveness and efficiency on both an automatically generated clustering structure and a manual classification of documents. In particular, we compare CBR effectiveness with full-text search (FS) and evaluate several implementation alternatives for CBR. Our findings reveal that CBR yields comparable effectiveness figures with FS. Furthermore, by using a specifically tailored cluster-skipping inverted index we significantly improve in-memory query processing efficiency of CBR in comparison to other traditional CBR techniques and even FS.
1277962	Improving active learning recall via disjunctive boolean constraints Active learning efficiently hones in on the decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant documents, but in the process can miss entire clusters of relevant documents, yielding classifiers with low recall. In this paper, we propose a method to increase active learning recall by constraining sampling to a document subset rich in relevant examples.
1277963	Creativity support: information discovery and exploratory search We are developing support for creativity in learning through information discovery and exploratory search. Users engage in creative tasks, such as inventing new products and services. The system supports evolving information needs. It gathers and presents relevant information visually using images and text. Users are able to search, browse, and explore results from multiple queries and interact with information elements by manipulating design and expressing interest. A field study was conducted to evaluate the system in an undergraduate class. The results demonstrated the efficacy of our system for developing creative ideas. Exposure to diverse information in visual and interactive forms is shown to support students engaged in invention tasks.

User modeling in ISKODOR fills three roles: discovery of sites with suitable information stores, context-based query interpretation, and automatic profile-based filtering of new information. Explanation and control are achieved through graphical depiction of sources, explicit feedback regard ingutility, and explicit control over peer association behavior and information sharing.

1277968	X-Site: a workplace search tool for software engineers Professionals in the workplace need high-precision search tools capable of retrieving information that is useful and appropriate to the task at hand. One approach to identifying content, which is not only relevant but also useful, is to make use of the task context of the search. We present X-Site, an enterprise search engine for the software engineering domain that exploits relationships between user's tasks and document genres in the collection to improve retrieval precision.
1277969	The wild thing goes local Suppose you are on a mobile device with no keyboard (e.g., a cell phone) and you want to perform a "near me" search. Where is the nearest pizza? How do you enter queries quickly? T9? The Wild Thing encourages users to enter patterns with implicit and explicit wild cards (regular expressions). The search engine uses Microsoft Local Live logs to find the most likely queries for a particular location. For example, 7#6 is short-hand for the regular expression: /^[PQRS].*[ ][MNO].*/, which matches "post office" in many places (but "Space Needle" in Seattle). Some queries are more local than others. Pizza is likely everywhere, whereas "Boeing Company," is very likely in Seattle and Chicago, moderately likely nearby, and somewhat likely elsewhere. Smoothing is important. Not every query is observed everywhere.

1277975	Text categorization for streams We describe a novel system for evaluating and performing stream-based text categorization. Stream-based text categorization considers the text being categorized as a stream of symbols, which differs from the traditional feature-based approach which relies on extracting features from the text. The system implements character-based languages models--specifically models based on the PPM text compression scheme--as well as count-based measures such as R-Measure and C-Measure. Use of the system demonstrates that all of these techniques outperform SVM, a feature-based classifier, at stream-related classification tasks such as authorship ascription.

1277977	Wikipedia in the pocket: indexing technology for near-duplicate detection and high similarity search We develop and implement a new indexing technology which allows us to use complete (and possibly very large) documents as queries, while having a retrieval performance comparable to a standard term query. Our approach aims at retrieval tasks such as near duplicate detection and high similarity search. To demonstrate the performance of our technology we have compiled the search index "Wikipedia in the Pocket", which contains about 2 million English and German Wikipedia articles. 1 This index--along with a search interface--fits on a conventional CD (0.7 gigabyte). The ingredients of our indexing technology are similarity hashing and minimal perfect hashing.

1277979	Geographic ranking for a local search engine Traditional ranking schemes of the relevance of a Web page to a user query in a search engine are less appropriate when the search term contains geographic information. Often, geographic entities, such as addresses, city names, and location names, appear only once or twice in a Web page, and are typically not in a heading or larger font. Consequently, an alternative ranking approach to the traditional weighted tf*idf relevance ranking is need. Further, if a Web site contains a geographic entity, it is often the case that its in- and out-neighbours do not refer to the same entity, although they may refer to other geographic entities. We present a local search engine that applies a novel ranking algorithm suitable for ranking Web pages with geographic content. We describe its major components: geographic ranking, focused crawling, geographic extractor, and the related web-sites feature.
1277980	Focused ranking in a vertical search engine Since the debut of PageRank and HITS, hyperlink-induced Web document ranking has come a long way. The Web has become increasingly vast and topically diverse. Such vastness has led many into the area of topic-sensitive ranking and its variants. We address the high dimensionality of the Web by providing tools for focused search. A focused search engine is one which seeks coverage over a subset of topics of the Web and presents users with relevant search results in a known domain. This demonstration will introduce readers to the GenieKnows.com Vertical Search Engine.

1277984	Beyond classical measures: how to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive information retrieval system? This research explores the relationship between Information Retrieval (IR) systems' effectiveness and users' performance (accuracy and speed) and their satisfaction with the retrieved results (precision of the results, completeness of the results and overall system success). Previous studies have concluded that improvements in IR systems based on increase in IR effectiveness measures do not reflect on improvement in users' performance. This work aims at exploiting factors that can possibly be considered as confounding variables in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) evaluation. In this research, we look at substantive approaches to evaluate IIR systems. We aim to build an interactive evaluation framework that brings together aspects of systems' effectiveness and users' performance and satisfaction. This research also involves developing methods for capturing users' satisfaction with the retrieved results of IR systems, as well as examination how users assess their own performance in task completion. Furthermore, we are also interested in identifying evaluation measures which are used in batch mode (non-interactive experiment), but correlate well in interactive IR system. Thus, by the end of this research, we hope to develop a valid and reliable metrics for IIR evaluation. A first study was set up to explore the relationship between system effectiveness as quantified by traditional measures, such as precision and recall, and users' effectiveness and satisfaction of the results, though this study was limited to few users. The tasks involve finding images for recall-based tasks. It was concluded that no direct relationship between system effectiveness and users' performance. People learn to adapt to a system regardless to its effectiveness. This study recommends that a combination of measures (e.g. system effectiveness, user performance and satisfaction) to be used to evaluate IIR systems. Based on our observation from this study, we found that users' familiarity of the search topic has increased their performance. Thus, we set up a second experiment to investigate how users' satisfaction correlate with some IR effectiveness measures such as precision and the suite of Cumulative Gain measures (CG, DCG, NDCG) in simple web searching tasks. Results from this study have shown that CG and Precision are better than NDCG at reflecting users' satisfaction with the results of an IR system. We have also concluded that users of web search engines, in the context of simple search task, are more concerned with precision than completeness of the search. This stemmed from the stronger correlation between users' satisfaction with the success of overall search and their satisfaction with the accuracy of the search results than with their satisfaction with the completeness of the search. Many scholars such as [1], [2], [3], and [4] have recommended considering perceptions of the users as important as IR effectiveness measures, and both should be interpreted as measures of effectiveness. Therefore, the issue in IIR evaluation should not be focusing on maximizing the retrieval performance, by refining IR techniques alone, but also understanding users' satisfaction, behaviors and information needs. This raises the need for more investigation on measures that translate users' performance and satisfaction as the criterion of a system. Future plans are to incorporate variables domain knowledge, motivation, task complexity and search behaviours on user performance and users evaluation of IR system performance when evaluating interactive IR systems; this is in an attempt to explore the suitability of different measures in IIR evaluation. Thus, the proposed approach adopts a systematic and multidimensional approach to evaluation including not only classical traditional evaluation measures, such as precision and recall, but also interactive non-traditional measures, such as users' characteristics and their satisfaction.

1277988	A summarisation logic for structured documents The logical approach to Information Retrieval tries to model the relevance of a document given a query as the logical implication between documents and queries. In early work, van Rijsbergen states that the retrieval status value of a document given a query is proportional to the degree of implication between a document and a query. Based on this, several probabilistic logics for information retrieval have been conceived, which add an additional layer of abstraction to the information retrieval task: probabilistic models for the retrieval of documents are expressed in those logics, rather than implemented directly. The aim of the research presented here is to develop a logic for the IR task of document summarisation. Such a summarisation logic adds an abstraction layer to the summarisation task, similarly to the way a logic for document retrieval adds a layer to the retrieval task. Probabilistic models for document summarisation will thus be expressed as logical formulae, with the actual implementation hidden by the logical expressions. The "extract-worthyness" of textual components in this logic is measured as the degree of implication from those textual components to their surrounding contexts, providing a measure of how much said components are "about" the context within which they are situated.
1277989	Information-behaviour modeling with external cues Much of human activity defines an information context. We awaken, start work, and hold meetings at roughly the same time every day, and retrieve the same information items (day planners, itineraries, schedules, agendas, reports, menus, web pages, etc.) for many of these activities. Information retrieval systems in general lack sensitivity to such recurrent context, requiring users to remember and re-enter search cues for objects regardless of how regularly or consistently the objects are used, and to develop ad-hoc storage strategies. We propose that in addition to semantic cues, information objects should also be indexed by temporal and sensory cues, such as clock time and location, so that objects can be retrieved by external environmental context, in addition to any internal semantic content. Our cue-event-object (CEO) model uses a network representation to associate information objects with the times and conditions (location, weather, etc.) when they are typically used. Users can query the system to review their activities, revealing what they do at particular times, and which information objects tend to be most often used and when. The system can also pre-fetch items that have proven useful in past similar situations. The CEO model is incremental, real-time, and dynamic, maintaining an accurate summary even as a user's information behaviour changes over time. Such environmentally-aware systems have applications in personal information management, mobile devices, and smart homes. As a memory prosthesis, the model can support autonomous living for the cognitively impaired. We present a comprehensive research agenda based on some promising preliminary findings.
1277990	Fuzzy temporal and spatial reasoning for intelligent information retrieval Temporal and spatial information in text documents is often expressed in a qualitative way. Moreover, both are frequently affected by vagueness, calling for appropriate extensions of traditional frameworks for qualitative reasoning about time and space. Our research aims at defining such extensions based on fuzzy set theory, and applying the resulting frameworks to two important kinds of intelligent information retrieval, viz. temporal question answering and geographic information retrieval.

1277992	Global resources for peer-to-peer text retrieval The thesis presented in this paper tackles selected issues in unstructured peer-to-peer information retrieval (P2PIR) systems, using world knowledge for solving P2PIR problems. A first part uses so-called reference corpora for estimating global term weights such as IDF instead of sampling them from the distributed collection. A second part of the work will be dedicated to the question of query routing in unstructured P2PIR systems using peer resource descriptions and world knowledge for query expansion.
1277993	Automatic query-time generation of retrieval expert coefficients for multimedia retrieval Content-based Multimedia Information Retrieval can be defined as the task of matching a multi-modal information need against various components of a multimedia corpus and retrieving relevant elements. Generally the matching and retrieval takes place across multiple 'features' which can either be visual or audio, or can be high-level or low-level, and each of which can be seen to be an independent retrieval expert. The task of answering a query can thus be formulated as a data fusion problem. Depending on the query, each expert may perform differently and so retrieval coefficients can be used to weight each expert to increase overall performance. Previous approaches to expert coefficient generation have included query-independent coefficients, identification of query-classes and machine learning methods, to name a few. The approach I propose is different, as it seeks to dynamically create expert coefficients which are query-dependent. This approach is based upon earlier experiments where an initial correlation was observed between the score distribution of a retrieval expert, and its relative performance when compared against other experts for that query. I have created a basic method which leverages these observations to create query-time coefficients which achieve comparable performance to oracle-determined query-independent weights, for the experts and collections used in the aforementioned experiment. Previous research which examinedscore distribution did so with respect to relevance, whereas this work seeks to compare expert scores for a given query to determine relative performance. In my work I aim to explore this correlation by eliminating potential bias from the data collections, the retrieval experts and the queries used in experiments to obtain more robust observations. Using and extending previous investigations into data fusion, I will explore where data fusion succeeds in multimedia retrieval, and where it does not. I then aim to refine and extend my existing techniques for automatic coefficient generation to incorporate the new observations, so as to improve performance. Finally I will combine this approach with existing data fusion methods, such as query-class coefficients, with each approach complimenting the other to achieve further performance improvements.
1390335	Delighting Chinese users: the Google China experience Google entered China market as a late-comer in late-2005, with no local employees, an inadequate product line, and small market share. This talk will discuss Google China's efforts to build up a team, learn about local user needs, apply its global innovation model, and won over users in the past 2.5 years. This talk will cover the results of our user studies, and our key findings about Chinese users for searching and using the Internet. It will also discuss how these findings were applied to our products, and how these products gained traction in the market place. It will also discuss Google's progress in Chinese search relevance, search user experience, and key technology areas where we innovated. This talk will also discuss the process of internationalization - how Google hired locally, and applied its global 20% project approach to encourage truly relevant local innovations. It will discuss several examples of these innovations - from product innovations like the weather map, the input method editor, SMS greetings search, to research innovations like parallel SVM/SVD. Google China's progress dispelled the myth that multinational Internet companies cannot succeed in China. The key ingredients, like in any other success story, are: focus on the customer, embrace the corporate culture, empower local flexibility, and of course, innovate, innovate, innovate.
1390336	Guilt by association as a search principle The exploitation of fundamental invariants is among the most elegant solutions to many computational problems in a wide variety of domains. One of the more powerful approaches to exploit invariants is the principle of "guilt by association". In particular, the principle of guilt by association is the foundation of remote homolog detection, protein function prediction, disease subtype diagnosis, treatment plan prognosis, and other challenges in computational biology. The principle suggests that two entities are in a specific relationship if they exhibit invariant properties underlying that relationship. For example, a protein is predicted to have a particular biological function if it exhibits the underlying invariant properties of that functional group---viz., guilty by association to other members of that functional group through the shared invariant properties. In my talk, I plan to present several facets of guilt by association in the computational prediction of protein function and draw parallels of these facets in information retrieval. Specifically, I plan to touch on the following facets: (a) the issue of chance associations; (b) novel generalizable forms of association; (c) fusion of multiple heterogeneous sources of evidence; (d) the dichotomy of knowing to a high degree of reliability that two entities are in some relationship and yet not knowing what that relationship is. I hope this talk will be, for the informational retrieval community, a window to the opportunities in computational biology that may benefit from the depth and variety of solutions information retrieval has to offer.
1390338	On iterative intelligent medical search Searching for medical information on the Web has become highly popular, but it remains a challenging task because searchers are often uncertain about their exact medical situations and unfamiliar with medical terminology. To address this challenge, we have built an intelligent medical Web search engine called iMed, which uses medical knowledge and an interactive questionnaire to help searchers form queries. This paper focuses on iMed's iterative search advisor, which integrates medical and linguistic knowledge to help searchers improve search results iteratively. Such an iterative process is common for general Web search, and especially crucial for medical Web search, because searchers often miss desired search results due to their limited medical knowledge and the task's inherent difficulty. iMed's iterative search advisor helps the searcher in several ways. First, relevant symptoms and signs are automatically suggested based on the searcher's description of his situation. Second, instead of taking for granted the searcher's answers to the questions, iMed ranks and recommends alternative answers according to their likelihoods of being the correct answers. Third, related MeSH medical phrases are suggested to help the searcher refine his situation description. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iMed's iterative search advisor by evaluating it using real medical case records and USMLE medical exam questions.
1390339	Effective and efficient user interaction for long queries Handling long queries can involve either pruning the query to retain only the important terms (reduction), or expanding the query to include related concepts (expansion). While automatic techniques to do so exist, roughly 25% performance improvements in terms of MAP have been realized in past work through interactive variants. We show that selectively reducing or expanding a query leads to an average improvement of 51% in MAP over the baseline for standard TREC test collections. We demonstrate how user interaction can be used to achieve this improvement. Most interaction techniques present users with a fixed number of options for all queries. We achieve improvements by interacting less with the user, i.e., we present techniques to identify the optimal number of options to present to users, resulting in an interface with an average of 70% fewer options to consider. Previous algorithms supporting interactive reduction and expansion are exponential in nature. To extend their utility to operational environments, we present techniques to make the complexity of the algorithms polynomial. We finally present an analysis of long queries that continue to exhibit poor performance in spite of our new techniques.
1390340	How do users find things with PubMed?: towards automatic utility evaluation with user simulations In the context of document retrieval in the biomedical domain, this paper explores the complex relationship between the quality of initial query results and the overall utility of an interactive retrieval system. We demonstrate that a content-similarity browsing tool can compensate for poor retrieval results, and that the relationship between retrieval performance and overall utility is non-linear. Arguments are advanced with user simulations, which characterize the relevance of documents that a user might encounter with different browsing strategies. With broader implications to IR, this work provides a case study of how user simulations can be exploited as a formative tool for automatic utility evaluation. Simulation-based studies provide researchers with an additional evaluation tool to complement interactive and Cranfield-style experiments.
1390342	Towards breaking the quality curse.: a web-querying approach to web people search. Searching for people on the Web is one of the most common query types to the web search engines today. However, when a person name is queried, the returned webpages often contain documents related to several distinct namesakes who have the queried name. The task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person of interest is left to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches have been developed recently that attempt to automate this disambiguation process. Nevertheless, the disambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major room for improvement. This paper presents a new server-side WePS approach. It is based on collecting co-occurrence information from theWeb and thus it uses theWeb as an external data source. A skyline-based classification technique is developed for classifying the collected co-occurrence information in order to make clustering decisions. The clustering technique is specifically designed to (a) handle the dominance that exists in data and (b) to adapt to a given clustering quality measure. These properties allow the framework to get a major advantage in terms of result quality over all the latest WePS techniques we are aware of, including all the 18 methods covered in the recent WePS competition [2].
1390343	An unsupervised framework for extracting and normalizing product attributes from multiple web sites We have developed an unsupervised framework for simultaneously extracting and normalizing attributes of products from multiple Web pages originated from different sites. Our framework is designed based on a probabilistic graphical model that can model the page-independent content information and the page-dependent layout information of the text fragments in Web pages. One characteristic of our framework is that previously unseen attributes can be discovered from the clue contained in the layout format of the text fragments. Our framework tackles both extraction and normalization tasks by jointly considering the relationship between the content and layout information. Dirichlet process prior is employed leading to another advantage that the number of discovered product attributes is unlimited. An unsupervised inference algorithm based on variational method is presented. The semantics of the normalized attributes can be visualized by examining the term weights in the model. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of Web mining applications such as product matching and retrieval. We have conducted extensive experiments from four different domains consisting of over 300 Web pages from over 150 different Web sites, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our framework.
1390344	Enhancing web search by promoting multiple search engine use Any given Web search engine may provide higher quality results than others for certain queries. Therefore, it is in users' best interest to utilize multiple search engines. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework that maximizes users' search effective-ness by directing them to the engine that yields the best results for the current query. In contrast to prior work on meta-search, we do not advocate for replacement of multiple engines with an aggregate one, but rather facilitate simultaneous use of individual engines. We describe a machine learning approach to supporting switching between search engines and demonstrate its viability at tolerable interruption levels. Our findings have implications for fluid competition between search engines.
1390346	Score standardization for inter-collection comparison of retrieval systems The goal of system evaluation in information retrieval has always been to determine which of a set of systems is superior on a given collection. The tool used to determine system ordering is an evaluation metric such as average precision, which computes relative, collection-specific scores. We argue that a broader goal is achievable. In this paper we demonstrate that, by use of standardization, scores can be substantially independent of a particular collection, allowing systems to be compared even when they have been tested on different collections. Compared to current methods, our techniques provide richer information about system performance, improved clarity in outcome reporting, and greater simplicity in reviewing results from disparate sources.
1390347	The good and the bad system: does the test collection predict users' effectiveness? Test collections are extensively used in the evaluation of information retrieval systems. Crucial to their use is the degree to which results from them predict user effectiveness. At first, past studies did not substantiate a relationship between system and user effectiveness; more recently, however, correlations have begun to emerge. The results of this paper strengthen and extend those findings. We introduce a novel methodology for investigating the relationship, which shows great success in establishing a significant correlation between system and user effectiveness. It is shown that users behave differently and discern differences between pairs of systems that have a very small absolute difference in test collection effectiveness. Our results strengthen the use of test collections in IR evaluation, confirming that users' effectiveness can be predicted successfully.
1390348	Retrieval sensitivity under training using different measures Various measures, such as binary preference (bpref), inferred average precision (infAP), and binary normalised discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) have been proposed as alternatives to mean average precision (MAP) for being less sensitive to the relevance judgements completeness. As the primary aim of any system building is to train the system to respond to user queries in a more robust and stable manner, in this paper, we investigate the importance of the choice of the evaluation measure for training, under different levels of evaluation incompleteness. We simulate evaluation incompleteness by sampling from the relevance assessments. Through large-scale experiments on two standard TREC test collections, we examine retrieval sensitivity when training - i.e. if a training process, based on any of the four discussed measures has an impact on the final retrieval performance. Experimental results show that training by bpref, infAP and nDCG provides significantly better retrieval performance than training by MAP when relevance judgements completeness is extremely low. When relevance judgements completeness increases, the measures behave more similarly.
1390350	Attack resistant collaborative filtering The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit. While previous research has attempted to study the robustness of various existing Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches, this remains an unsolved problem. Approaches such as Neighbor Selection algorithms, Association Rules and Robust Matrix Factorization have produced unsatisfactory results. This work describes a new collaborative algorithm based on SVD which is accurate as well as highly stable to shilling. This algorithm exploits previously established SVD based shilling detection algorithms, and combines it with SVD based-CF. Experimental results show a much diminished effect of all kinds of shilling attacks. This work also offers significant improvement over previous Robust Collaborative Filtering frameworks.
1390351	EigenRank: a ranking-oriented approach to collaborative filtering A recommender system must be able to suggest items that are likely to be preferred by the user. In most systems, the degree of preference is represented by a rating score. Given a database of users' past ratings on a set of items, traditional collaborative filtering algorithms are based on predicting the potential ratings that a user would assign to the unrated items so that they can be ranked by the predicted ratings to produce a list of recommended items. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering approach that addresses the item ranking problem directly by modeling user preferences derived from the ratings. We measure the similarity between users based on the correlation between their rankings of the items rather than the rating values and propose new collaborative filtering algorithms for ranking items based on the preferences of similar users. Experimental results on real world movie rating data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional collaborative filtering algorithms significantly on the NDCG measure for evaluating ranked results.
1390352	Personalized active learning for collaborative filtering Collaborative Filtering (CF) requires user-rated training examples for statistical inference about the preferences of new users. Active learning strategies identify the most informative set of training examples through minimum interactions with the users. Current active learning approaches in CF make an implicit and unrealistic assumption that a user can provide rating for any queried item. This paper introduces a new approach to the problem which does not make such an assumption. We personalize active learning for the user, and query for only those items which the user can provide rating for. We propose an extended form of Bayesian active learning and use the Aspect Model for CF to illustrate and examine the idea. A comparative evaluation of the new method and a well-established baseline method on benchmark datasets shows statistically significant improvements with our method over the performance of the baseline method that is representative for existing approaches which do not take personalization into account.
1390354	A boosting algorithm for learning bipartite ranking functions with partially labeled data This paper presents a boosting based algorithm for learning a bipartite ranking function (BRF) with partially labeled data. Until now different attempts had been made to build a BRF in a transductive setting, in which the test points are given to the methods in advance as unlabeled data. The proposed approach is a semi-supervised inductive ranking algorithm which, as opposed to transductive algorithms, is able to infer an ordering on new examples that were not used for its training. We evaluate our approach using the TREC-9 Ohsumed and the Reuters-21578 data collections, comparing against two semi-supervised classification algorithms for ROCArea (AUC), uninterpolated average precision (AUP), mean precision@50 (TP) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves. In the most interesting cases where there are an unbalanced number of irrelevant examples over relevant ones, we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements with respect to these ranking measures.
1390355	Directly optimizing evaluation measures in learning to rank One of the central issues in learning to rank for information retrieval is to develop algorithms that construct ranking models by directly optimizing evaluation measures used in information retrieval such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Several such algorithms including SVM map and AdaRank have been proposed and their effectiveness has been verified. However, the relationships between the algorithms are not clear, and furthermore no comparisons have been conducted between them. In this paper, we conduct a study on the approach of directly optimizing evaluation measures in learning to rank for Information Retrieval (IR). We focus on the methods that minimize loss functions upper bounding the basic loss function defined on the IR measures. We first provide a general framework for the study and analyze the existing algorithms of SVM map and AdaRank within the framework. The framework is based on upper bound analysis and two types of upper bounds are discussed. Moreover, we show that we can derive new algorithms on the basis of this analysis and create one example algorithm called PermuRank. We have also conducted comparisons between SVM map , AdaRank, PermuRank, and conventional methods of Ranking SVM and RankBoost, using benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the methods based on direct optimization of evaluation measures can always outperform conventional methods of Ranking SVM and RankBoost. However, no significant difference exists among the performances of the direct optimization methods themselves.
1390356	Query dependent ranking using K-nearest neighbor Many ranking models have been proposed in information retrieval, and recently machine learning techniques have also been applied to ranking model construction. Most of the existing methods do not take into consideration the fact that significant differences exist between queries, and only resort to a single function in ranking of documents. In this paper, we argue that it is necessary to employ different ranking models for different queries and onduct what we call query-dependent ranking. As the first such attempt, we propose a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method for query-dependent ranking. We first consider an online method which creates a ranking model for a given query by using the labeled neighbors of the query in the query feature space and then rank the documents with respect to the query using the created model. Next, we give two offline approximations of the method, which create the ranking models in advance to enhance the efficiency of ranking. And we prove a theory which indicates that the approximations are accurate in terms of difference in loss of prediction, if the learning algorithm used is stable with respect to minor changes in training examples. Our experimental results show that the proposed online and offline methods both outperform the baseline method of using a single ranking function.
1390358	Asymmetric distance estimation with sketches for similarity search in high-dimensional spaces Efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces is important to content-based retrieval systems. Recent studies have shown that sketches can effectively approximate L 1 distance in high-dimensional spaces, and that filtering with sketches can speed up similarity search by an order of magnitude. It is a challenge to further reduce the size of sketches, which are already compact, without compromising accuracy of distance estimation. This paper presents an efficient sketch algorithm for similarity search with L 2 distances and a novel asymmetric distance estimation technique. Our new asymmetric estimator takes advantage of the original feature vector of the query to boost the distance estimation accuracy. We also apply this asymmetric method to existing sketches for cosine similarity and L 1 distance. Evaluations with datasets extracted from images and telephone records show that our L 2 sketch outperforms existing methods, and the asymmetric estimators consistently improve the accuracy of different sketch methods. To achieve the same search quality, asymmetric estimators can reduce the sketch size by 10% to 40%.
1390359	ResIn: a combination of results caching and index pruning for high-performance web search engines Results caching is an efficient technique for reducing the query processing load, hence it is commonly used in real search engines. This technique, however, bounds the maximum hit rate due to the large fraction of singleton queries, which is an important limitation. In this paper we propose ResIn - an architecture that uses a combination of res ults caching and in dex pruning to overcome this limitation. We argue that results caching is an inexpensive and efficient way to reduce the query processing load and show that it is cheaper to implement compared to a pruned index. At the same time, we show that index pruning performance is fundamentally affected by the changes in the query traffic that the results cache induces. We experiment with real query logs and a large document collection, and show that the combination of both techniques enables efficient reduction of the query processing costs and thus is practical to use in Web search engines.
1390360	Reorganizing compressed text Recent research has demonstrated beyond doubts the benefits of compressing natural language texts using word-based statistical semistatic compression. Not only it achieves extremely competitive compression rates, but also direct search on the compressed text can be carried out faster than on the original text; indexing based on inverted lists benefits from compression as well. Such compression methods assign a variable-length codeword to each different text word. Some coding methods (Plain Huffman and Restricted Prefix Byte Codes) do not clearly mark codeword boundaries, and hence cannot be accessed at random positions nor searched with the fastest text search algorithms. Other coding methods (Tagged Huffman, End-Tagged Dense Code, or ( s, c )-Dense Code) do mark codeword boundaries, achieving a self-synchronization property that enables fast search and random access, in exchange for some loss in compression effectiveness. In this paper, we show that by just performing a simple reordering of the target symbols in the compressed text (more precisely, reorganizing the bytes into a wavelet-treelike shape) and using little additional space, searching capabilities are greatly improved without a drastic impact in compression and decompression times. With this approach, all the codes achieve synchronism and can be searched fast and accessed at arbitrary points. Moreover, the reordered compressed text becomes an implicitly indexed representation of the text, which can be searched for words in time independent of the text length. That is, we achieve not only fast sequential search time, but indexed search time, for almost no extra space cost. We experiment with three well-known word-based compression techniques with different characteristics (Plain Huffman, End-Tagged Dense Code and Restricted Prefix Byte Codes), and show the searching capabilities achieved by reordering the compressed representation on several corpora. We show that the reordered versions are not only much more efficient than their classical counterparts, but also more efficient than explicit inverted indexes built on the collection, when using the same amount of space.
1390362	User adaptation: good results from poor systems Several recent studies have found only a weak relationship between the performance of a retrieval system and the "success" achievable by human searchers. We hypothesize that searchers are successful precisely because they alter their behavior. To explore the possible causal relation between system performance and search behavior, we control system performance, hoping to elicit adaptive search behaviors. 36 subjects each completed 12 searches using either a standard system or one of two degraded systems. Using a general linear model, we isolate the main effect of system performance, by measuring and removing main effects due to searcher variation, topic difficulty, and the position of each search in the time series. We find that searchers using our degraded systems are as successful as those using the standard system, but that, in achieving this success, they alter their behavior in ways that could be measured, in real time, by a suitably instrumented system. Our findings suggest, quite generally, that some aspects of behavioral dynamics may provide unobtrusive indicators of system performance.
1390363	Exploring folksonomy for personalized search As a social service in Web 2.0, folksonomy provides the users the ability to save and organize their bookmarks online with "social annotations" or "tags". Social annotations are high quality descriptors of the web pages' topics as well as good indicators of web users' interests. We propose a personalized search framework to utilize folksonomy for personalized search. Specifically, three properties of folksonomy, namely the categorization, keyword, and structure property, are explored. In the framework, the rank of a web page is decided not only by the term matching between the query and the web page's content but also by the topic matching between the user's interests and the web page's topics. In the evaluation, we propose an automatic evaluation framework based on folksonomy data, which is able to help lighten the common high cost in personalized search evaluations. A series of experiments are conducted using two heterogeneous data sets, one crawled from Del.icio.us and the other from Dogear. Extensive experimental results show that our personalized search approach can significantly improve the search quality.
1390364	To personalize or not to personalize: modeling queries with variation in user intent In most previous work on personalized search algorithms, the results for all queries are personalized in the same manner. However, as we show in this paper, there is a lot of variation across queries in the benefits that can be achieved through personalization. For some queries, everyone who issues the query is looking for the same thing. For other queries, different people want very different results even though they express their need in the same way. We examine variability in user intent using both explicit relevance judgments and large-scale log analysis of user behavior patterns. While variation in user behavior is correlated with variation in explicit relevance judgments the same query, there are many other factors, such as result entropy, result quality, and task that can also affect the variation in behavior. We characterize queries using a variety of features of the query, the results returned for the query, and people's interaction history with the query. Using these features we build predictive models to identify queries that can benefit from personalization.
1390366	The opposite of smoothing: a language model approach to ranking query-specific document clusters Exploiting information induced from (query-specific) clustering of top-retrieved documents has long been proposed as means for improving precision at the very top ranks of the returned results. We present a novel language model approach to ranking query-specific clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain. While most previous cluster ranking approaches focus on the cluster as a whole, our model also exploits information induced from documents associated with the cluster. Our model substantially outperforms previous approaches for identifying clusters containing a high relevant-document percentage. Furthermore, using the model to produce document ranking yields precision-at-top-ranks performance that is consistently better than that of the initial ranking upon which clustering is performed; the performance also favorably compares with that of a state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback retrieval method.
1390367	Enhancing text clustering by leveraging Wikipedia semantics Most traditional text clustering methods are based on "bag of words" ( BOW ) representation based on frequency statistics in a set of documents. BOW , however, ignores the important information on the semantic relationships between key terms. To overcome this problem, several methods have been proposed to enrich text representation with external resource in the past, such as WordNet. However, many of these approaches suffer from some limitations: 1) WordNet has limited coverage and has a lack of effective word-sense disambiguation ability; 2) Most of the text representation enrichment strategies, which append or replace document terms with their hypernym and synonym, are overly simple. In this paper, to overcome these deficiencies, we first propose a way to build a concept thesaurus based on the semantic relations (synonym, hypernym, and associative relation) extracted from Wikipedia. Then, we develop a unified framework to leverage these semantic relations in order to enhance traditional content similarity measure for text clustering. The experimental results on Reuters and OHSUMED datasets show that with the help of Wikipedia thesaurus, the clustering performance of our method is improved as compared to previous methods. In addition, with the optimized weights for hypernym, synonym, and associative concepts that are tuned with the help of a few labeled data users provided, the clustering performance can be further improved.
1390368	Knowledge transformation from word space to document space In most IR clustering problems, we directly cluster the documents, working in the document space, using cosine similarity between documents as the similarity measure. In many real-world applications, however, we usually have knowledge on the word side and wish to transform this knowledge to the document (concept) side. In this paper, we provide a mechanism for this knowledge transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model for such type of knowledge transformation. This model uses a nonnegative matrix factorization model X = FSG T , where X is the word document semantic matrix, F is the posterior probability of a word belonging to a word cluster and represents knowledge in the word space, G is the posterior probability of a document belonging to a document cluster and represents knowledge in the document space, and S is a scaled matrix factor which provides a condensed view of X . We show how knowledge on words can improve document clustering, i.e, knowledge in the word space is transformed into the document space. We perform extensive experiments to validate our approach.
1390370	A study of learning a merge model for multilingual information retrieval This paper proposes a learning approach for the merging process in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR). To conduct the learning approach, we also present a large number of features that may influence the MLIR merging process; these features are mainly extracted from three levels: query, document, and translation. After the feature extraction, we then use the FRank ranking algorithm to construct a merge model; to our knowledge, this practice is the first attempt to use a learning-based ranking algorithm to construct a merge model for MLIR merging. In our experiments, three test collections for the task of crosslingual information retrieval (CLIR) in NTCIR3, 4, and 5 are employed to assess the performance of our proposed method; moreover, several merging methods are also carried out for a comparison, including traditional merging methods, the 2-step merging strategy, and the merging method based on logistic regression. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve merging quality on two different types of datasets. In addition to the effectiveness, through the merge model generated by FRank, our method can further identify key factors that influence the merging process; this information might provide us more insight and understanding into MLIR merging.
1390371	Bilingual topic aspect classification with a few training examples This paper explores topic aspect (i.e., subtopic or facet) classification for English and Chinese collections. The evaluation model assumes a bilingual user who has found documents on a topic and identified a few passages in each language on aspects of that topic. Additional passages are then automatically labeled using a k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier and local (i.e., result set) Latent Semantic Analysis. Experiments show that when few training examples are available in either language, classification using training examples from both languages can often achieve higher effectiveness than using training examples from just one language. When the total number of training examples is held constant, classification effectiveness correlates positively with the fraction of same-language training examples in the training set. These results suggest that supervised classification can benefit from hand-annotating a few same-language examples, and that when performing classification in bilingual collections it is useful to label some examples in each language.
1390372	Crosslingual location search Address geocoding, the process of finding the map location for a structured postal address, is a relatively well-studied problem. In this paper we consider the more general problem of crosslingual location search, where the queries are not limited to postal addresses, and the language and script used in the search query is different from the one in which the underlying data is stored. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first crosslingual location search system that is able to geocode complex addresses. We use a statistical machine transliteration system to convert location names from the script of the query to that of the stored data. However, we show that it is not sufficient to simply feed the resulting transliterations into a monolingual geocoding system, as the ambiguity inherent in the conversion drastically expands the location search space and significantly lowers the quality of results. The strength of our approach lies in its integrated, end-to-end nature: we use abstraction and fuzzy search (in the text domain) to achieve maximum coverage despite transliteration ambiguities, while applying spatial constraints (in the geographic domain) to focus only on viable interpretations of the query. Our experiments with structured and unstructured queries in a set of diverse languages and scripts (Arabic, English, Hindi and Japanese) searching for locations in different regions of the world, show full crosslingual location search accuracy at levels comparable to that of commercial monolingual systems. We achieve these levels of performance using techniques that may be applied to crosslingual searches in any language/script, and over arbitrary spatial data.
1390374	A study of methods for negative relevance feedback Negative relevance feedback is a special case of relevance feedback where we do not have any positive example; this often happens when the topic is difficult and the search results are poor. Although in principle any standard relevance feedback technique can be applied to negative relevance feedback, it may not perform well due to the lack of positive examples. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of methods for negative relevance feedback. We compare a set of representative negative feedback methods, covering vector-space models and language models, as well as several special heuristics for negative feedback. Evaluating negative feedback methods requires a test set with sufficient difficult topics, but there are not many naturally difficult topics in the existing test collections. We use two sampling strategies to adapt a test collection with easy topics to evaluate negative feedback. Experiment results on several TREC collections show that language model based negative feedback methods are generally more effective than those based on vector-space models, and using multiple negative models is an effective heuristic for negative feedback. Our results also show that it is feasible to adapt test collections with easy topics for evaluating negative feedback methods through sampling.
1390375	A bayesian logistic regression model for active relevance feedback Relevance feedback, which traditionally uses the terms in the relevant documents to enrich the user's initial query, is an effective method for improving retrieval performance. The traditional relevance feedback algorithms lead to overfitting because of the limited amount of training data and large term space. This paper introduces an online Bayesian logistic regression algorithm to incorporate relevance feedback information. The new approach addresses the overfitting problem by projecting the original feature space onto a more compact set which retains the necessary information. The new set of features consist of the original retrieval score, the distance to the relevant documents and the distance to non-relevant documents. To reduce the human evaluation effort in ascertaining relevance, we introduce a new active learning algorithm based on variance reduction to actively select documents for user evaluation. The new active learning algorithm aims to select feedback documents to reduce the model variance. The variance reduction approach leads to capturing relevance, diversity and uncertainty of the unlabeled documents in a principled manner. These are the critical factors of active learning indicated in previous literature. Experiments with several TREC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1390376	A cluster-based resampling method for pseudo-relevance feedback Typical pseudo-relevance feedback methods assume the top-retrieved documents are relevant and use these pseudo-relevant documents to expand terms. The initial retrieval set can, however, contain a great deal of noise. In this paper, we present a cluster-based resampling method to select better pseudo-relevant documents based on the relevance model. The main idea is to use document clusters to find dominant documents for the initial retrieval set, and to repeatedly feed the documents to emphasize the core topics of a query. Experimental results on large-scale web TREC collections show significant improvements over the relevance model. For justification of the resampling approach, we examine relevance density of feedback documents. A higher relevance density will result in greater retrieval accuracy, ultimately approaching true relevance feedback. The resampling approach shows higher relevance density than the baseline relevance model on all collections, resulting in better retrieval accuracy in pseudo-relevance feedback. This result indicates that the proposed method is effective for pseudo-relevance feedback.
1390377	Selecting good expansion terms for pseudo-relevance feedback Pseudo-relevance feedback assumes that most frequent terms in the pseudo-feedback documents are useful for the retrieval. In this study, we re-examine this assumption and show that it does not hold in reality - many expansion terms identified in traditional approaches are indeed unrelated to the query and harmful to the retrieval. We also show that good expansion terms cannot be distinguished from bad ones merely on their distributions in the feedback documents and in the whole collection. We then propose to integrate a term classification process to predict the usefulness of expansion terms. Multiple additional features can be integrated in this process. Our experiments on three TREC collections show that retrieval effectiveness can be much improved when term classification is used. In addition, we also demonstrate that good terms should be identified directly according to their possible impact on the retrieval effectiveness, i.e. using supervised learning, instead of unsupervised learning.
1390379	Learning to rank with partially-labeled data Ranking algorithms, whose goal is to appropriately order a set of objects/documents, are an important component of information retrieval systems. Previous work on ranking algorithms has focused on cases where only labeled data is available for training (i.e. supervised learning). In this paper, we consider the question whether unlabeled (test) data can be exploited to improve ranking performance. We present a framework for transductive learning of ranking functions and show that the answer is affirmative. Our framework is based on generating better features from the test data (via KernelPCA) and incorporating such features via Boosting, thus learning different ranking functions adapted to the individual test queries. We evaluate this method on the LETOR (TREC, OHSUMED) dataset and demonstrate significant improvements.
1390380	Learning to rank with SoftRank and Gaussian processes In this paper we address the issue of learning to rank for document retrieval using Thurstonian models based on sparse Gaussian processes. Thurstonian models represent each document for a given query as a probability distribution in a score space; these distributions over scores naturally give rise to distributions over document rankings. However, in general we do not have observed rankings with which to train the model; instead, each document in the training set is judged to have a particular relevance level: for example "Bad", "Fair", "Good", or "Excellent". The performance of the model is then evaluated using information retrieval (IR) metrics such as Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Recently Taylor et al. presented a method called SoftRank which allows the direct gradient optimisation of a smoothed version of NDCG using a Thurstonian model. In this approach, document scores are represented by the outputs of a neural network, and score distributions are created artificially by adding random noise to the scores. The SoftRank mechanism is a general one; it can be applied to different IR metrics, and make use of different underlying models. In this paper we extend the SoftRank framework to make use of the score uncertainties which are naturally provided by a Gaussian process (GP), which is a probabilistic non-linear regression model. We further develop the model by using sparse Gaussian process techniques, which give improved performance and efficiency, and show competitive results against baseline methods when tested on the publicly available LETOR OHSUMED data set. We also explore how the available uncertainty information can be used in prediction and how it affects model performance.
1390381	Learning to rank at query-time using association rules Some applications have to present their results in the form of ranked lists. This is the case of many information retrieval applications, in which documents must be sorted according to their relevance to a given query. This has led the interest of the information retrieval community in methods that automatically learn effective ranking functions. In this paper we propose a novel method which uncovers patterns (or rules) in the training data associating features of the document with its relevance to the query, and then uses the discovered rules to rank documents. To address typical problems that are inherent to the utilization of association rules (such as missing rules and rule explosion), the proposed method generates rules on a demand-driven basis, at query-time. The result is an extremely fast and effective ranking method. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using the LETOR benchmark collections. We show that generating rules on a demand-driven basis can boost ranking performance, providing gains ranging from 12% to 123%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods that learn to rank, with no need of time-consuming and laborious pre-processing. As a highlight, we also show that additional information, such as query terms, can make the generated rules more discriminative, further improving ranking performance.
1390382	Learning to rank with ties Designing effective ranking functions is a core problem for information retrieval and Web search since the ranking functions directly impact the relevance of the search results. The problem has been the focus of much of the research at the intersection of Web search and machine learning, and learning ranking functions from preference data in particular has recently attracted much interest. The objective of this paper is to empirically examine several objective functions that can be used for learning ranking functions from preference data. Specifically, we investigate the roles of ties in the learning process. By ties, we mean preference judgments that two documents have equal degree of relevance with respect to a query. This type of data has largely been ignored or not properly modeled in the past. In this paper, we analyze the properties of ties and develop novel learning frameworks which combine ties and preference data using statistical paired comparison models to improve the performance of learned ranking functions. The resulting optimization problems explicitly incorporating ties and preference data are solved using gradient boosting methods. Experimental studies are conducted using three publicly available data sets which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new methods.
1390384	Query-sensitive mutual reinforcement chain and its application in query-oriented multi-document summarization Sentence ranking is the issue of most concern in document summarization. Early researchers have presented the mutual reinforcement principle (MR) between sentence and term for simultaneous key phrase and salient sentence extraction in generic single-document summarization. In this work, we extend the MR to the mutual reinforcement chain (MRC) of three different text granularities, i.e., document, sentence and terms. The aim is to provide a general reinforcement framework and a formal mathematical modeling for the MRC. Going one step further, we incorporate the query influence into the MRC to cope with the need for query-oriented multi-document summarization. While the previous summarization approaches often calculate the similarity regardless of the query, we develop a query-sensitive similarity to measure the affinity between the pair of texts. When evaluated on the DUC 2005 dataset, the experimental results suggest that the proposed query-sensitive MRC (Qs-MRC) is a promising approach for summarization.
1390385	Comments-oriented document summarization: understanding documents with readers' feedback Comments left by readers on Web documents contain valuable information that can be utilized in different information retrieval tasks including document search, visualization, and summarization. In this paper, we study the problem of comments-oriented document summarization and aim to summarize a Web document (e.g., a blog post) by considering not only its content, but also the comments left by its readers. We identify three relations (namely, topic, quotation, and mention ) by which comments can be linked to one another, and model the relations in three graphs. The importance of each comment is then scored by: (i) graph-based method , where the three graphs are merged into a multi-relation graph; (ii) tensor-based method , where the three graphs are used to construct a 3rd-order tensor. To generate a comments-oriented summary, we extract sentences from the given Web document using either feature-biased approach or uniform-document approach . The former scores sentences to bias keywords derived from comments; while the latter scores sentences uniformly with comments. In our experiments using a set of blog posts with manually labeled sentences, our proposed summarization methods utilizing comments showed significant improvement over those not using comments. The methods using feature-biased sentence extraction approach were observed to outperform that using uniform-document approach.
1390386	Multi-document summarization using cluster-based link analysis The Markov Random Walk model has been recently exploited for multi-document summarization by making use of the link relationships between sentences in the document set, under the assumption that all the sentences are indistinguishable from each other. However, a given document set usually covers a few topic themes with each theme represented by a cluster of sentences. The topic themes are usually not equally important and the sentences in an important theme cluster are deemed more salient than the sentences in a trivial theme cluster. This paper proposes the Cluster-based Conditional Markov Random Walk Model (ClusterCMRW) and the Cluster-based HITS Model (ClusterHITS) to fully leverage the cluster-level information. Experimental results on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets demonstrate the good effectiveness of our proposed summarization models. The results also demonstrate that the ClusterCMRW model is more robust than the ClusterHITS model, with respect to different cluster numbers.
1390387	Multi-document summarization via sentence-level semantic analysis and symmetric matrix factorization Multi-document summarization aims to create a compressed summary while retaining the main characteristics of the original set of documents. Many approaches use statistics and machine learning techniques to extract sentences from documents. In this paper, we propose a new multi-document summarization framework based on sentence-level semantic analysis and symmetric non-negative matrix factorization. We first calculate sentence-sentence similarities using semantic analysis and construct the similarity matrix. Then symmetric matrix factorization, which has been shown to be equivalent to normalized spectral clustering, is used to group sentences into clusters. Finally, the most informative sentences are selected from each group to form the summary. Experimental results on DUC2005 and DUC2006 data sets demonstrate the improvement of our proposed framework over the implemented existing summarization systems. A further study on the factors that benefit the high performance is also conducted.
1390389	Algorithmic mediation for collaborative exploratory search We describe a new approach to information retrieval: algorithmic mediation for intentional, synchronous collaborative exploratory search. Using our system, two or more users with a common information need search together, simultaneously. The collaborative system provides tools, user interfaces and, most importantly, algorithmically-mediated retrieval to focus, enhance and augment the team's search and communication activities. Collaborative search outperformed post hoc merging of similarly instrumented single user runs. Algorithmic mediation improved both collaborative search (allowing a team of searchers to find relevant information more efficiently and effectively), and exploratory search (allowing the searchers to find relevant information that cannot be found while working individually).
1390390	Exploiting correlated keywords to improve approximate information filtering Information filtering, also referred to as publish/subscribe, complements one-time searching since users are able to subscribe to information sources and be notified whenever new documents of interest are published. In approximate information filtering only selected information sources, that are likely to publish documents relevant to the user interests in the future, are monitored. To achieve this functionality, a subscriber exploits statistical metadata to identify promising publishers and index its continuous query only in those publishers. The statistics are maintained in a directory, usually on a per-keyword basis, thus disregarding possible correlations among keywords. Using this coarse information, poor publisher selection may lead to poor filtering performance and thus loss of interesting documents. 1 Based on the above observation, this work extends query routing techniques from the domain of distributed information retrieval in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and provides new algorithms for exploiting the correlation among keywords in a filtering setting. We develop and evaluate two algorithms based on single-key and multi-key statistics and utilize two different synopses (Hash Sketches and KMV synopses) to compactly represent publishers. Our experimental evaluation using two real-life corpora with web and blog data demonstrates the filtering effectiveness of both approaches and highlights the different tradeoffs.
1390392	A user browsing model to predict search engine click data from past observations. Search engine click logs provide an invaluable source of relevance information but this information is biased because we ignore which documents from the result list the users have actually seen before and after they clicked. Otherwise, we could estimate document relevance by simple counting. In this paper, we propose a set of assumptions on user browsing behavior that allows the estimation of the probability that a document is seen, thereby providing an unbiased estimate of document relevance. To train, test and compare our model to the best alternatives described in the Literature, we gather a large set of real data and proceed to an extensive cross-validation experiment. Our solution outperforms very significantly all previous models. As a side effect, we gain insight into the browsing behavior of users and we can compare it to the conclusions of an eye-tracking experiments by Joachims et al. [12]. In particular, our findings confirm that a user almost always see the document directly after a clicked document. They also explain why documents situated just after a very relevant document are clicked more often.
1390393	Learning query intent from regularized click graphs This work presents the use of click graphs in improving query intent classifiers, which are critical if vertical search and general-purpose search services are to be offered in a unified user interface. Previous works on query classification have primarily focused on improving feature representation of queries, e.g. , by augmenting queries with search engine results. In this work, we investigate a completely orthogonal approach --- instead of enriching feature representation, we aim at drastically increasing the amounts of training data by semi-supervised learning with click graphs. Specifically, we infer class memberships of unlabeled queries from those of labeled ones according to their proximities in a click graph. Moreover, we regularize the learning with click graphs by content-based classification to avoid propagating erroneous labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in two different applications, product intent and job intent classification. In both cases, we expand the training data with automatically labeled queries by over two orders of magnitude, leading to significant improvements in classification performance. An additional finding is that with a large amount of training data obtained in this fashion, classifiers using only query words/phrases as features can work remarkably well.
1390394	Retrieval and feedback models for blog feed search Blog feed search poses different and interesting challenges from traditional ad hoc document retrieval. The units of retrieval, the blogs, are collections of documents, the blog posts. In this work we adapt a state-of-the-art federated search model to the feed retrieval task, showing a significant improvement over algorithms based on the best performing submissions in the TREC 2007 Blog Distillation task[12]. We also show that typical query expansion techniques such as pseudo-relevance feedback using the blog corpus do not provide any significant performance improvement and in many cases dramatically hurt performance. We perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of pseudo-relevance feedback for this task and develop a novel query expansion technique using the link structure in Wikipedia. This query expansion technique provides significant and consistent performance improvements for this task, yielding a 22% and 14% improvement in MAP over the unexpanded query for our baseline and federated algorithms respectively.
1390396	Learning to reduce the semantic gap in web image retrieval and annotation We study in this paper the problem of bridging the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level semantic concepts, which is the key hindrance in content-based image retrieval. Piloted by the rich textual information of Web images, the proposed framework tries to learn a new distance measure in the visual space, which can be used to retrieve more semantically relevant images for any unseen query image. The framework differentiates with traditional distance metric learning methods in the following ways. 1) A ranking-based distance metric learning method is proposed for image retrieval problem, by optimizing the leave-one-out retrieval performance on the training data. 2) To be scalable, millions of images together with rich textual information have been crawled from the Web to learn the similarity measure, and the learning framework particularly considers the indexing problem to ensure the retrieval efficiency. 3) To alleviate the noises in the unbalanced labels of images and fully utilize the textual information, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation based topic-level text model is introduced to define pairwise semantic similarity between any two images. The learnt distance measure can be directly applied to applications such as content-based image retrieval and search-based image annotation. Experimental results on the two applications in a two million Web image database show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.
1390397	A lattice-based approach to query-by-example spoken document retrieval Recent efforts on the task of spoken document retrieval (SDR) have made use of speech lattices: speech lattices contain information about alternative speech transcription hypotheses other than the 1-best transcripts, and this information can improve retrieval accuracy by overcoming recognition errors present in the 1-best transcription. In this paper, we look at using lattices for the query-by-example spoken document retrieval task - retrieving documents from a speech corpus, where the queries are themselves in the form of complete spoken documents (query exemplars). We extend a previously proposed method for SDR with short queries to the query-by-example task. Specifically, we use a retrieval method based on statistical modeling: we compute expected word counts from document and query lattices, estimate statistical models from these counts, and compute relevance scores as divergences between these models. Experimental results on a speech corpus of conversational English show that the use of statistics from lattices for both documents and query exemplars results in better retrieval accuracy than using only 1-best transcripts for either documents, or queries, or both. In addition, we investigate the effect of stop word removal which further improves retrieval accuracy. To our knowledge, our work is the first to have used a lattice-based approach to query-by-example spoken document retrieval.
1390399	A few examples go a long way: constructing query models from elaborate query formulations We address a specific enterprise document search scenario, where the information need is expressed in an elaborate manner. In our scenario, information needs are expressed using a short query (of a few keywords) together with examples of key reference pages. Given this setup, we investigate how the examples can be utilized to improve the end-to-end performance on the document retrieval task. Our approach is based on a language modeling framework, where the query model is modified to resemble the example pages. We compare several methods for sampling expansion terms from the example pages to support query-dependent and query-independent query expansion; the latter is motivated by the wish to increase "aspect recall", and attempts to uncover aspects of the information need not captured by the query. For evaluation purposes we use the CSIRO data set created for the TREC 2007 Enterprise track. The best performance is achieved by query models based on query-independent sampling of expansion terms from the example documents.
1390400	A unified and discriminative model for query refinement This paper addresses the issue of query refinement, which involves reformulating ill-formed search queries in order to enhance relevance of search results. Query refinement typically includes a number of tasks such as spelling error correction, word splitting, word merging, phrase segmentation, word stemming, and acronym expansion. In previous research, such tasks were addressed separately or through employing generative models. This paper proposes employing a unified and discriminative model for query refinement. Specifically, it proposes a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model suitable for the problem, referred to as Conditional Random Field for Query Refinement (CRF-QR). Given a sequence of query words, CRF-QR predicts a sequence of refined query words as well as corresponding refinement operations. In that sense, CRF-QR differs greatly from conventional CRF models. Two types of CRF-QR models, namely a basic model and an extended model are introduced. One merit of employing CRF-QR is that different refinement tasks can be performed simultaneously and thus the accuracy of refinement can be enhanced. Furthermore, the advantages of discriminative models over generative models can be fully leveraged. Experimental results demonstrate that CRF-QR can significantly outperform baseline methods. Furthermore, when CRF-QR is used in web search, a significant improvement of relevance can be obtained.
1390401	Query expansion using gaze-based feedback on the subdocument level We examine the effect of incorporating gaze-based attention feedback from the user on personalizing the search process. Employing eye tracking data, we keep track of document parts the user read in some way. We use this information on the subdocument level as implicit feedback for query expansion and reranking. We evaluated three different variants incorporating gaze data on the subdocument level and compared them against a baseline based on context on the document level. Our results show that considering reading behavior as feedback yields powerful improvements of the search result accuracy of ca. 32% in the general case. However, the extent of the improvements varies depending on the internal structure of the viewed documents and the type of the current information need.
1390403	Affective feedback: an investigation into the role of emotions in the information seeking process User feedback is considered to be a critical element in the information seeking process, especially in relation to relevance assessment. Current feedback techniques determine content relevance with respect to the cognitive and situational levels of interaction that occurs between the user and the retrieval system. However, apart from real-life problems and information objects, users interact with intentions, motivations and feelings, which can be seen as critical aspects of cognition and decision-making. The study presented in this paper serves as a starting point to the exploration of the role of emotions in the information seeking process. Results show that the latter not only interweave with different physiological, psychological and cognitive processes, but also form distinctive patterns, according to specific task, and according to specific user.
1390404	Optimizing relevance and revenue in ad search: a query substitution approach The primary business model behind Web search is based on textual advertising, where contextually relevant ads are displayed alongside search results. We address the problem of selecting these ads so that they are both relevant to the queries and profitable to the search engine, showing that optimizing ad relevance and revenue is not equivalent. Selecting the best ads that satisfy these constraints also naturally incurs high computational costs, and time constraints can lead to reduced relevance and profitability. We propose a novel two-stage approach, which conducts most of the analysis ahead of time. An offine preprocessing phase leverages additional knowledge that is impractical to use in real time, and rewrites frequent queries in a way that subsequently facilitates fast and accurate online matching. Empirical evaluation shows that our method optimized for relevance matches a state-of-the-art method while improving expected revenue. When optimizing for revenue, we see even more substantial improvements in expected revenue.
1390405	A generation model to unify topic relevance and lexicon-based sentiment for opinion retrieval Opinion retrieval is a task of growing interest in social life and academic research, which is to find relevant and opinionate documents according to a user's query. One of the key issues is how to combine a document's opinionate score (the ranking score of to what extent it is subjective or objective) and topic relevance score. Current solutions to document ranking in opinion retrieval are generally ad-hoc linear combination, which is short of theoretical foundation and careful analysis. In this paper, we focus on lexicon-based opinion retrieval. A novel generation model that unifies topic-relevance and opinion generation by a quadratic combination is proposed in this paper. With this model, the relevance-based ranking serves as the weighting factor of the lexicon-based sentiment ranking function, which is essentially different from the popular heuristic linear combination approaches. The effect of different sentiment dictionaries is also discussed. Experimental results on TREC blog datasets show the significant effectiveness of the proposed unified model. Improvements of 28.1% and 40.3% have been obtained in terms of MAP and p@10 respectively. The conclusion is not limited to blog environment. Besides the unified generation model, another contribution is that our work demonstrates that in the opinion retrieval task, a Bayesian approach to combining multiple ranking functions is superior to using a linear combination. It is also applicable to other result re-ranking applications in similar scenario.
1390407	Discriminative probabilistic models for passage based retrieval The approach of using passage-level evidence for document retrieval has shown mixed results when it is applied to a variety of test beds with different characteristics. One main reason of the inconsistent performance is that there exists no unified framework to model the evidence of individual passages within a document. This paper proposes two probabilistic models to formally model the evidence of a set of top ranked passages in a document. The first probabilistic model follows the retrieval criterion that a document is relevant if any passage in the document is relevant, and models each passage independently. The second probabilistic model goes a step further and incorporates the similarity correlations among the passages. Both models are trained in a discriminative manner. Furthermore, we present a combination approach to combine the ranked lists of document retrieval and passage-based retrieval. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on four different TREC test beds to show the effectiveness of the proposed discriminative probabilistic models for passage-based retrieval. The proposed algorithms are compared with a state-of-the-art document retrieval algorithm and a language model approach for passage-based retrieval. Furthermore, our combined approach has been shown to provide better results than both document retrieval and passage-based retrieval approaches.
1390408	A new probabilistic retrieval model based on the dirichlet compound multinomial distribution The classical probabilistic models attempt to capture the Ad hoc information retrieval problem within a rigorous probabilistic framework. It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of the probabilistic models is the need to estimate a relevance model. The Dirichlet compound multinomial (DCM) distribution, which relies on hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques, or the Polya Urn scheme, is a more appropriate generative model than the traditional multinomial distribution for text documents. We explore a new probabilistic model based on the DCM distribution, which enables efficient retrieval and accurate ranking. Because the DCM distribution captures the dependency of repetitive word occurrences, the new probabilistic model is able to model the concavity of the score function more effectively. To avoid the empirical tuning of retrieval parameters, we design several parameter estimation algorithms to automatically set model parameters. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm based on the latent mixture modeling of the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution to further improve retrieval accuracy. Finally, our experiments show that both the baseline probabilistic retrieval algorithm based on the DCM distribution and the corresponding pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm outperform the existing language modeling systems on several TREC retrieval tasks.
1390409	TF-IDF uncovered: a study of theories and probabilities Interpretations of TF-IDF are based on binary independence retrieval, Poisson, information theory, and language modelling. This paper contributes a review of existing interpretations, and then, TF-IDF is systematically related to the probabilities P ( q | d ) and P ( d | q ). Two approaches are explored: a space of independent , and a space of disjoint terms. For independent terms, an "extreme" query/non-query term assumption uncovers TF-IDF, and an analogy of P ( d | q ) and the probabilistic odds O ( r | d , q ) mirrors relevance feedback. For disjoint terms, a relationship between probability theory and TF-IDF is established through the integral + 1/ x d x = log x . This study uncovers components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence (DQI) measure, and interestingly, an integral of the DQI over the term occurrence probability leads to TF-IDF.
1390411	Separate and inequal: preserving heterogeneity in topical authority flows Web pages, like people, are often known by others in a variety of contexts. When those contexts are sufficiently distinct, a page's importance may be better represented by multiple domains of authority, rather than by one that indiscriminately mixes reputations. In this work we determine domains of authority by examining the contexts in which a page is cited. However, we find that it is not enough to determine separate domains of authority; our model additionally determines the local flow of authority based upon the relative similarity of the source and target authority domains. In this way, we differentiate both incoming and outgoing hyperlinks by topicality and importance rather than treating them indiscriminately. We find that this approach compares favorably to other topical ranking methods on two real-world datasets and produces an approximately 10% improvement in precision and quality of the top ten results over PageRank.
1390412	BrowseRank: letting web users vote for page importance This paper proposes a new method for computing page importance, referred to as BrowseRank. The conventional approach to compute page importance is to exploit the link graph of the web and to build a model based on that graph. For instance, PageRank is such an algorithm, which employs a discrete-time Markov process as the model. Unfortunately, the link graph might be incomplete and inaccurate with respect to data for determining page importance, because links can be easily added and deleted by web content creators. In this paper, we propose computing page importance by using a 'user browsing graph' created from user behavior data. In this graph, vertices represent pages and directed edges represent transitions between pages in the users' web browsing history. Furthermore, the lengths of staying time spent on the pages by users are also included. The user browsing graph is more reliable than the link graph for inferring page importance. This paper further proposes using the continuous-time Markov process on the user browsing graph as a model and computing the stationary probability distribution of the process as page importance. An efficient algorithm for this computation has also been devised. In this way, we can leverage hundreds of millions of users' implicit voting on page importance. Experimental results show that BrowseRank indeed outperforms the baseline methods such as PageRank and TrustRank in several tasks.
1390413	Exploring traversal strategy for web forum crawling In this paper, we study the problem of Web forum crawling. Web forum has now become an important data source of many Web applications; while forum crawling is still a challenging task due to complex in-site link structures and login controls of most forum sites. Without carefully selecting the traversal path, a generic crawler usually downloads many duplicate and invalid pages from forums, and thus wastes both the precious bandwidth and the limited storage space. To crawl forum data more effectively and efficiently, in this paper, we propose an automatic approach to exploring an appropriate traversal strategy to direct the crawling of a given target forum. In detail, the traversal strategy consists of the identification of the skeleton links and the detection of the page-flipping links . The skeleton links instruct the crawler to only crawl valuable pages and meanwhile avoid duplicate and uninformative ones; and the page-flipping links tell the crawler how to completely download a long discussion thread which is usually shown in multiple pages in Web forums. The extensive experimental results on several forums show encouraging performance of our approach. Following the discovered traversal strategy, our forum crawler can archive more informative pages in comparison with previous related work and a commercial generic crawler.
1390415	Finding question-answer pairs from online forums Online forums contain a huge amount of valuable user generated content. In this paper we address the problem of extracting question-answer pairs from forums. Question-answer pairs extracted from forums can be used to help Question Answering services (e.g. Yahoo! Answers) among other applications. We propose a sequential patterns based classification method to detect questions in a forum thread, and a graph based propagation method to detect answers for questions in the same thread. Experimental results show that our techniques are very promising.
1390416	Retrieval models for question and answer archives Retrieval in a question and answer archive involves finding good answers for a user's question. In contrast to typical document retrieval, a retrieval model for this task can exploit question similarity as well as ranking the associated answers. In this paper, we propose a retrieval model that combines a translation-based language model for the question part with a query likelihood approach for the answer part. The proposed model incorporates word-to-word translation probabilities learned through exploiting different sources of information. Experiments show that the proposed translation based language model for the question part outperforms baseline methods significantly. By combining with the query likelihood language model for the answer part, substantial additional effectiveness improvements are obtained.
1390417	Predicting information seeker satisfaction in community question answering Question answering communities such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers have emerged as popular, and often effective, means of information seeking on the web. By posting questions for other participants to answer, information seekers can obtain specific answers to their questions. Users of popular portals such as Yahoo! Answers already have submitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants. However, it may also take hours --and sometime days-- until a satisfactory answer is posted. In this paper we introduce the problem of predicting information seeker satisfaction in collaborative question answering communities, where we attempt to predict whether a question author will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the community participants. We present a general prediction model, and develop a variety of content, structure, and community-focused features for this task. Our experimental results, obtained from a largescale evaluation over thousands of real questions and user ratings, demonstrate the feasibility of modeling and predicting asker satisfaction. We complement our results with a thorough investigation of the interactions and information seeking patterns in question answering communities that correlate with information seeker satisfaction. Our models and predictions could be useful for a variety of applications such as user intent inference, answer ranking, interface design, and query suggestion and routing.
1390419	Discovering key concepts in verbose queries Current search engines do not, in general, perform well with longer, more verbose queries. One of the main issues in processing these queries is identifying the key concepts that will have the most impact on effectiveness. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a technique that uses query-dependent, corpus-dependent, and corpus-independent features for automatic extraction of key concepts from verbose queries. We show that our method achieves higher accuracy in the identification of key concepts than standard weighting methods such as inverse document frequency. Finally, we propose a probabilistic model for integrating the weighted key concepts identified by our method into a query, and demonstrate that this integration significantly improves retrieval effectiveness for a large set of natural language description queries derived from TREC topics on several newswire and web collections.
1390420	Ambiguous queries: test collections need more sense Although there are many papers examining ambiguity in Information Retrieval, this paper shows that there is a whole class of ambiguous word that past research has barely explored. It is shown that the class is more ambiguous than other word types and is commonly used in queries. The lack of test collections containing ambiguous queries is highlighted and a method for creating collections from existing resources is described. Tests using the new collection show the impact of query ambiguity on an IR system: it is shown that conventional systems are incapable of dealing effectively with such queries and that current assumptions about how to improve search effectiveness do not hold when searching on this common query type.
1390421	Automatically identifying localizable queries Personalization of web search results as a technique for improving user satisfaction has received notable attention in the research community over the past decade. Much of this work focuses on modeling and establishing a profile for each user to aid in personalization. Our work takes a more query-centric approach. In this paper, we present a method for efficient, automatic identification of a class of queries we define as localizable from a web search engine query log. We determine a set of relevant features and use conventional machine learning techniques to classify queries. Our experiments find that our technique is able to identify localizable queries with 94% accuracy.
1390423	Real-time automatic tag recommendation Tags are user-generated labels for entities. Existing research on tag recommendation either focuses on improving its accuracy or on automating the process, while ignoring the efficiency issue. We propose a highly-automated novel framework for real-time tag recommendation. The tagged training documents are treated as triplets of (words, docs, tags), and represented in two bipartite graphs, which are partitioned into clusters by Spectral Recursive Embedding (SRE). Tags in each topical cluster are ranked by our novel ranking algorithm. A two-way Poisson Mixture Model (PMM) is proposed to model the document distribution into mixture components within each cluster and aggregate words into word clusters simultaneously. A new document is classified by the mixture model based on its posterior probabilities so that tags are recommended according to their ranks. Experiments on large-scale tagging datasets of scientific documents (CiteULike) and web pages del.icio.us) indicate that our framework is capable of making tag recommendation efficiently and effectively. The average tagging time for testing a document is around 1 second, with over 88% test documents correctly labeled with the top nine tags we suggested.
1390424	Efficient top-k querying over social-tagging networks Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content, as well as for finding and connecting to other users. User-generated content includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. These items can be annotated and rated by different users, and these social tags and derived user-specific scores can be leveraged for searching relevant content and discovering subjectively interesting items. Moreover, the relationships among users can also be taken into consideration for ranking search results, the intuition being that you trust the recommendations of your close friends more than those of your casual acquaintances. Queries for tag or keyword combinations that compute and rank the top-k results thus face a large variety of options that complicate the query processing and pose efficiency challenges. This paper addresses these issues by developing an incremental top-k algorithm with two-dimensional expansions: social expansion considers the strength of relations among users, and semantic expansion considers the relatedness of different tags. It presents a new algorithm, based on principles of threshold algorithms, by folding friends and related tags into the search space in an incremental on-demand manner. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets, crawled from deli.cio.us, Flickr, and LibraryThing.
1390425	Social tag prediction In this paper, we look at the "social tag prediction" problem. Given a set of objects, and a set of tags applied to those objects by users, can we predict whether a given tag could/should be applied to a particular object? We investigated this question using one of the largest crawls of the social bookmarking system del.icio.us gathered to date. For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags. Our results have implications for both the study of tagging systems as potential information retrieval tools, and for the design of such systems.
1390427	Spectral geometry for simultaneously clustering and ranking query search results How best to present query search results is an important problem in search engines and information retrieval systems. When a single query retrieves many results, simply showing them as a long list will provide users with poor overview. Nowadays, ranking and clustering query search results have been two useful separate post-processing techniques to organize retrieved documents. In this paper, we proposed a spectral analysis method based on the content similarity networks to integrate the clustering and ranking techniques for improving literature search. The new approach organizes all these search results into categories intelligently and simultaneously rank the results in each category. A variety of theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that the presented method performs well in real applications, especially in biomedical literature retrieval. Moreover, any free text information can be analyzed with the new method, i.e., the proposed approach can be applied to various information systems, such as Web search engines and literature search service.
1390428	A rank-aggregation approach to searching for optimal query-specific clusters To improve the precision at the very top ranks of a document list presented in response to a query, researchers suggested to exploit information induced from clustering of documents highly ranked by some initial search. We propose a novel model for ranking such ( query-specific ) clusters by the presumed percentage of relevant documents that they contain. The model is based on (i) proposing a palette of "witness" cluster properties that purportedly correlate with this percentage, (ii) devising concrete quantitative measures for these properties, and (iii) ordering the clusters via aggregation of rankings induced by these individual measures. Empirical evaluation shows that our model is consistently more effective than previously suggested methods in detecting clusters containing a high relevant-document percentage. Furthermore, the precision-at-top-ranks performance of this model transcends that of standard document-based retrieval, and competes with that of a state-of-the-art document-based retrieval approach.
1390429	A comparative evaluation of different link types on enhancing document clustering With a growing number of works utilizing link information in enhancing document clustering, it becomes necessary to make a comparative evaluation of the impacts of different link types on document clustering. Various types of links between text documents, including explicit links such as citation links and hyperlinks, implicit links such as co-authorship links, and pseudo links such as content similarity links, convey topic similarity or topic transferring patterns, which is very useful for document clustering. In this study, we adopt a Relaxation Labeling (RL)-based clustering algorithm, which employs both content and linkage information, to evaluate the effectiveness of the aforementioned types of links for document clustering on eight datasets. The experimental results show that linkage is quite effective in improving content-based document clustering. Furthermore, a series of interesting findings regarding the impacts of different link types on document clustering are discovered through our experiments.
1390431	SpotSigs: robust and efficient near duplicate detection in large web collections Motivated by our work with political scientists who need to manually analyze large Web archives of news sites, we present SpotSigs , a new algorithm for extracting and matching signatures for near duplicate detection in large Web crawls. Our spot signatures are designed to favor natural-language portions of Web pages over advertisements and navigational bars. The contributions of SpotSigs are twofold: 1) by combining stopword antecedents with short chains of adjacent content terms, we create robust document signatures with a natural ability to filter out noisy components of Web pages that would otherwise distract pure n-gram-based approaches such as Shingling; 2) we provide an exact and efficient , self-tuning matching algorithm that exploits a novel combination of collection partitioning and inverted index pruning for high-dimensional similarity search. Experiments confirm an increase in combined precision and recall of more than 24 percent over state-of-the-art approaches such as Shingling or I-Match and up to a factor of 3 faster execution times than Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), over a demonstrative "Gold Set" of manually assessed near-duplicate news articles as well as the TREC WT10g Web collection.
1390432	Local text reuse detection Text reuse occurs in many different types of documents and for many different reasons. One form of reuse, duplicate or near-duplicate documents, has been a focus of researchers because of its importance in Web search. Local text reuse occurs when sentences, facts or passages, rather than whole documents, are reused and modified. Detecting this type of reuse can be the basis of new tools for text analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to detecting local text reuse and compare it to other approaches. This comparison involves a study of the amount and type of reuse that occurs in real documents, including TREC newswire and blog collections.
1390433	TSCAN: a novel method for topic summarization and content anatomy A topic is defined as a seminal event or activity along with all directly related events and activities. It is represented as a chronological sequence of documents by different authors published on the Internet. In this paper, we define a task called topic anatomy, which summarizes and associates core parts of a topic graphically so that readers can understand the content easily. The proposed topic anatomy model, called TSCAN, derives the major themes of a topic from the eigenvectors of a temporal block association matrix. Then, the significant events of the themes and their summaries are extracted by examining the constitution of the eigenvectors. Finally, the extracted events are associated through their temporal closeness and context similarity to form the evolution graph of the topic. Experiments based on the official TDT4 corpus demonstrate that the generated evolution graphs comprehensibly describe the storylines of topics. Moreover, in terms of content coverage and consistency, the produced summaries are superior to those of other summarization methods based on human composed reference summaries.
1390435	A new rank correlation coefficient for information retrieval In the field of information retrieval, one is often faced with the problem of computing the correlation between two ranked lists. The most commonly used statistic that quantifies this correlation is Kendall's ?. Often times, in the information retrieval community, discrepancies among those items having high rankings are more important than those among items having low rankings. The Kendall's ? statistic, however, does not make such distinctions and equally penalizes errors both at high and low rankings. In this paper, we propose a new rank correlation coefficient, AP correlation (? ap ), that is based on average precision and has a probabilistic interpretation. We show that the proposed statistic gives more weight to the errors at high rankings and has nice mathematical properties which make it easy to interpret. We further validate the applicability of the statistic using experimental data.
1390436	Learning from labeled features using generalized expectation criteria It is difficult to apply machine learning to new domains because often we lack labeled problem instances. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem that leverages domain knowledge in the form of affinities between input features and classes. For example, in a baseball vs. hockey text classification problem, even without any labeled data, we know that the presence of the word puck is a strong indicator of hockey . We refer to this type of domain knowledge as a labeled feature . In this paper, we propose a method for training discriminative probabilistic models with labeled features and unlabeled instances. Unlike previous approaches that use labeled features to create labeled pseudo-instances, we use labeled features directly to constrain the model's predictions on unlabeled instances. We express these soft constraints using generalized expectation (GE) criteria --- terms in a parameter estimation objective function that express preferences on values of a model expectation. In this paper we train multinomial logistic regression models using GE criteria, but the method we develop is applicable to other discriminative probabilistic models. The complete objective function also includes a Gaussian prior on parameters, which encourages generalization by spreading parameter weight to unlabeled features. Experimental results on text classification data sets show that this method outperforms heuristic approaches to training classifiers with labeled features. Experiments with human annotators show that it is more beneficial to spend limited annotation time labeling features rather than labeling instances. For example, after only one minute of labeling features, we can achieve 80% accuracy on the ibm vs. mac text classification problem using GE-FL, whereas ten minutes labeling documents results in an accuracy of only 77%
1390437	A simple and efficient sampling method for estimating AP and NDCG We consider the problem of large scale retrieval evaluation. Recently two methods based on random sampling were proposed as a solution to the extensive effort required to judge tens of thousands of documents. While the first method proposed by Aslam et al. [1] is quite accurate and efficient, it is overly complex, making it difficult to be used by the community, and while the second method proposed by Yilmaz et al., infAP [14], is relatively simple, it is less efficient than the former since it employs uniform random sampling from the set of complete judgments. Further, none of these methods provide confidence intervals on the estimated values. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) we derive confidence intervals for infAP, (2) we extend infAP to incorporate nonrandom relevance judgments by employing stratified random sampling, hence combining the efficiency of stratification with the simplicity of random sampling, (3) we describe how this approach can be utilized to estimate nDCG from incomplete judgments. We validate the proposed methods using TREC data and demonstrate that these new methods can be used to incorporate nonrandom samples, as were available in TREC Terabyte track '06.
1390438	A general optimization framework for smoothing language models on graph structures Recent work on language models for information retrieval has shown that smoothing language models is crucial for achieving good retrieval performance. Many different effective smoothing methods have been proposed, which mostly implement various heuristics to exploit corpus structures. In this paper, we propose a general and unified optimization framework for smoothing language models on graph structures. This framework not only provides a unified formulation of the existing smoothing heuristics, but also serves as a road map for systematically exploring smoothing methods for language models. We follow this road map and derive several different instantiations of the framework. Some of the instantiations lead to novel smoothing methods. Empirical results show that all such instantiations are effective with some outperforming the state of the art smoothing methods.
1390440	Deep classification in large-scale text hierarchies Most classification algorithms are best at categorizing the Web documents into a few categories, such as the top two levels in the Open Directory Project. Such a classification method does not give very detailed topic-related class information for the user because the first two levels are often too coarse. However, classification on a large-scale hierarchy is known to be intractable for many target categories with cross-link relationships among them. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-classification approach to categorize Web documents into categories in a large-scale taxonomy. The approach consists of two stages: a search stage and a classification stage. In the first stage, a category-search algorithm is used to acquire the category candidates for a given document. Based on the category candidates, we prune the large-scale hierarchy to focus our classification effort on a small subset of the original hierarchy. As a result, the classification model is trained on the small subset before being applied to assign the category for a new document. Since the category candidates are sufficiently close to each other in the hierarchy, a statistical-language-model based classifier using n-gram features is exploited. Furthermore, the structure of the taxonomy can be utilized in this stage to improve the performance of classification. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms on the Open Directory Project with over 130,000 categories. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can reach 51.8% on the measure of Mi-F1 at the 5th level, which is 77.7% improvement over top-down based SVM classification algorithms.
1390441	Topic-bridged PLSA for cross-domain text classification In many Web applications, such as blog classification and new-sgroup classification, labeled data are in short supply. It often happens that obtaining labeled data in a new domain is expensive and time consuming, while there may be plenty of labeled data in a related but different domain. Traditional text classification ap-proaches are not able to cope well with learning across different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain text classification algorithm which extends the traditional probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) algorithm to integrate labeled and unlabeled data, which come from different but related domains, into a unified probabilistic model. We call this new model Topic-bridged PLSA , or TPLSA. By exploiting the common topics between two domains, we transfer knowledge across different domains through a topic-bridge to help the text classification in the target domain. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to maximally mine knowledge that can be transferred between domains, resulting in superior performance when compared to other state-of-the-art text classification approaches. Experimental eval-uation on different kinds of datasets shows that our proposed algorithm can improve the performance of cross-domain text classification significantly.
1390442	trNon-greedy active learning for text categorization using convex ansductive experimental design In this paper we propose a non-greedy active learning method for text categorization using least-squares support vector machines (LSSVM). Our work is based on transductive experimental design (TED), an active learning formulation that effectively explores the information of unlabeled data. Despite its appealing properties, the optimization problem is however NP-hard and thus--like most of other active learning methods--a greedy sequential strategy to select one data example after another was suggested to find a suboptimum. In this paper we formulate the problem into a continuous optimization problem and prove its convexity, meaning that a set of data examples can be selected with a guarantee of global optimum. We also develop an iterative algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem, which turns out to be very easy-to-implement. Our text categorization experiments on two text corpora empirically demonstrated that the new active learning algorithm outperforms the sequential greedy algorithm, and is promising for active text categorization applications.
1390443	Classifiers without borders: incorporating fielded text from neighboring web pages Accurate web page classification often depends crucially on information gained from neighboring pages in the local web graph. Prior work has exploited the class labels of nearby pages to improve performance. In contrast, in this work we utilize a weighted combination of the contents of neighbors to generate a better virtual document for classification. In addition, we break pages into fields, finding that a weighted combination of text from the target and fields of neighboring pages is able to reduce classification error by more than a third. We demonstrate performance on a large dataset of pages from the Open Directory Project and validate the approach using pages from a crawl from the Stanford WebBase. Interestingly, we find no value in anchor text and unexpected value in page titles (and especially titles of parent pages) in the virtual document.
1390445	Evaluation over thousands of queries Information retrieval evaluation has typically been performed over several dozen queries, each judged to near-completeness. There has been a great deal of recent work on evaluation over much smaller judgment sets: how to select the best set of documents to judge and how to estimate evaluation measures when few judgments are available. In light of this, it should be possible to evaluate over many more queries without much more total judging effort. The Million Query Track at TREC 2007 used two document selection algorithms to acquire relevance judgments for more than 1,800 queries. We present results of the track, along with deeper analysis: investigating tradeoffs between the number of queries and number of judgments shows that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments is more cost-effective and as reliable as fewer queries with more judgments. Total assessor effort can be reduced by 95% with no appreciable increase in evaluation errors.
1390446	Novelty and diversity in information retrieval evaluation Evaluation measures act as objective functions to be optimized by information retrieval systems. Such objective functions must accurately reflect user requirements, particularly when tuning IR systems and learning ranking functions. Ambiguity in queries and redundancy in retrieved documents are poorly reflected by current evaluation measures. In this paper, we present a framework for evaluation that systematically rewards novelty and diversity. We develop this framework into a specific evaluation measure, based on cumulative gain. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a test collection based on the TREC question answering track.
1390447	Relevance assessment: are judges exchangeable and does it matter We investigate to what extent people making relevance judgements for a reusable IR test collection are exchangeable. We consider three classes of judge: "gold standard" judges, who are topic originators and are experts in a particular information seeking task; "silver standard" judges, who are task experts but did not create topics; and "bronze standard" judges, who are those who did not define topics and are not experts in the task. Analysis shows low levels of agreement in relevance judgements between these three groups. We report on experiments to determine if this is sufficient to invalidate the use of a test collection for measuring system performance when relevance assessments have been created by silver standard or bronze standard judges. We find that both system scores and system rankings are subject to consistent but small differences across the three assessment sets. It appears that test collections are not completely robust to changes of judge when these judges vary widely in task and topic expertise. Bronze standard judges may not be able to substitute for topic and task experts, due to changes in the relative performance of assessed systems, and gold standard judges are preferred.
1390448	Intuition-supporting visualization of user's performance based on explicit negative higher-order relevance Modeling the beyond-topical aspects of relevance are currently gaining popularity in IR evaluation. For example, the discounted cumulated gain (DCG) measure implicitly models some aspects of higher-order relevance via diminishing the value of relevant documents seen later during retrieval (e.g., due to information cumulated, redundancy, and effort). In this paper, we focus on the concept of negative higher-order relevance (NHOR) made explicit via negative gain values in IR evaluation. We extend the computation of DCG to allow negative gain values, perform an experiment in a laboratory setting, and demonstrate the characteristics of NHOR in evaluation. The approach leads to intuitively reasonable performance curves emphasizing, from the user's point of view, the progression of retrieval towards success or failure. We discuss normalization issues when both positive and negative gain values are allowed and conclude by discussing the usage of NHOR to characterize test collections.
1390450	Relevance judgments between TREC and Non-TREC assessors This paper investigates the agreement of relevance assessments between official TREC judgments and those generated from an interactive IR experiment. Results show that 63% of documents judged relevant by our users matched official TREC judgments. Several factors contributed to differences in the agreements: the number of retrieved relevant documents; the number of relevant documents judged; system effectiveness per topic and the ranking of relevant documents.
1390451	Evaluation measures for preference judgments There has been recent interest in collecting user or assessor preferences, rather than absolute judgments of relevance, for the evaluation or learning of ranking algorithms. Since measures like precision, recall, and DCG are defined over absolute judgments, evaluation over preferences will require new evaluation measures that explicitly model them. We describe a class of such measures and compare absolute and preference measures over a large TREC collection.
1390452	Exploring evaluation metrics: GMAP versus MAP In retrieval experiments, an effectiveness metrics is used to generate a score for each system-topic pair being tested. It is then usual to average the system-topic scores to obtain a system score, which is used for the purpose of system comparison. In this paper we explore the ramifications of using the geometric mean (GMAP), rather than the arithmetic mean (MAP) when computing an aggregate system score from a set of system-topic scores. We find that GMAP does indeed handle variability in topic difficulty more consistently than does the usual MAP aggregation method.
1390453	A new interpretation of average precision We consider the question of whether Average Precision, as a measure of retrieval effectiveness, can be regarded as deriving from a model of user searching behaviour. It turns out that indeed it can be so regarded, under a very simple stochastic model of user behaviour.
1390454	Comparing metrics across TREC and NTCIR:: the robustness to pool depth bias An abstract is not available.
1390455	Relevance thresholds in system evaluations We introduce and explore the concept of an individual's relevance threshold as a way of reconciling differences in outcomes between batch and user experiments.
1390456	Precision-at-ten considered redundant Information retrieval systems are compared using evaluation metrics, with researchers commonly reporting results for simple metrics such as precision-at-10 or reciprocal rank together with more complex ones such as average precision or discounted cumulative gain. In this paper, we demonstrate that complex metrics are as good as or better than simple metrics at predicting the performance of the simple metrics on other topics. Therefore, reporting of results from simple metrics alongside complex ones is redundant.
1390457	Structuring collections with Scatter/Gather extensions A major component of sense-making is organizing--grouping, labeling, and summarizing--the data at hand in order to form a useful mental model, a necessary precursor to identifying missing information and to reasoning about the data. Previous work has shown the Scatter/Gather model to be useful in exploratory activities that occur when users encounter unknown document collections. However, the topic structure communicated by Scatter/Gather is closely tied to the behavior of the underlying clustering algorithm; this structure may not reflect the mental model most applicable to the information need. In this paper we describe the initial design of a mixed-initiative information structuring tool that leverages aspects of the well-studied Scatter/Gather model but permits the user to impose their own desired structure when necessary.
1390458	Text collections for FIRE The aim of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) is to create a Cranfield-like evaluation framework in the spirit of TREC, CLEF and NTCIR, for Indian Language Information Retrieval. For the first year, six Indian languages have been selected: Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu. This poster describes the tasks as well as the document and topic collections that are to be used at the FIRE workshop.
1390459	A longitudinal study of real-time search assistance adoption We present findings from a log based study designed to track the adoption of features of a new real-time query refinement interface deployed on the Yahoo search engine. Several trends from the first four months are noted and discussed.
1390460	TopicRank: bringing insight to users An abstract is not available.
1390461	Talking the talk vs. walking the walk: salience of information needs in querying vs. browsing Traditional information retrieval models assume that users express their information needs via text queries ( i.e. , their "talk"). In this poster, we consider Web browsing behavior outside of interactions with retrieval systems ( i.e. , users' "walk") as an alternative source of signal describing users' information needs, and compare it to the query-expressed information needs on a large dataset. Our findings demonstrate that information needs expressed in different behavior modalities are largely non-overlapping, and that past behavior in each modality is the most accurate predictor of future behavior in that modality. Results also show that browsing data provides a stronger source of signal than search queries due to its greater volume, which explains previous work that has found implicit behavioral data to be a valuable source of information for user modeling and personalization.
1390462	Exploring mouse movements for inferring query intent Clickthrough on search results have been successfully used to infer user interest and preferences, but are often noisy and potentially ambiguous. We explore the potential of a complementary, more sensitive signal -mouse movements- in providing insights into the intent behind a web search query. We report preliminary results of studying user mouse movements on search result pages, with the goal of inferring user intent - in particular, to explore whether we can automatically distinguish the different query classes such as navigational vs. informational. Our preliminary exploration confirms the value of studying mouse movements for user intent inference, and suggests interesting avenues for future exploration.
1390463	Emulating query-biased summaries using document titles Generating query-biased summaries can take up a large part of the response time of interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems. This paper proposes to use document titles as an alternative to queries in the generation of summaries. The use of document titles allows us to pre-generate summaries statically, and thus, improve the response speed of IIR systems. Our experiments suggest that title-biased summaries are a promising alternative to query-biased summaries.
1390464	Hierarchical naive bayes models for representing user profiles In this paper, we show how a user profile can be enhanced when a more detailed description of the products is included. Two main assumptions have been considered: the first implies that the set of features used to describe an item can be organized into a well-defined set of components or categories, and the second is that the user's rating for a given item is obtained by combining user opinions of the relevance of each component.
1390465	A topical PageRank based algorithm for recommender systems In this paper, we propose a Topical PageRank based algorithm for recommender systems, which aim to rank products by analyzing previous user-item relationships, and recommend top-rank items to potentially interested users. We evaluate our algorithm on MovieLens dataset and empirical experiments demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art recommending algorithms.
1390466	The impact of history length on personalized search Personalized search is a promising way to better serve different users' information needs. Search history is one of the major information sources for search personalization. We investigated the impact of history length on the effectiveness of personalized ranking. We carried out task-based user study for Web search, and obtained ranked relevance judgments for all queries. Query contexts derived from previous queries in the same task are used to re-rank results for the current query. Experimental results show that the performance of personalization generally improves as more queries are accumulated, but most of the benefits come from a few immediately preceding queries.
1390467	User preference choices for complex question answering Question answering systems increasingly need to deal with complex information needs that require more than simple factoid answers. The evaluation of such systems is usually carried out using precision- or recall-based system performance metrics. Previous work has demonstrated that when users are shown two search result lists side-by-side, they can reliably differentiate between the qualities of the lists. We investigate the consistency between this user-based approach and system-oriented metrics in the question answering environment. Our initial results indicate that the two methodologies show a high level of disagreement.
1390468	Towards personalized distributed information retrieval Our aim is to investigate if and how the performance of Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems can be improved through personalization. Toward this aim we are building a testbed of document collections and corresponding personalized relevance judgments. In this paper we discuss our intended approach for personalizing the three different phases of the DIR process. We also describe the test collection we are building and discuss our methodology for evaluating personalized DIR using relevance information taken from social bookmarking data.
1390469	Task-aware search personalization Search personalization has been pursued in many ways, in order to provide better result rankings and better overall search experience to individual users [5]. However, blindly applying personalization to all user queries, for example, by a background model derived from the user's long-term query-and-click history, is not always appropriate for aiding the user in accomplishing her actual task. User interests change over time, a user sometimes works on very different categories of tasks within a short timespan, and history-based personalization may impede a user's desire of discovering new topics. In this paper we propose a personalization framework that is selective in a twofold sense. First, it selectively employs personalization techniques for queries that are expected to benefit from prior history information, while refraining from undue actions otherwise. Second, we introduce the notion of tasks representing different granularity levels of a user profile, ranging from very specific search goals to broad topics, and base our reasoning selectively on query-relevant user tasks. These considerations are cast into a statistical language model for tasks, queries, and documents, supporting both judicious query expansion and result re-ranking. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by an empirical user study.
1390471	Personal vs non-personal blogs: initial classification experiments We address the task of separating personal from non-personal blogs, and report on a set of baseline experiments where we compare the performance on a small set of features across a set of five classifiers. We show that with a limited set of features a performance of up to 90% can be obtained.
1390472	Exploiting subjectivity analysis in blogs to improve political leaning categorization In this paper, we address a relatively new and interesting text categorization problem: classify a political blog as either liberal or conservative , based on its political leaning. Our subjectivity analysis based method is twofold: 1) we identify subjective sentences that contain at least two strong subjective clues based on the General Inquirer dictionary; 2) from subjective sentences identified, we extract opinion expressions and other features to build political leaning classifiers. Experimental results with a political blog corpus we built show that by using features from subjective sentences can significantly improve the classification performance. In addition, by extracting opinion expressions from subjective sentences, we are able to reveal opinions that are characteristic of a specific political leaning to some extent.
1390473	Ranking opinionated blog posts using OpinionFinder The aim of an opinion finding system is not just to retrieve relevant documents, but to also retrieve documents that express an opinion towards the query target entity. In this work, we propose a way to use and integrate an opinion-identification toolkit, OpinionFinder, into the retrieval process of an Information Retrieval (IR) system, such that opinionated, relevant documents are retrieved in response to a query. In our experiments, we vary the number of top-ranked documents that must be parsed in response to a query, and investigate the effect on opinion retrieval performance and required parsing time. We find that opinion finding retrieval performance is improved by integrating OpinionFinder into the retrieval system, and that retrieval performance grows as more posts are parsed by OpinionFinder. However, the benefit eventually tails off at a deep rank, suggesting that an optimal setting for the system has been achieved.
1390474	Searching blogs and news: a study on popular queries Blog/news search engines are very important channels to reach information about the real-time happenings. In this paper, we study the popular queries collected over one year period and compare their search results returned by a blog search engine (i.e., Technorati) and a news search engine (i.e., Google News). We observed that the numbers of hits returned by the two search engines for the same set of queries were highly correlated, suggesting that blogs often provide commentary to current events reported in news. As many popular queries are related to some events, we further observed a high cohesiveness among the returned search results for these queries.
1390475	Aggregated click-through data in a homogeneous user community There are many proposed methods for using clickthrough data for common queries to improve the quality of search results returned for that query. In this study we examine the search behaviour of users in a close-knit community on such queries. We argue that the benefit of using aggregated clickthrough data varies from task to task: it may improve document rankings for navigational or specific informational queries, but is less likely to be of value to users issuing a broad informational query.
1390476	To tag or not to tag -: harvesting adjacent metadata in large-scale tagging systems We present HAMLET, a suite of principles, scoring models and algorithms to automatically propagate metadata along edges in a document neighborhood. As a showcase scenario we consider tag prediction in community-based Web 2.0 tagging applications. Experiments using real-world data demonstrate the viability of our approach in large-scale environments where tags are scarce. To the best of our knowledge, HAMLET is the first system to promote an efficient and precise reuse of shared metadata in highly dynamic, large-scale Web 2.0 tagging systems.
1390477	Exploring question subjectivity prediction in community QA In this paper we begin to investigate how to automatically determine the subjectivity orientation of questions posted by real users in community question answering (CQA) portals. Subjective questions seek answers containing private states, such as personal opinion and experience. In contrast, objective questions request objective, verifiable information, often with support from reliable sources. Knowing the question orientation would be helpful not only for evaluating answers provided by users, but also for guiding the CQA engine to process questions more intelligently. Our experiments on Yahoo! Answers data show that our method exhibits promising performance.
1390478	On the evolution of the yahoo! answers QA community While question answering communities have been gaining popularity for several years, we wonder if the increased popularity actually improves or degrades the user experience. In addition, automatic QA systems, which utilize different sources such as search engines and social media, are emerging rapidly. QA communities have already created abundant resources of millions of questions and hundreds of millions of answers. The question whether they will continue to serve as an effective source is of information for web search and question answering is of vital importance. In this poster, we investigate the temporal evolution of a popular QA community - Yahoo! Answers, with respect to its effectiveness in answering three basic types of questions: factoid, opinion and complex questions. Our experiments show that Yahoo! Answers keeps growing rapidly, while its overall quality as an information source for factoid question-answering degrades. However, instead of answering factoid questions, it might be more effective to answer opinion and complex questions.
1390479	Detecting synonyms in social tagging systems to improve content retrieval Collaborative tagging used in online social content systems is naturally characterized by many synonyms, causing low precision retrieval. We propose a mechanism based on user preference profiles to identify synonyms that can be used to retrieve more relevant documents by expanding the user's query. Using a popular online book catalog we discuss the effectiveness of our method over usual similarity based expansion methods.
1390480	SOPING: a Chinese customer review mining system With the booming development of the Web, popular Chinese forums enable people to find experienced customers' reviews for products. In order to get an all-around opinion about one product, users need to go through plenty of web pages, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Consequently, automatic review mining and summarization has become a hot research topic recently. However, previous approaches are not applicable for mining Chinese customer reviews. In this paper, we introduce SOPING, a Chinese customer review mining system that mines reviews from forums. Specifically, we propose a novel search-based approach to extract product features and a feature-oriented sentence orientation determination method. Our experimental results show that our proposed techniques are highly effective.
1390481	Combining learn-based and lexicon-based techniques for sentiment detection without using labeled examples In this work, we propose a novel scheme for sentiment classification (without labeled examples) which combines the strengths of both "learn-based" and "lexicon-based" approaches as follows: we first use a lexicon-based technique to label a portion of informative examples from given task (or domain); then learn a new supervised classifier based on these labeled ones; finally apply this classifier to the task. The experimental results indicate that proposed scheme could dramatically outperform "learn-based" and "lexicon-based" techniques.
1390482	Semi-supervised spam filtering: does it work? The results of the 2006 ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge suggest that semi-supervised learning methods work well for spam filtering when the source of available labeled examples differs from those to be classified. We have attempted to reproduce these results using data from the 2005 and 2007 TREC Spam Track, and have found the opposite effect: methods like self-training and transductive support vector machines yield inferior classifiers to those constructed using supervised learning on the labeled data alone. We investigate differences between the ECML/PKDD and TREC data sets and methodologies that may account for the opposite results.
1390483	Limits of opinion-finding baseline systems In opinion-finding, the retrieval system is tasked with retrieving not just relevant documents, but which also express an opinion towards the query target entity. Most opinion-finding systems are based on a two-stage approach, where initially the system aims to retrieve relevant documents, which are then re-ranked according to the extent to which they are detected to be of an opinionated nature. In this work, we investigate how the underlying 'baseline' retrieval system performance affects the overall opinion-finding performance. We apply two effective opinion-finding techniques to all the baseline runs submitted to the TREC 2007 Blog track, and draw new insights and conclusions.
1390484	Web query translation via web log mining This paper describes a method to automatically acquire query translation pairs by mining web click-through data. The extraction requires no crawling or Chinese words segmentation, and can capture popular translations. Experimental results on a real click-through data show that only 17.4% of the extracted queries are in the dictionary, and our method can achieve 62.2% (in top-1) to 80.0% (in top-5) precision in translating web queries. Moreover, the extracted translations are semantically relevant to the source query, which is particularly useful for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR).
1390485	Analyzing web text association to disambiguate abbreviation in queries We introduce a statistical model for abbreviation disambiguation in Web search, based on analysis of Web data resources, including anchor text, click log and query log. By combining evidence from multiple sources, we are able to accurately disambiguate the abbreviation in queries. Experiments on real Web search queries show promising results.
1390486	Bloggers as experts: feed distillation using expert retrieval models We address the task of (blog) feed distillation: to find blogs that are principally devoted to a given topic. The task may be viewed as an association finding task, between topics and bloggers. Under this view, it resembles the expert finding task, for which a range of models have been proposed. We adopt two language modeling-based approaches to expert finding, and determine their effectiveness as feed distillation strategies. The two models capture the idea that a human will often search for key blogs by spotting highly relevant posts (the Posting model) or by taking global aspects of the blog into account (the Blogger model). Results show the Blogger model outperforms the Posting model and delivers state-of-the art performance, out-of-the-box.
1390487	Search effectiveness with a breadth-first crawl Previous scalability experiments found that early precision improves as collection size increases. However, that was under the assumption that a collection's documents are all sampled with uniform probability from the same population. We contrast this to a large breadth-first web crawl, an important scenario in real-world Web search, where the early documents have quite different characteristics from the later documents.
1390488	Guide focused crawler efficiently and effectively using on-line topical importance estimation Focused crawling is a critical technique for topical resource discovery on the Web. We propose a new frontier prioritizing algorithm, namely, the OTIE (On-line Topical Importance Estimation) algorithm, which efficiently and effectively combines link-based and content-based analysis to evaluate the priority of an uncrawled URL in the frontier. We then demonstrate OTIE's advantages over traditional prioritizing algorithms by real crawling experiments.
1390489	Web page retrieval in ubiquitous sensor environments This paper proposes new concept of query free web search for daily living. We ordinarily benefit from additional information about our daily activities that we are currently engaged in. When washing a coffee maker, for example, we receive the benefit if we obtain such information as 'cleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes its stain well.' Our proposed method automatically searches for a web page including such information relates to an activity of daily living when the activity is performed. We assume that wireless sensor nodes are attached to daily objects to detect object use; our method makes a query from the names of objects which are used. Then, the method retrieves a web page relates to the activity of daily living by using the query.
1390490	Automatic document prior feature selection for web retrieval Document prior features, such as Pagerank and URL depth, can improve the retrieval effectiveness of Web Information Retrieval (IR) systems. However, not all queries equally benefit from the application of a document prior feature. This paper aims to investigate whether the retrieval performance can be further enhanced by selecting the best document prior feature on a per-query basis. We present a novel method for selecting the best document prior feature on a per-query basis. We evaluate our technique on the TREC .GOV Web test collection and its associated TREC 2003 Web search tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed selection method.
1390491	Using parsimonious language models on web data In this paper we explore the use of parsimonious language models for web retrieval. These models are smaller thus more efficient than the standard language models and are therefore well suited for large-scale web retrieval. We have conducted experiments on four TREC topic sets, and found that the parsimonious language model results in improvement of retrieval effectiveness over the standard language model for all data-sets and measures. In all cases the improvement is significant, and more substantial than in earlier experiments on newspaper/newswire data.
1390492	Query preprocessing: improving web search through a Vietnamese word tokenization approach In this poster paper, we propose a novel approach to improve web search relevancy by tokenizing a Vietnamese query text prior submitting it to a search engine. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness and practical value.
1390494	AdImage: video advertising by image matching and ad scheduling optimization With the prevalence of recording devices and the ease of media sharing, consumers are embracing huge amounts of Internet videos. There arise the needs for effective video advertisement systems following their phenomenal success in text. We propose a novel advertising system, AdImage , which automatically associates relevant ads by matching characteristic images, referred to as adImages (analogous to adWords) here. The proposed image matching method is invariant to certain distortions commonly observed in shared videos. AdImage also avoids the pitfalls of poor tagging qualities in shared videos and provides a brand-new venue to specify ad targets by image objects. Moreover, we formulate the image matching scores and the parameterized bidding information as a nonlinear optimization problem for maximizing the system revenues and user perception.
1390495	Bag-of-visual-words expansion using visual relatedness for video indexing Bag-of-visual-words (BoW) has been popular for visual classification in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel BoW expansion method to alleviate the effect of visual word correlation problem. We achieve this by diffusing the weights of visual words in BoW based on visual word relatedness, which is rigorously defined within a visual ontology. The proposed method is tested in video indexing experiment on TRECVID-2006 video retrieval benchmark, and an improvement of 7% over the traditional BoW is reported.
1390496	A word shape coding method for camera-based document images This paper reports a word shape coding method to facilitate retrieval of camera-based document images without OCR. Due to perspective distortion, many reported word shape coding methods fail on camera-based images. In this paper, the problem is addressed by approximating the perspective transformation with an affine transformation, and employing an affine invariant, namely length ratio, to represent the connected components. Components in a document image are classified into a few clusters, each of which is assigned with a representative symbol. Retrieval are based on "words" comprising of symbols. The experiment results showed that the proposed method achieved an average retrieval precision of 93.43% and recall of 94.22%.
1390497	Term clouds as surrogates for user generated speech User generated spoken audio remains a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology and content-based audio surrogates derived from ASR-transcripts must be error robust. An investigation of the use of term clouds as surrogates for podcasts demonstrates that ASR term clouds closely approximate term clouds derived from human-generated transcripts across a range of cloud sizes. A user study confirms the conclusion that ASR-clouds are viable surrogates for depicting the content of podcasts.
1390498	A faceted interface for multimedia search With the rapid increase in online video services, video retrieval systems are becoming increasingly important search tools to many users in many different fields. In this poster we present a novel video retrieval interface, which supports the creation of multiple search "facets", to aid users carrying out complex, multi-faceted search tasks. The interface allows multiple searches to be executed and viewed simultaneously, and allows material to be reorganized between the facets. An experiment is presented which compares the faceted interface to a tabbed interface similar to that on modern web browsers, and some preliminary results are given.
1390499	WISA: a novel web image semantic analysis system We present a novel Web Image Semantic Analysis (WISA) system, which explores the problem of adaptively modeling the distributions of the semantic labels of the web image on its surrounding text. To deal with this problem, we employ a new piecewise penalty weighted regression model to learn the weights of the contributions of the different parts of the surrounding text to the semantic labels of images. Experimental results on a real web image data set show that it can improve the performance of web image semantic annotation significantly.
1390500	One-button search extracts wider interests: an empirical study with video bookmarking search This poster presents an overview of the characteristics of a one-button information retrieval interface with closed captions from TV watching activities, which is intended to lighten the burden of remembering and entering query terms while watching TV. We investigated this interface with an experimental system named Video Bookmarking Search , which estimates query terms from closed captions with named-entity recognition and sentence labeling techniques. According to an empirical evaluation for 1,138 search queries from 206 bookmarks using seven actual TV shows on city life, travel, health, and cuisine, we found wider queries and search results are acceptable through the query-input-free interface, despite the fact that the number of queries and search results that are directly relevant to the users' original intentions is not high. The main reason is a watching user's interest is wider than what is expressed with query terms.
1390501	Product retrieval for grocery stores We introduce a grocery retrieval system that maps shopping lists written in natural language into actual products in a grocery store. We have developed the system using nine months of shopping basket data from a large Finnish supermarket. To evaluate the system, we used 70 real shopping lists gathered from customers of the supermarket. Our system achieves over 80% precision for products at rank one, and the precision is around 70% for products at rank 5.
1390502	A reranking model for genomics aspect search In this paper, we propose a reranking model to improve the aspect-level performance in the biomedical domain. This model iteratively computes the maximum hidden aspect for every retrieved passage and then reranks these passages from aspect subsets. The experimental results show the improvements of the aspect-level performance up to 27.14% for 2006 Genomics topics and 27.09% for 2007 Genomics topics.
1390503	Improving biomedical document retrieval using domain knowledge Research articles typically introduce new results or findings and relate them to knowledge entities of immediate relevance. However, a large body of context knowledge related to the results is often not explicitly mentioned in the article. To overcome this limitation the state-of-the-art information retrieval approaches rely on the latent semantic analysis in which terms in articles are projected to a lower dimensional latent space and best possible matches in this space are identified. However, this approach may not perform well enough if the number of explicit knowledge entities in the articles is too small compared to the amount of knowledge in the domain. We address the problem by exploiting a domain knowledge layer, a rich network of relations among knowledge entities in the domain extracted from a large corpus of documents. The knowledge layer supplies the context knowledge that lets us relate different knowledge entities and hence improve the information retrieval performance. We develop and study a new framework for i) learning and aggregating the relations in the knowledge layer from the literature corpus; ii) and for exploiting these relations to improve the information-retrieval of relevant documents.
1390504	Kleio: a knowledge-enriched information retrieval system for biology Kleio is an advanced information retrieval (IR) system developed at the UK National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM) 1 . The system offers textual and metadata searches across MEDLINE and provides enhanced searching functionality by leveraging terminology management technologies.
1390505	Enhancing keyword-based botanical information retrieval with information extraction Keyword-based retrieval matches search terms and documents via term co-occurrence. Such an approach does not allow matching based on the specific plant characteristic descriptions that are often used in botanical text retrieval. This study applies information extraction techniques to automatically extract plant characteristic information from text and allows users to search using such information in combination with keywords. An evaluation experiment was conducted using actual users. The results indicate that this approach enhances task-based retrieval performance.
1390506	How medical expertise influences web search interaction Domain expertise can have an important influence on how people search. In this poster we present findings from a log-based study into how medical domain experts search the Web for information related to their expertise, as compared with non-experts. We find differences in sites visited, query vocabulary, and search behavior. The findings have implications for the automatic identification of domain experts from interaction logs, and the use of domain knowledge in applications such as query suggestion or page recommendation to support non-experts.
1390507	Generating diverse katakana variants based on phonemic mapping In Japanese, it is quite common for the same word to be written in several different ways. This is especially true for katakana words which are typically used for transliterating foreign languages. This ambiguity becomes critical for automatic processing such as information retrieval (IR). To tackle this problem, we propose a simple but effective approach to generating katakana variants by considering phonemic representation of the original language for a given word. The proposed approach is evaluated through an assessment of the variants it generates. Also, the impact of the generated variants on IR is studied in comparison to an existing approach using katakana rewriting rules.
1390508	Exploiting sequential dependencies for expert finding We propose an expert finding method based on assumption of sequential dependence between a candidate expert and the query terms in the scope of a document. We assume that the strength of relation of a candidate to the document's content depends on its position in this document with respect to the positions of the query terms. The experiments on the official Enterprise TREC data demonstrate the advantage of our method over the method based on independence of query terms and persons in a document.
1390509	Modeling expert finding as an absorbing random walk We introduce a novel approach to expert finding based on multi-step relevance propagation from documents to related candidates. Relevance propagation is modeled with an absorbing random walk. The evaluation on the two official Enterprise TREC data sets demonstrates the advantage of our method over the state-of-the-art method based on one-step propagation.
1390510	A scalable assistant librarian: hierarchical subject classification of books In this paper, we discuss our work in progress towards a scalable hierarchical classification system for books using the Library of Congress subject hierarchy. We examine the characteristics of this domain which make the problem very challenging, and we look at several appropriate performance measurements. We show that both Hieron and Hierarchical Support Vector Machines perform moderately well.
1390511	Information retrieval on bug locations by learning co-located bug report clusters Bug locating usually involves intensive search activities and incurs unpredictable cost of labor and time. An issue of information retrieval on bug locations is particularly addressed to facilitate identifying bugs from software code. In this paper, a novel bug retrieval approach with co-location shrinkage (CS) is proposed. The proposed approach has been implemented in open-source software projects collected from real-world repositories, and consistently improves the retrieval accuracy of a state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
1390512	Summarization of compressed text images: an experience on Indic script documents Automatic summarization of JBIG2 coded textual images is discussed. Compressed images are partially decompressed to compute relevant features. The feature extraction method is free from using any character recognition module. Summary sentences are ranked. Experiment considers documents in Indic scripts that lack in having any efficient OCR systems. Script independent aspect of the approach is highlighted through use of two most popular Indic scripts. Sentence selection efficiency of about 61% is achieved when judged against man-made summarization. A nonparametric (distribution-free) rank statistic shows a correlation coefficient of 0.33 as a measure of the (minimum) strength of the associations between sentence ranking by machine and human.
1390514	A method for transferring retrieval scores between collections with non-overlapping vocabularies We present a method for projecting retrieval scores across two corpora with a shared, parallel corpus.
1390515	Improving relevance feedback in language modeling with score regularization We demonstrate that regularization can improve feedback in a language modeling framework.
1390516	Theoretical bounds on and empirical robustness of score regularization to different similarity measures We present theoretical bounds and empirical robustness of score regularization given changes in the similarity measure.
1390517	A study of query length We analyse query length, and fit power-law and Poisson distributions to four different query sets. We provide a practical model for query length, based on the truncation of a Poisson distribution for short queries and a power-law distribution for longer queries, that better fits real query length distributions than earlier proposals.
1390518	Don't have a stemmer?: be un+concern+ed The choice of indexing terms used to represent documents crucially determines how e ective subsequent retrieval will be. IR systems commonly use rule-based stemmers to normalize surface word forms to combat the problem of not finding documents that contain words related to query terms by inflectional or derivational morphology. But such stemmers are not available in all languages. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of unsupervised morphological segmentation as an alternative to stemming using test sets in thirteen European languages. We find that unsupervised segmentation is significantly better than unnormalized words, in several cases by more than 20%. However, rule-based stemming, if available, is better in low complexity languages. We also compare these methods to the use of character n-grams, finding that on average n-grams yield the best performance.
1390519	Parsimonious concept modeling An abstract is not available.
1390520	Parsimonious relevance models We describe a method for applying parsimonious language models to re-estimate the term probabilities assigned by relevance models. We apply our method to six topic sets from test collections in five different genres. Our parsimonious relevance models (i) improve retrieval effectiveness in terms of MAP on all collections, (ii) significantly outperform their non-parsimonious counterparts on most measures, and (iii) have a precision enhancing effect, unlike other blind relevance feedback methods.
1390521	Author-topic evolution analysis using three-way non-negative Paratucker Analyzing three-way data has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the intrinsic rich structures in real-world datasets. The PARATUCKER model has been proposed to combine the axis capabilities of the Parafac model and the structural generality of the Tucker model. However, no algorithms have been developed for fitting the PARATUCKER model. In this paper, we propose TANPT algorithm to solve the PARATUCKER model. We apply the algorithm for temporal relation co-clustering on author-topic evolution. Experiments on DBLP datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.
1390522	Exploiting proximity feature in bigram language model for information retrieval Language modeling approaches have been effectively dealing with the dependency among query terms based on N-gram such as bigram or trigram models. However, bigram language models suffer from adjacency-sparseness problem which means that dependent terms are not always adjacent in documents, but can be far from each other, sometimes with distance of a few sentences in a document. To resolve the adjacency-sparseness problem, this paper proposes a new type of bigram language model by explicitly incorporating the proximity feature between two adjacent terms in a query. Experimental results on three test collections show that the proposed bigram language model significantly improves previous bigram model as well as Tao's approach, the state-of-art method for proximity-based method.
1390523	Measuring concept relatedness using language models Over the years, the notion of concept relatedness has attracted considerable attention. A variety of approaches, based on ontology structure, information content, association, or context have been proposed to indicate the relatedness of abstract ideas. We propose a method based on the cross entropy reduction between language models of concepts which are estimated based on document-concept assignments. The approach shows improved or competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on two test sets in the biomedical domain.
1390524	Query-drift prevention for robust query expansion Pseudo-feedback-based automatic query expansion yields effective retrieval performance on average, but results in performance inferior to that of using the original query for many information needs. We address an important cause of this robustness issue, namely, the query drift problem , by fusing the results retrieved in response to the original query and to its expanded form. Our approach posts performance that is significantly better than that of retrieval based only on the original query and more robust than that of retrieval using the expanded query.
1390525	Adaptive label-driven scaling for latent semantic indexing This paper targets on enhancing Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by exploiting category labels. Specifically, in the term-document matrix, the vector for each term either appearing in labels or semantically close to labels is scaled before performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to boost its impact on the generated left singular vectors. As a result, the similarities among documents in the same category are increased. Furthermore, an adaptive scaling strategy is designed to better utilize the hierarchical structure of categories. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to significantly improve the performance of hierarchical text categorization.
1390526	Fixed-threshold SMO for Joint Constraint Learning Algorithm of Structural SVM In this paper, we describe a fixed-threshold sequential minimal optimization (FSMO) for a joint constraint learning algorithm of structural classification SVM problems. Because FSMO uses the fact that the joint constraint formulation of structural SVM has b =0, FSMO breaks down the quadratic programming (QP) problems of structural SVM into a series of smallest QP problems, each involving only one variable. By using only one variable, FSMO is advantageous in that each QP sub-problem does not need subset selection.
1390527	Posterior probabilistic clustering using NMF We introduce the posterior probabilistic clustering (PPC), which provides a rigorous posterior probability interpretation for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and removes the uncertainty in clustering assignment. Furthermore, PPC is closely related to probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI).
1390528	On document splitting in passage detection Passages can be hidden within a text to circumvent their disallowed transfer. Such release of compartmentalized information is of concern to all corporate and governmental organization. We explore the methodology to detect such hidden passages within a document. A document is divided into passages using various document splitting techniques, and a text classifier is used to categorize such passages. We present a novel document splitting technique called dynamic windowing, which significantly improves precision, recall and F1 measure.
1390529	Learning with support vector machines for query-by-multiple-examples We explore an alternative Information Retrieval paradigm called Query-By-Multiple-Examples (QBME) where the information need is described not by a set of terms but by a set of documents. Intuitive ideas for QBME include using the centroid of these documents or the well-known Rocchio algorithm to construct the query vector. We consider this problem from the perspective of text classification , and find that a better query vector can be obtained through learning with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For online queries, we show how SVMs can be learned from one-class examples in linear time. For offline queries, we show how SVMs can be learned from positive and unlabeled examples together in linear or polynomial time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches have been confirmed by our experiments on four real-world datasets.
1390530	Question classification with semantic tree kernel Question Classification plays an important role in most Question Answering systems. In this paper, we exploit semantic features in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Question Classification. We propose a semantic tree kernel to incorporate semantic similarity information. A diverse set of semantic features is evaluated. Experimental results show that SVMs with semantic features, especially semantic classes, can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art systems.
1390531	Generalising multiple capture-recapture to non-uniform sample sizes Algorithms in distributed information retrieval often rely on accurate knowledge of the size of a collection. The "multiple capture-recapture" method of Shokouhi et al. is one of the more reliable algorithms for determining collection size, but it relies on samples with a uniform number of documents. Such uniform samples are often hard to obtain in a working system. A simple generalisation of multiple capture-recapture does not rely on uniform sample sizes. Simulations show it is as accurate as the original method even when sample sizes vary considerably, making it a useful technique in real tools.
1390532	Predicting when browsing context is relevant to search We investigate a representative case of sudden information need change of Web users. By analyzing search engine query logs, we show that the majority of queries submitted by users after browsing documents in the news domain are related to the most recently browsed document. We investigate ways of identifying whether a query is a good candidate for contextualization conditioned on the most recently browsed document by a user. We build a successful classifier for this task, which achieves 96% precision at 90% recall.
1390534	XML-aided phrase indexing for hypertext documents We combine techniques of XML Mining and Text Mining for the benefit of Information Retrieval. By manipulating the word sequence according to the XML structure of the marked-up text, we strengthen phrase boundaries so that they are more obvious to the algorithms that extract multiword sequences from text. Consequently, the quality of the indexed phrases improves, which has a positive effect on the average precision measured by the INEX 2007 standards.
1390535	Proximity-aware scoring for XML retrieval Proximity-aware scoring functions lead to significant effectiveness improvements for text retrieval. For XML IR, we can sometimes enhance the retrieval quality by exploiting knowledge about the document structure combined with established text IR methods. This paper introduces modified proximity scores that take the document structure into account and demonstrates the effect for the INEX benchmark.
1390536	Locating relevant text within XML documents Traditional document retrieval has shown to be a competitive approach in XML element retrieval, which is counter-intuitive since the element retrieval task requests all and only relevant document parts to be retrieved. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of document and element retrieval, highlights the relative strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, and explains the relative effectiveness of document retrieval approaches at element retrieval tasks.
1390537	A flexible extension of XPath to improve XML querying This work presents a flexible XML selection language, FleXPath which allows the formulation of flexible constraints on both structure and content of XML documents. Some experimental results, obtained with a preliminary prototype, are described in order to show that the idea promises good results.
1390538	Combining document- and paragraph-based entity ranking We study entity ranking on the INEX entity track and propose a simple graph-based ranking approach that enables to combine scores on document and paragraph level. The combined approach improves the retrieval results not only on the INEX testset, but similarly on TREC's expert finding task.
1390539	Re-ranking search results using document-passage graphs We present a novel passage -based approach to re-ranking documents in an initially retrieved list so as to improve precision at top ranks. While most work on passage-based document retrieval ranks a document based on the query similarity of its constituent passages, our approach leverages information about the centrality of the document passages with respect to the initial document list. Passage centrality is induced over a bipartite document-passage graph, wherein edge weights represent document-passage similarities. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach yields effective re-ranking performance. Furthermore, the performance is superior to that of previously proposed passage-based document ranking methods.
1390540	Utilizing phrase based semantic information for term dependency Previous work on term dependency has not taken into account semantic information underlying query phrases. In this work, we study the impact of utilizing phrase based concepts for term dependency. We use Wikipedia to separate important and less important term dependencies, and treat them accordingly as features in a linear feature-based retrieval model. We compare our method with a Markov Random Field (MRF) model on four TREC document collections. Our experimental results show that utilizing phrase based concepts improves the retrieval effectiveness of term dependency, and reduces the size of the feature set to large extent.
1390541	Inferring the most important types of a query: a semantic approach In this paper we present a technique for ranking the most important types or categories for a given query. Rather than trying to find the category of the query, known as query categorization, our approach seeks to find the most important types related to the query results. Not necessarily the query category falls into this ranking of types and therefore our approach can be complementary.
1390542	On multiword entity ranking in peer-to-peer search Previously [2], we postulated the advantage of using entity extraction to implement a new Peer-to-Peer (P2P) search framework for reducing network traffic and providing a trade off between precision and recall. We now propose an entity ranking method designed for the 'short documents' characteristic of P2P, which significantly improves both precision and recall in 'top results' P2P search. We construct a dynamic entity corpus using n-grams statistics and metadata, study its reliability, and use it to identify correlations between user query terms.
1390543	Site-based dynamic pruning for query processing in search engines Web search engines typically index and retrieve at the page level. In this study, we investigate a dynamic pruning strategy that allows the query processor to first determine the most promising websites and then proceed with the similarity computations for those pages only within these sites.
1390544	Exploiting MDS Projections for Cross-language IR In this paper, we describe some preliminary work on using monolingual projections of document collections for performing cross-language information retrieval tasks. The proposed methodology uses multidimensional scaling for projecting the vector-space representations of a given multilingual document collection into spaces of lower dimensionality. An independent projection is computed for each different language, and the structural similarities of the resulting projections are exploited for information retrieval tasks.
1390545	Local approximation of PageRank and reverse PageRank We consider the problem of approximating the PageRank of a target node using only local information provided by a link server. We prove that local approximation of PageRank is feasible if and only if the graph has low in-degree and admits fast PageRank convergence. While natural graphs, such as the web graph, are abundant with high in-degree nodes, making local PageRank approximation too costly, we show that reverse natural graphs tend to have low indegree while maintaining fast PageRank convergence. It follows that calculating Reverse PageRank locally is frequently more feasible than computing PageRank locally. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of Reverse PageRank in five different applications.
1390546	Improving text classification accuracy using topic modeling over an additional corpus The World Wide Web has many document repositories that can act as valuable sources of additional data for various machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a method of improving text classification accuracy by using such an additional corpus that can easily be obtained from the web. This additional corpus can be unlabeled and independent of the given classification task. The method proposed here uses topic modeling to extract a set of topics from the additional corpus. Those extracted topics then act as additional features of the data of the given classification task. An evaluation on the RCV1 dataset shows significant improvement over a baseline method.
1390547	An algorithm for text categorization A novel and efficient learning algorithm is proposed for the binary linear classification problem. The algorithm is trained using the Rocchio's relevance feedback technique and builds a classifier by the intermediate hyperplane of two common tangent hyperplanes for the given category and its complement. Experimental results presented are very encouraging and justify the need for further research.
1390548	Hypergraph partitioning for document clustering: a unified clique perspective Hypergraph partitioning has been considered as a promising method to address the challenges of high dimensionality in document clustering. With documents modeled as vertices and the relationship among documents captured by the hyperedges, the goal of graph partitioning is to minimize the edge cut. Therefore, the definition of hyperedges is vital to the clustering performance. While several definitions of hyperedges have been proposed, a systematic understanding of desired characteristics of hyperedges is still missing. To that end, in this paper, we first provide a unified clique perspective of the definition of hyperedges, which serves as a guide to define hyperedges. With this perspective, based on the concepts of hypercliques and shared (reverse) nearest neighbors, we propose three new types of clique hyperedges and analyze their properties regarding purity and size issues. Finally, we present an extensive evaluation using real-world document datasets. The experimental results show that, with shared (reverse) nearest neighbor based hyperedges, the clustering performance can be improved significantly in terms of various external validation measures without the need for fine tuning of parameters.
1390549	Pagerank based clustering of hypertext document collections Clustering hypertext document collection is an important task in Information Retrieval. Most clustering methods are based on document content and do not take into account the hyper-text links. Here we propose a novel PageRank based clustering (PRC) algorithm which uses the hypertext structure. The PRC algorithm produces graph partitioning with high modularity and coverage. The comparison of the PRC algorithm with two content based clustering algorithms shows that there is a good match between PRC clustering and content based clustering.

1390551	Relational distance-based collaborative filtering In this paper, we present a novel hybrid recommender system called RelationalCF , which integrate content and demographic information into a collaborative filtering framework by using relational distance computation approaches without the effort of form transformation and feature construction.

1390554	Clustering search results for mobile terminals Mobile terminals such as cell phones are much more restricted in terms of input/output functionality and, therefore, some special techniques must be incorporated to enable them to be easily used for Web searching. Further, searching for a location name is related to a dazzling variety of topics. We relate these two factors to each other to yield a new search system for map and text information. Presenting search results as clusters is helpful for users, especially in a mobile environment. The system makes mobile web searching easier and more efficient.

1390557	Cross-lingual search over 22 european languages In this paper we present a system for cross-lingual information retrieval, which can handle tens of languages and millions of documents. Functioning of the system is demonstrated on corpus of European Legislation (22 languages, more than 400,000 documents per language). The system uses an interactive web-interface, which can take advantage of a predefined thesaurus allowing the user to dynamically re-rank the retrieval results based on the mapping onto a predefined thesaurus.
1390558	Social recommendations at work Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content, and also for connecting to other users. User-generated content includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. Items can be annotated and rated by different users, and users can connect to others that are usually friends and/or share common interests. We demonstrate a social recommendation system that takes advantages of users connections and tagging behavior to compute recommendations of items in such communities. The advantages can be verified via comparison to a standard IR technique.

1390563	From concepts to implementation and visualization: tools from a team-based approach to ir Researchers have been studying and developing teaching materials for information retrieval (IR), such as [3]. Toolkits also have been built that provide hands-on experience to students. For example, IR-Toolbox [4] is an effort to close the gap between the students' understanding of IR concepts and real-life indexing and search systems. Such tools might be good for helping students in non-technical areas such as in the Library and Information Science field to develop their conceptual model of search engines. However, they do not cover emerging topics and skills, such as content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and fusion search. Although there is open source software (such as those in http://www.searchtools.com/tools/tools-opensource.html) that can be used to teach basic and advanced IR topics, they require a student to have high-level technical knowledge and to spend a long time to gain a practical understanding of these topics. We present a new and rapid approach to teach basic and advanced IR topics, such as text retrieval, web-based IR, CBIR, and fusion search, to Computer Science (CS) graduate students. We designed projects that would help students grasp the abovementioned IR topics. Students, working in teams, were given a practical application to start with -- the Superimposed Application for Image Description and Retrieval [5]. SAIDR (earlier, SIERRA) allows users to associate parts of images with multimedia information such as text annotations. Also, users may retrieve information in one of two 2 ways: (1) Perform text-based retrieval on annotations; (2) Perform CBIR on images and parts of images that look like a query image (or part of a query image). Each team was asked to build an enhancement for this application, involving text retrieval and/or CBIR, in three weeks time. The sub-projects are described in Table 1. The outcome of this activity was that students learned about IR concepts while being able to relate their applicability to a real world problem (Figure 1). Details of these projects may be found at http://collab.dlib.vt.edu/runwiki/wiki.pl?TabletPcImageRetrievalSuperimposedInformation. We will demonstrate the tools developed along with the IR concepts they illustrate (Table 1). We believe these tools may aid others to learn about basic and advanced topics in IR.
1390565	Exploiting XML structure to improve information retrieval in peer-to-peer systems With the advent of XML as a standard for representation and exchange of structured documents, a growing amount of XML-documents are being stored in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Cur¬rent research on P2P search engines proposes the use of Informa¬tion Retrieval (IR) techniques to perform content-based search, but does not take into account structural features of documents. P2P systems typically have no central index, thus avoiding single-points-of-failures, but distribute all information among participating peers. Accordingly, a querying peer has only limited access to the index information and should select carefully which peers can help answering a given query by contributing resources such as local index information or CPU time for ranking computations. Bandwidth consumption is a major issue. To guarantee scalability, P2P systems have to reduce the number of peers involved in the retrieval process. As a result, the retrieval quality in terms of recall and precision may suffer substantially. In the proposed thesis, document structure is considered as an extra source of information to improve the retrieval quality of XML-documents in a P2P environment. The thesis centres on the following questions: how can structural information help to improve the retrieval of XML-documents in terms of result quality such as precision, recall, and specificity? Can XML structure support the routing of queries in distributed environments, especially the selection of promising peers? How can XML IR techniques be used in a P2P network while minimizing bandwidth consumption and considering performance aspects? To answer these questions and to analyze possible achievements, a search engine is proposed that exploits structural hints expressed explicitly by the user or implicitly by the self-describing structure of XML-documents. Additionally, more focused and specific results are obtained by providing ranked retrieval units that can be either XML-documents as a whole or the most relevant passages of theses documents. XML information retrieval techniques are applied in two ways: to select those peers participating in the retrieval process, and to compute the relevance of documents. The indexing approach includes both content and structural information of documents. To support efficient execution of multi term queries, index keys consist of rare combinations of (content, structure)-tuples. Performance is increased by using only fixedsized posting lists: frequent index keys are combined with each other iteratively until the new combination is rare, with a posting list size under a pre-set threshold. All posting lists are sorted by taking into account classical IR measures such as term frequency and inverted term frequency as well as weights for potential retrieval units of a document, with a slight bias towards documents on peers with good collections regarding the current index key and with good peer characteristics such as online times, available bandwidth, and latency. When extracting the posting list for a specific query, a re-ordering on the posting list is performed that takes into account the structural similarity between key and query. According to this preranking, peers are selected that are expected to hold information about potentially relevant documents and retrieval units The final ranking is computed in parallel on those selected peers. The computation is based on an extension of the vector space model and distinguishes between weights for different structures of the same content. This allows weighting XML elements with respect to their discriminative power, e.g. a title will be weighted much higher than a footnote. Additionally, relevance is computed as a mixture of content relevance and structural similarity between a given query and a potential retrieval unit. Currently, a first prototype for P2P Information Retrieval of XML-documents called SPIRIX is being implemented. Experiments to evaluate the proposed techniques and use of structural hints will be performed on a distributed version of the INEX Wikipedia Collection.
1390566	Affective feedback: an investigation into the role of emotions in the information seeking process User feedback is considered to be a critical element in the information seeking process. An important aspect of the feedback cycle is relevance assessment that has progressively become a popular practice in web searching activities and interactive information retrieval (IR). The value of relevance assessment lies in the disambiguation of the user's information need, which is achieved by applying various feedback techniques. Such techniques vary from explicit to implicit and help determine the relevance of the retrieved documents. The former type of feedback is usually obtained through the explicit and intended indication of documents as relevant (positive feedback) or irrelevant (negative feedback). Explicit feedback is a robust method for improving a system's overall retrieval performance and producing better query reformulations [1], at the expense of users' cognitive resources. On the other hand, implicit feedback techniques tend to collect information on search behavior in a more intelligent and unobtrusive manner. By doing so, they disengage the users from the cognitive burden of document rating and relevance judgments. Information-seeking activities such as reading time, saving, printing, selecting and referencing have been all treated as indicators of relevance, despite the lack of sufficient evidence to support their effectiveness [2]. Besides their apparent differences, both categories of feedback techniques determine document relevance with respect to the cognitive and situational levels of the interactive dialogue that occurs between the user and the retrieval system [5]. However, this approach does not account for the dynamic interplay and adaptation that takes place between the different dialogue levels, but most importantly it does not consider the affective dimension of interaction. Users interact with intentions, motivations and feelings apart from real-life problems and information objects, which are all critical aspects of cognition and decision-making [3][4]. By evaluating users' affective response towards an information object (e.g. a document), prior and post to their exposure to it, a more accurate understanding of the object's properties and degree of relevance to the current information need may be facilitated. Furthermore, systems that can detect and respond accordingly to user emotions could potentially improve the naturalness of human-computer interaction and progressively optimize their retrieval strategy. The current study investigates the role of emotions in the information seeking process, as the latter are communicated through multi-modal interaction, and reconsiders relevance feedback with respect to what occurs on the affective level of interaction as well.
1390567	Exploring and measuring dependency trees for informationretrieval Natural language processing techniques are believed to hold a tremendous potential to supplement the purely quantitative methods of text information retrieval. This has led to the emergence of a large number of NLP-based IR research projects over the last few years, even though the empirical evidence to support this has often been inadequate. Most contributions of NLP to IR mainly concentrate on document representation and compound term matching strategies. Researchers have noted that the simple term-based representation of document content such as vector representation is usually inadequate for accurate discrimination. The "bag of words" representation does not invoke linguistic considerations and allow modelling of relationships between subsets of words. However, even though a variety of content indicator such as syntactic phrase have been tried and investigated for representing documents rather than single terms in IR systems, the matching strategy over those representation still cannot go beyond traditional statistical techniques that measure term co-occurrence characteristics and proximity in analyzing text structure. In this paper, we propose a novel IR strategy (SIR) with NLP techniques involved at the syntactic level. Within SIR, documents and query representation are built on the basis of a syntactic data structure of the natural language text - the dependency tree, in which syntactic relationships between words are identified and structured in the form of a tree. In order to capture the syntactic relations between words in their hierarchical structural representation, the matching strategy in SIR upgrades from the traditional statistical techniques by introducing a similarity measure method executing on the graph representation level as the key determiner. A basic IR experiment is designed and implemented on the TREC data to evaluate if this novel IR model is feasible. Experimental results indicate that this approach has the potential to outperform the standard bag of words IR model, especially in response to syntactical structured queries.

1390569	Task detection for activity-based desktop search The desktop search tools provide powerful query capabilities and result presentation techniques. However, they do not take the user context into account. We propose to exploit collected information about user activities with desktop files and applications for activity-based desktop search. When I prepare for a project review and type in a search box the name of a colleague, I expect to find her last deliverable draft, but not her email with a paper review or our joint conference presentation. Ideally, the desktop search system should be able to infer my current task from the logs of my previous activities and present task-specific search results.

1390574	Context and linking in retrieval from personal digital archives Advances in digital capture and storage technologies mean that it is now possible to capture and store one's entire life experiences in personal digital archives. These vast personal archives (or Human Digital Memories (HDMs)) pose new challenges and opportunities for the research community, not the least of which is developing effective means of retrieval from HDMs. Personal archive retrieval research is still in its infancy and there is much scope for novel research. My PhD proposes to develop effective HDM retrieval algorithms by combining rich sources of context associated with items, such as location and people present data, with information obtained by linking HDM items in novel ways.
1390575	Extending language modeling techniques to models of search and browsing activity in a digital library Users searching for information in a digital library or on the WWW can be modeled as individuals moving through a semantic space by issuing queries and clicking on hyperlinks. As they go, they emit a stream of interaction data. Most of it is linguistic data. Lots of it is captured in logs. Some of it is used to guess what the user is searching for. But to most information retrieval systems, each user interaction is a stateless point in this space. There is a timeline connecting each of these points, but systems seldom make use of this as sequence data, in part because there is no clear way to systematically characterize the meaningful relations within a sequence of user activity. It is a problem of pragmatics as much as it is of semantics--the fact that a user clicked on a particular link, or added a particular term to their query, has meaning primarily in relation to the preceding actions. A remaining challenge in IR is to extract features of the user interaction data that will give meaning to those relations. Meanwhile, from the user's perspective each of these points in time and semantic space are just part of a path of exploration. To the user, the exact terms in a query, or the specific words surrounding a hypertext link, may be less important than the trajectory those terms establish in relation to the user's path. Identifying the meaningful relations between queries and page views within a sequence of activity increases our understanding of users and their information needs. Formally, we can model query and browsing behaviors as surface forms of a hidden process. What is missing is a layer of abstraction for mapping sequences of interaction in a way that is both descriptive of users' needs and useful to automation. The work I describe is an effort to identify features of data in logs of query and browsing activity that are highly predictive of certain types of behavior. Sequences of interaction data from individual users are modeled as sequences of expression. Statistical modeling techniques that are effective for modeling sequences in natural language processing and bioinformatics are examined for their ability to model sequences of interaction between an information searcher and an information retrieval system. Queries and click-throughs in this stream of interaction can be tagged with features such as semantic coordinates, timing, frequency of use, type of action, etc. By analyzing large collections of interaction sequences it is possible to identify frequent patterns of user behavior. From these patterns we can make predictions about future interactions. For example, certain patterns of link following in a digital library are highly predictive of users' next steps while other patterns are not. General models of user interaction are useful for design and evaluation of search interfaces. Individual models of user interaction are useful for personalized search and customized content. Yet very little research has been done to investigate which features are optimal for modeling user queries and browsing as interaction sequences. An important first step is to identify informative features and the relationships between features. I propose to construct models of user behavior based on user data in logs of query and browsing activity and to identify features that are highly predictive of certain types of user behaviors. I examine activity within search sessions on a digital library as a microcosm of larger systems. I expect to find features that are useful in predictive models of user behavior both at an individual and aggregate level. Where possible, I hope to identify meaningful relationships between those features. The work has implications beyond the scope of digital libraries, to larger systems and broader search domains.
564377	Landmarks in information retrieval: the message out of the bottle For many years I have wanted to give a talk like this: look back on our subject, identify the high (and perhaps low) points, consider what worked, what did not work, and speculate a little about the future. Now that I at last have the opportunity to give such a talk the realisation has dawned just how difficult it is to do justice to the topic. The only way out of this difficulty for me is to emphasise that this is a personal account, based on my involvement with the field since 1968, and that errors of omission and commission are not deliberate but simply due to lack of knowledge and time on my part. To talk of landmarks is easy but to say what they are in IR is not. They come in various shapes and sizes: events, publications, experiment, ideas, etc. In the course of this presentation I shall be judiciously mixing all of these. However, the emphasis will be on ideas and their subsequent modelling and testing through experimentation. The interaction between theory and experiment will be a recurring theme. I will try and associate these developments with key individuals, thereby running the risk of ignoring some; I apologise for this in advance. The pre-history of our subject can be traced back to the work in the 19th century, perhaps even further, but I will pick it up at the middle of the last century (20th) starting with the work of Robert Fairthorne and Vannevar Bush. This early work emphasised the possibility of using mechanical devices to store and retrieve information. Of course the foundations of modern information retrieval were properly laid after 1945 with the pioneering work of Cleverdon, Salton, Sparck Jones, and others. This work gave rise to a strong experimental methodology for the evaluation of theoretical ideas, which has been sustained to this day. It has been a hallmark of IR research that theory is developed in the context of experimentation. There is no doubt that many disciplines are jealous of the success of TREC. IR research has thrown up a number of successful models. These models have been based on some, often unstated, assumptions (or hypotheses). I will attempt to identify some of the underlying ideas, giving credit where is due, that led to the fruitful exploration of retrieval models. This will include system-oriented as well as user-oriented ideas, especially those concerned with the measurement of retrieval performance. IR has been fortunate in that the subject has grown through the active collaboration between computer scientists and information scientists. This has meant that traditional approaches to the storage and retrieval of information emanating from the library world, for example, have always strongly influenced new developments. This tension between manual (human) processes and automatic computer-based processes in IR has always been fruitful. Even now with the evolution of ideas about meta-data and ontologies needed to enhance web retrieval, the debate about controlled vocabularies versus automatic indexing is relevant. Issues of scalability are particularly important here. One of the strengths that have emerged in our subject is that many of our models can be deployed independently of medium or modality. For example, retrieving images or audio sequences can be handled in ways similar to those used to retrieve text data. This has proved to be great boon to IR. The development of web retrieval through the deployment of various kinds of search engines has been based on the considerable early work in IR although detailing the specific influences is not easy. It is clear that the underlying mathematical and statistical models in IR have been ubiquitous in application. The extreme difficulty encountered in making NLP work for IR forced researchers to develop powerful statistical, probabilistic, geometrical, and logical techniques to complement linguistic ones. This is now paying off because of the similar difficulties encountered in other media. Having given some account of how we got here I will spend a little time talking about where we go from here, how do we extract the message from the bottle?
564378	Is natural language an inconvenience or an opportunity for IR? Natural language (NL) has evolved to facilitate human communication. It enables the speaker to make the listener's mind wander among her experiences and mental associations roughly according to the intentions of the speaker. The speaker and the listener usually share experiences and expectations, and they use mostly the same units and rules of a shared NL. Written language functions similarly, but in a less interactive way, with fewer possibilities for feedback.Both the symbols of NL (i.e. words or morphemes), and their arrangements are meaningful. Not with universal and precise meanings, but similar enough among different speakers and accurate enough for the communication mostly to succeed.NLs are mostly very large systems. Hundreds of thousands of words and infinitely many possible utterances. Even inflection alone might produce huge numbers of forms, e.g. more than ten thousand distinct forms out of every Finnish verb entry.NL processing (for IR or any other purpose) must cope with phenomena like (1) inflection and compounding, (2) synonymy, (3) polysemy, (4) ambiguity, (5) anaphora and (6) head-modifier relations among words and phrases.Language technology can neutralize much of the effect of these 'inconveniences' inherent with NL, but what kinds of advantages could NL have? Redundant use of synonymous expressions can effectively identify new concepts. Multilingual parallel documents may help in identifying their exact content. NLs typically carry connotations, i.e. what is implied but not explicitly said (e.g. attitudes, politeness). Vague associations are easy to express in NL, but not always in formal systems (e.g. "a few years ago there was an article about the rival of Yeltsin - I don't remember his name but - he then went over to some region in Siberia - but what did the guy promise?") Jokes and humor belong to NLs, not to formal systems. .Are there any alternatives for NL? Not really, because any artificial and more precise formalisms fail to adapt to new concepts and they do not easily allow restructuring of previous ideas.One challenge for language technology is to find better solutions for the above 'inconveniences' in order to provide various IR, document classification, indexing and summarizing methods with more accurate and adequate input data. With more accurate input some of the more demanding tasks of IR can perhaps be solved.
564380	Impact transformation: effective and efficient web retrieval We extend the applicability of impact transformation, which is a technique for adjusting the term weights assigned to documents so as to boost the effectiveness of retrieval when short queries are applied to large document collections. In conjunction with techniques called quantization and thresholding, impact transformation allows improved query execution rates compared to traditional vector-space similarity computations, as the number of arithmetic operations can be reduced. The transformation also facilitates a new dynamic query pruning heuristic. We give results based upon the trec web data that show the combination of these various techniques to yield highly competitive retrieval, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, for both short and long queries.
564381	Analysis of lexical signatures for finding lost or related documents A lexical signature of a web page is often sufficient for finding the page, even if its URL has changed. We conduct a large-scale empirical study of eight methods for generating lexical signatures, including Phelps and Wilensky's [14] original proposal (PW) and seven of our own variations. We examine their performance on the web and on a TREC data set, evaluating their ability both to uniquely identify the original document and to locate other relevant documents if the original is lost. Lexical signatures chosen to minimize document frequency (DF) are good at unique identification but poor at finding relevant documents. PW works well on the relatively small TREC data set, but acts almost identically to DF on the web, which contains billions of documents. Term-frequency-based lexical signatures (TF) are very easy to compute and often perform well, but are highly dependent on the ranking system of the search engine used. In general, TFIDF-based method and hybrid methods (which combine DF with TF or TFIDF) seem to be the most promising candidates for generating effective lexical signatures.
564382	Using sampled data and regression to merge search engine results This paper addresses the problem of merging results obtained from different databases and search engines in a distributed information retrieval environment. The prior research on this problem either assumed the exchange of statistics necessary for normalizing scores (cooperative solutions) or is heuristic. Both approaches have disadvantages. We show that the problem in uncooperative environments is simpler when viewed as a component of a distributed IR system that uses query-based sampling to create resource descriptions. Documents sampled for creating resource descriptions can also be used to create a sample centralized index, and this index is a source of training data for adaptive results merging algorithms. A variety of experiments demonstrate that this new approach is more effective than a well-known alternative, and that it allows query-by-query tuning of the results merging function.
564383	The Importance of Prior Probabilities for Entry Page Search An important class of searches on the world-wide-web has the goal to find an entry page (homepage) of an organisation. Entry page search is quite different from Ad Hoc search. Indeed a plain Ad Hoc system performs disappointingly. We explored three non-content features of web pages: page length, number of incoming links and URL form. Especially the URL form proved to be a good predictor. Using URL form priors we found over 70% of all entry pages at rank 1, and up to 89% in the top 10. Non-content features can easily be embedded in a language model framework as a prior probability.
564385	Term-specific smoothing for the language modeling approach to information retrieval: the importance of a query term This paper follows a formal approach to information retrieval based on statistical language models. By introducing some simple reformulations of the basic language modeling approach we introduce the notion of importance of a query term. The importance of a query term is an unknown parameter that explicitly models which of the query terms are generated from the relevant documents (the important terms), and which are not (the unimportant terms). The new language modeling approach is shown to explain a number of practical facts of today's information retrieval systems that are not very well explained by the current state of information retrieval theory, including stop words, mandatory terms, coordination level ranking and retrieval using phrases.
564386	Title language model for information retrieval In this paper, we propose a new language model, namely, a title language model, for information retrieval. Different from the traditional language model used for retrieval, we define the conditional probability P(Q|D) as the probability of using query Q as the title for document D. We adopted the statistical translation model learned from the title and document pairs in the collection to compute the probability P(Q|D). To avoid the sparse data problem, we propose two new smoothing methods. In the experiments with four different TREC document collections, the title language model for information retrieval with the new smoothing method outperforms both the traditional language model and the vector space model for IR significantly.
564387	Two-stage language models for information retrieval The optimal settings of retrieval parameters often depend on both the document collection and the query, and are usually found through empirical tuning. In this paper, we propose a family of two-stage language models for information retrieval that explicitly captures the different influences of the query and document collection on the optimal settings of retrieval parameters. As a special case, we present a two-stage smoothing method that allows us to estimate the smoothing parameters completely automatically. In the first stage, the document language model is smoothed using a Dirichlet prior with the collection language model as the reference model. In the second stage, the smoothed document language model is further interpolated with a query background language model. We propose a leave-one-out method for estimating the Dirichlet parameter of the first stage, and the use of document mixture models for estimating the interpolation parameter of the second stage. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.
564389	Finding relevant documents using top ranking sentences: an evaluation of two alternative schemes In this paper we present an evaluation of techniques that are designed to encourage web searchers to interact more with the results of a web search. Two specific techniques are examined: the presentation of sentences that highly match the searcher's query and the use of implicit evidence. Implicit evidence is evidence captured from the searcher's interaction with the retrieval results and is used to automatically update the display. Our evaluation concentrates on the effectiveness and subject perception of these techniques. The results show, with statistical significance, that the techniques are effective and efficient for information seeking.
564390	Predicting category accesses for a user in a structured information space In a categorized information space, predicting users' information needs at the category level can facilitate personalization, caching and other topic-oriented services. This paper presents a two-phase model to predict the category of a user's next access based on previous accesses. Phase 1 generates a snapshot of a user's preferences among categories based on a temporal and frequency analysis of the user's access history. Phase 2 uses the computed preferences to make predictions at different category granularities. Several alternatives for each phase are evaluated, using the rating behaviors of on-line raters as the form of access considered. The results show that a method based on re-access pattern and frequency analysis of a user's whole history has the best prediction quality, even over a path-based method (Markov model) that uses the combined history of all users.
564391	Detecting and Browsing Events in Unstructured text Previews and overviews of large, heterogeneous information resources help users comprehend the scope of collections and focus on particular subsets of interest. For narrative documents, questions of "what happened? where? and when?" are natural points of entry. Building on our earlier work at the Perseus Project with detecting terms, place names, and dates, we have exploited co-occurrences of dates and place names to detect and describe likely events in document collections. We compare statistical measures for determining the relative significance of various events. We have built interfaces that help users preview likely regions of interest for a given range of space and time by plotting the distribution and relevance of various collocations. Users can also control the amount of collocation information in each view. Once particular collocations are selected, the system can identify key phrases associated with each possible event to organize browsing of the documents themselves.
564393	Novelty and redundancy detection in adaptive filtering This paper addresses the problem of extending an adaptive information filtering system to make decisions about the novelty and redundancy of relevant documents. It argues that relevance and redundance should each be modelled explicitly and separately. A set of five redundancy measures are proposed and evaluated in experiments with and without redundancy thresholds. The experimental results demonstrate that the cosine similarity metric and a redundancy measure based on a mixture of language models are both effective for identifying redundant documents.
564394	Improving realism of topic tracking evaluation Topic tracking and information filtering are models of interactive tasks, but their evaluations are generally done in a way that does not reflect likely usage. The models either force frequent judgments or disallow any at all, assume the user is always available to make a judgment, and do not allow for user fatigue. In this study we extend the evaluation framework for topic tracking to incorporate those more realistic issues. We demonstrate that tracking can be done in a realistic interactive setting with minimal impact on tracking cost and with substantial reduction in required interaction.
564395	Bayesian online classifiers for text classification and filtering This paper explores the use of Bayesian online classifiers to classify text documents. Empirical results indicate that these classifiers are comparable with the best text classification systems. Furthermore, the online approach offers the advantage of continuous learning in the batch-adaptive text filtering task.
564397	The use of unlabeled data to improve supervised learning for text summarization With the huge amount of information available electronically, there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. The use of machine learning techniques for this task allows one to adapt summaries to the user needs and to the corpus characteristics. These desirable properties have motivated an increasing amount of work in this field over the last few years. Most approaches attempt to generate summaries by extracting sentence segments and adopt the supervised learning paradigm which requires to label documents at the text span level. This is a costly process, which puts strong limitations on the applicability of these methods. We investigate here the use of semi-supervised algorithms for summarization. These techniques make use of few labeled data together with a larger amount of unlabeled data. We propose new semi-supervised algorithms for training classification models for text summarization. We analyze their performances on two data sets - the Reuters news-wire corpus and the Computation and Language (cmp_lg) collection of TIPSTER SUMMAC. We perform comparisons with a baseline - non learning - system, and a reference trainable summarizer system.
564398	Generic summarization and keyphrase extraction using mutual reinforcement principle and sentence clustering A novel method for simultaneous keyphrase extraction and generic text summarization is proposed by modeling text documents as weighted undirected and weighted bipartite graphs. Spectral graph clustering algorithms are useed for partitioning sentences of the documents into topical groups with sentence link priors being exploited to enhance clustering quality. Within each topical group, saliency scores for keyphrases and sentences are generated based on a mutual reinforcement principle. The keyphrases and sentences are then ranked according to their saliency scores and selected for inclusion in the top keyphrase list and summaries of the document. The idea of building a hierarchy of summaries for documents capturing different levels of granularity is also briefly discussed. Our method is illustrated using several examples from news articles, news broadcast transcripts and web documents.
564399	Cross-document summarization by concept classification In this paper we describe a Cross Document Summarizer XDoX designed specifically to summarize large document sets (50-500 documents and more). Such sets of documents are typically obtained from routing or filtering systems run against a continuous stream of data, such as a newswire. XDoX works by identifying the most salient themes within the set (at the granularity level that is regulated by the user) and composing an extraction summary, which reflects these main themes. In the current version, XDoX is not optimized to produce a summary based on a few unrelated documents; indeed, such summaries are best obtained simply by concatenating summaries of individual documents. We show examples of summaries obtained in our tests as well as from our participation in the first Document Understanding Conference (DUC).
564401	Unsupervised document classification using sequential information maximization We present a novel sequential clustering algorithm which is motivated by the Information Bottleneck (IB) method. In contrast to the agglomerative IB algorithm, the new sequential ( sIB ) approach is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the information with time and space complexity typically linear in the data size. information, as required by the original IB principle. Moreover, the time and space complexity are significantly improved. We apply this algorithm to unsupervised document classification. In our evaluation, on small and medium size corpora, the sIB is found to be consistently superior to all the other clustering methods we examine, typically by a significant margin. Moreover, the sIB results are comparable to those obtained by a supervised Naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we propose a simple procedure for trading cluster's recall to gain higher precision, and show how this approach can extract clusters which match the existing topics of the corpus almost perfectly.
564402	Topic difference factor extraction between two document sets and its application to text categorization To improve performance in text categorization, it is important to extract distinctive features for each class. This paper proposes topic difference factor analysis (TDFA) as a method to extract projection axes that reflect topic differences between two document sets. Suppose all sentence vectors that compose each document are projected onto projection axes. TDFA obtains the axes that maximize the ratio between the document sets as to the sum of squared projections by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The axes are called topic difference factors (TDF's). By applying TDFA to the document set that belongs to a given class and a set of documents that is misclassified as belonging to that class by an existent classifier, we can obtain features that take large values in the given class but small ones in other classes, as well as features that take large values in other classes but small ones in the given class. A classifier was constructed applying the above features to complement the kNN classifier. As the results, the micro averaged F 1 measure for Reuters-21578 improved from 83.69 to 87.27%.
564403	Text genre classification with genre-revealing and subject-revealing features Subject or prepositional content has been the focus of most classification research. Genre or style, on the other hand, is a different and important property of text, and automatic text genre classification is becoming important for classification and retrieval purposes as well as for some natural language processing research. In this paper, we present a method for automatic genre classification that is based on statistically selected features obtained from both subject-classified and genre classified training data. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a direct application of a statistical learner often used for subject classification. We also observe that the deviation formula and discrimination formula using document frequency ratios also work as expected. We conjecture that this dual feature set approach can be generalized to improve the performance of subject classification as well.
564404	A new family of online algorithms for category ranking We describe a new family of topic-ranking algorithms for multi-labeled documents. The motivation for the algorithms stems from recent advances in online learning algorithms. The algorithms we present are simple to implement and are time and memory efficient. We evaluate the algorithms on the Reuters-21578 corpus and the new corpus released by Reuters in 2000. On both corpora the algorithms we present outperform adaptations to topic-ranking of Rocchio's algorithm and the Perceptron algorithm. We also outline the formal analysis of the algorithm in the mistake bound model. To our knowledge, this work is the first to report performance results with the entire new Reuters corpus.
564406	Comparing cross-language query expansion techniques by degrading translation resources The quality of translation resources is arguably the most important factor affecting the performance of a cross-language information retrieval system. While many investigations have explored the use of query expansion techniques to combat errors induced by translation, no study has yet examined the effectiveness of these techniques across resources of varying quality. This paper presents results using parallel corpora and bilingual wordlists that have been deliberately degraded prior to query translation. Across different languages, translingual resources, and degrees of resource degradation, pre-translation query expansion is tremendously effective. In several instances, pre-translation expansion results in better performance when no translations are available, than when an uncompromised resource is used without pre-translation expansion. We also demonstrate that post-translation expansion using relevance feedback can confer modest performance gains. Measuring the efficacy of these techniques with resources of different quality suggests an explanation for the conflicting reports that have appeared in the literature.
564407	Statistical cross-language information retrieval using n-best query translations This paper presents a novel statistical model for cross-language information retrieval. Given a written query in the source language, documents in the target language are ranked by integrating probabilities computed by two statistical models: a query-translation model, which generates most probable term-by-term translations of the query, and a query-document model, which evaluates the likelihood of each document and translation. Integration of the two scores is performed over the set of N most probable translations of the query. Experimental results with values N =1, 5, 10 are presented on the Italian-English bilingual track data used in the CLEF 2000 and 2001 evaluation campaigns.
564408	Cross-lingual relevance models We propose a formal model of Cross-Language Information Retrieval that does not rely on either query translation or document translation. Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language. The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework. We describe how the topic model can be estimated with either a parallel corpus or a dictionary. We test the framework by constructing Chinese topic models from English queries and using them in the CLIR task of TREC9. The model achieves performance around 95% of the strong mono-lingual baseline in terms of average precision. In initial precision, our model outperforms the mono-lingual baseline by 20%. The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval.
564409	Resolving query translation ambiguity using a decaying co-occurrence model and syntactic dependence relations Bilingual dictionaries have been commonly used for query translation in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). However, we are faced with the problem of translation selection. Several recent studies suggested the utilization of term co-occurrences in this selection. This paper presents two extensions to improve them. First, we extend the basic co-occurrence model by adding a decaying factor that decreases the mutual information when the distance between the terms increases. Second, we incorporate a triple translation model, in which syntactic dependence relations (represented as triples) are integrated. Our evaluation on translation accuracy shows that translating triples as units is more precise than a word-by-word translation. Our CLIR experiments show that the addition of the decaying factor leads to substantial improvements of the basic co-occurrence model; and the triple translation model brings further improvements.
564411	Document clustering with cluster refinement and model selection capabilities In this paper, we propose a document clustering method that strives to achieve: (1) a high accuracy of document clustering, and (2) the capability of estimating the number of clusters in the document corpus (i.e. the model selection capability). To accurately cluster the given document corpus, we employ a richer feature set to represent each document, and use the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) together with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to conduct an initial document clustering. From this initial result, we identify a set of discriminative featuresfor each cluster, and refine the initially obtained document clusters by voting on the cluster label of each document using this discriminative feature set. This self-refinement process of discriminative feature identification and cluster label voting is iteratively applied until the convergence of document clusters. On the other hand, the model selection capability is achieved by introducing randomness in the cluster initialization stage, and then discovering a value C for the number of clusters N by which running the document clustering process for a fixed number of times yields sufficiently similar results. Performance evaluations exhibit clear superiority of the proposed method with its improved document clustering and model selection accuracies. The evaluations also demonstrate how each feature as well as the cluster refinement process contribute to the document clustering accuracy.
564412	Document clustering with committees Document clustering is useful in many information retrieval tasks: document browsing, organization and viewing of retrieval results, generation of Yahoo-like hierarchies of documents, etc. The general goal of clustering is to group data elements such that the intra-group similarities are high and the inter-group similarities are low. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that is shown to produce higher quality clusters in document clustering tasks as compared to several well known clustering algorithms. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters (high intra-group similarity), called committees, that are well scattered in the similarity space (low inter-group similarity). The union of the committees is but a subset of all elements. The algorithm proceeds by assigning elements to their most similar committee. Evaluating cluster quality has always been a difficult task. We present a new evaluation methodology that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and manually constructed classes (the answer key). This evaluation measure is more intuitive and easier to interpret than previous evaluation measures.
564413	Probabilistic combination of text classifiers using reliability indicators: models and results The intuition that different text classifiers behave in qualitatively different ways has long motivated attempts to build a better metaclassifier via some combination of classifiers. We introduce a probabilistic method for combining classifiers that considers the context-sensitive reliabilities of contributing classifiers. The method harnesses reliability indicators ---variables that provide a valuable signal about the performance of classifiers in different situations. We provide background, present procedures for building metaclassifiers that take into consideration both reliability indicators and classifier outputs, and review a set of comparative studies undertaken to evaluate the methodology.
564415	Efficient phrase querying with an auxiliary index Search engines need to evaluate queries extremely fast, a challenging task given the vast quantities of data being indexed. A significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases. In this paper we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads. Previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes, but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files. We propose a combination of nextword indexes with inverted files as a solution to this problem. Our experiments show that combined use of an auxiliary nextword index and a conventional inverted file allow evaluation of phrase queries in half the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone, and the space overhead is only 10% of the size of the inverted file. Further time savings are available with only slight increases in disk requirements.
564416	Compression of inverted indexes For fast query evaluation Compression reduces both the size of indexes and the time needed to evaluate queries. In this paper, we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms, considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency: better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes. First, we propose several simple optimisations to well-known integer compression schemes, and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time. Second, we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency.In experiments on large collections of data, we show two surprising results: use of simple byte-aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact Golomb-Rice bitwise compression schemes; and, even when an index fits entirely in memory, byte-aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index, emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the CPU cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index. Moreover, byte-aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead: the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around 10% of the size of the collection, while a byte-aligned scheme is around 13%. We conclude that fast byte-aligned codes should be used to store integers in inverted lists.
564417	Set-based model: a new approach for information retrieval The objective of this paper is to present a new technique for computing term weights for index terms, which leads to a new ranking mechanism, referred to as set-based model. The components in our model are no longer terms, but termsets. The novelty is that we compute term weights using a data mining technique called association rules, which is time efficient and yet yields nice improvements in retrieval effectiveness. The set-based model function for computing the similarity between a document and a query considers the termset frequency in the document and its scarcity in the document collection. Experimental results show that our model improves the average precision of the answer set for all three collections evaluated. For the TReC-3 collection, our set-based model led to a gain, relative to the standard vector space model, of 37% in average precision curves and of 57% in average precision for the top 10 documents. Like the vector space model, the set-based model has time complexity that is linear in the number of documents in the collection.
564419	Collaborative filtering with privacy via factor analysis Collaborative filtering (CF) is valuable in e-commerce, and for direct recommendations for music, movies, news etc. But today's systems have several disadvantages, including privacy risks. As we move toward ubiquitous computing, there is a great potential for individuals to share all kinds of information about places and things to do, see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. In this paper we describe a new method for collaborative filtering which protects the privacy of individual data. The method is based on a probabilistic factor analysis model. Privacy protection is provided by a peer-to-peer protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper. The factor analysis approach handles missing data without requiring default values for them. We give several experiments that suggest that this is most accurate method for CF to date. The new algorithm has other advantages in speed and storage over previous algorithms. Finally, we suggest applications of the approach to other kinds of statistical analyses of survey or questionaire data.
564420	Inverted file search algorithms for collaborative filtering This paper explores the possibility of using a disk based inverted file structure for collaborative filtering. Our hypothesis is that this allows for faster calculation of predictions and also that early termination heuristics may be used to further speed up the filtering process and perhaps even improve the quality of the predictions. In an experiment on the EachMovie dataset this was tested. Our results indicate that searching the inverted file structure is many times faster than general in-memory vector search, even for very large profiles. The Continue termination heuristics produces the best ranked predictions in our experiments, and Quit is the top performer in terms of speed.
564421	Methods and metrics for cold-start recommendations We have developed a method for recommending items that combines content and collaborative data under a single probabilistic framework. We benchmark our algorithm against a naïve Bayes classifier on the cold-start problem, where we wish to recommend items that no one in the community has yet rated. We systematically explore three testing methodologies using a publicly available data set, and explain how these methods apply to specific real-world applications. We advocate heuristic recommenders when benchmarking to give competent baseline performance. We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems. Though the emphasis of our testing is on cold-start recommending, our methods for recommending and evaluation are general.
564423	Term selection for searching printed Arabic Since many Arabic documents are available only in print, automating retrieval from collections of scanned Arabic document images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an interesting problem. Arabic combines rich morphology with a writing system that presents unique challenges to OCR systems. These factors must be considered when selecting terms for automatic indexing. In this paper, alternative choices of indexing terms are explored using both an existing electronic text collection and a newly developed collection built from images of actual printed Arabic documents. Character n-grams or lightly stemmed words were found to typically yield near-optimal retrieval effectiveness, and combining both types of terms resulted in robust performance across a broad range of conditions.
564424	Empirical studies in strategies for Arabic retrieval This work evaluates a few search strategies for Arabic monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval, using the TREC Arabic corpus as the test-bed. The release by NIST in 2001 of an Arabic corpus of nearly 400k documents with both monolingual and cross-lingual queries and relevance judgments has been a new enabler for empirical studies. Experimental results show that spelling normalization and stemming can significantly improve Arabic monolingual retrieval. Character tri-grams from stems improved retrieval modestly on the test corpus, but the improvement is not statistically significant. To further improve retrieval, we propose a novel thesaurus-based technique. Different from existing approaches to thesaurus-based retrieval, ours formulates word synonyms as probabilistic term translations that can be automatically derived from a parallel corpus. Retrieval results show that the thesaurus can significantly improve Arabic monolingual retrieval. For cross-lingual retrieval (CLIR), we found that spelling normalization and stemming have little impact.
564425	Improving stemming for Arabic information retrieval: light stemming and co-occurrence analysis Arabic, a highly inflected language, requires good stemming for effective information retrieval, yet no standard approach to stemÂ¿ming has emerged. We developed several light stemmers based on heuristics and a statistical stemmer based on co-occurrence for Arabic retrieval. We compared the retrieval effectiveness of our stemmers and of a morphological analyzer on the TREC-2001 data. The best light stemmer was more effective for cross-lanÂ¿guage retrieval than a morphological stemmer which tried to find the root for each word. A repartitioning process consisting of vowel removal followed by clustering using co-occurrence analyÂ¿sis proÂ¿duced stem classes which were better than no stemming or very light stemming, but still inferior to good light stemming or morÂ¿phological analysis.
564427	Automatic query wefinement using lexical affinities with maximal information gain This work describes an automatic query refinement technique, which focuses on improving precision of the top ranked documents. The terms used for refinement are lexical affinities (LAs), pairs of closely related words which contain exactly one of the original query terms. Adding these terms to the query is equivalent to re-ranking search results, thus, precision is improved while recall is preserved. We describe a novel method that selects the most "informative" LAs for refinement, namely, those LAs that best separate relevant documents from irrelevant documents in the set of results. The information gain of candidate LAs is determined using unsupervised estimation that is based on the scoring function of the search engine. This method is thus fully automatic and its quality depends on the quality of the scoring function. Experiments we conducted with TREC data clearly show a significant improvement in the precision of the top ranked documents.
564428	Web question answering: is more always better? This paper describes a question answering system that is designed to capitalize on the tremendous amount of data that is now available online. Most question answering systems use a wide variety of linguistic resources. We focus instead on the redundancy available in large corpora as an important resource. We use this redundancy to simplify the query rewrites that we need to use, and to support answer mining from returned snippets. Our system performs quite well given the simplicity of the techniques being utilized. Experimental results show that question answering accuracy can be greatly improved by analyzing more and more matching passages. Simple passage ranking and n-gram extraction techniques work well in our system making it efficient to use with many backend retrieval engines.
564429	Predicting query performance We develop a method for predicting query performance by computing the relative entropy between a query language model and the corresponding collection language model. The resulting clarity score measures the coherence of the language usage in documents whose models are likely to generate the query. We suggest that clarity scores measure the ambiguity of a query with respect to a collection of documents and show that they correlate positively with average precision in a variety of TREC test sets. Thus, the clarity score may be used to identify ineffective queries, on average, without relevance information. We develop an algorithm for automatically setting the clarity score threshold between predicted poorly-performing queries and acceptable queries and validate it using TREC data. In particular, we compare the automatic thresholds to optimum thresholds and also check how frequently results as good are achieved in sampling experiments that randomly assign queries to the two classes.
564430	Using part-of-speech patterns to reduce query ambiguity Query ambiguity is a generally recognized problem, particularly in Web environments where queries are commonly only one or two words in length. In this study, we explore one technique that finds commonly occurring patterns of parts of speech near a one-word query and allows them to be transformed into clarification questions. We use a technique derived from statistical language modeling to show that the clarification queries will reduce ambiguity much of the time, and often quite substantially.
564432	The effect of topic set size on retrieval experiment error Retrieval mechanisms are frequently compared by computing the respective average scores for some effectiveness metric across a common set of information needs or topics, with researchers concluding one method is superior based on those averages. Since comparative retrieval system behavior is known to be highly variable across topics, good experimental design requires that a "sufficient" number of topics be used in the test. This paper uses TREC results to empirically derive error rates based on the number of topics used in a test and the observed difference in the average scores. The error rates quantify the likelihood that a different set of topics of the same size would lead to a different conclusion. We directly compute error rates for topic sets up to size 25, and extrapolate those rates for larger topic set sizes. The error rates found are larger than anticipated, indicating researchers need to take care when concluding one method is better than another, especially if few topics are used.
564433	Liberal relevance criteria of TREC -: counting on negligible documents? Most test collections (like TREC and CLEF) for experimental research in information retrieval apply binary relevance assessments. This paper introduces a four-point relevance scale and reports the findings of a project in which TREC-7 and TREC-8 document pools on 38 topics were reassessed. The goal of the reassessment was to build a subcollection of TREC for experiments on highly relevant documents and to learn about the assessment process as well as the characteristics of a multigraded relevance corpus.Relevance criteria were defined so that a distinction was made between documents rich in topical information (relevant and highly relevant documents) and poor in topical information (marginally relevant documents). It turned out that about 50% of documents assessed as relevant were regarded as marginal. The characteristics of the relevance corpus and lessons learned from the reassessment project are discussed. The need to develop more elaborated relevance assessment schemes is emphasized.
564435	Robust temporal and spectral modeling for query By melody Query by melody is the problem of retrieving musical performances from melodies. Retrieval of real performances is complicated due to the large number of variations in performing a melody and the presence of colored accompaniment noise. We describe a simple yet effective probabilistic model for this task. We describe a generative model that is rich enough to capture the spectral and temporal variations of musical performances and allows for tractable melody retrieval. While most of previous studies on music retrieval from melodies were performed with either symbolic (e.g. MIDI) data or with monophonic (single instrument) performances, we performed experiments in retrieving live and studio recordings of operas that contain a leading vocalist and rich instrumental accompaniment. Our results show that the probabilistic approach we propose is effective and can be scaled to massive datasets.
564436	Video retrieval using an MPEG-7 based inference network This work proposes a model for video retrieval based upon the inference network model. The document network is constructed using video metadata encoded using MPEG-7 and captures information pertaining to the structural aspects (video breakdown into shots and scenes), conceptual aspects (video, scene and shot content) and contextual aspects (context information about the position of conceptual content within the document). The retrieval process a) exploits the distribution of evidence among the shots to perform ranking of different levels of granularity, b) addresses the idea that evidence may be inherited during evaluation, and c) exploits the contextual information to perform constrained queries.
564438	Using self-supervised word segmentation in Chinese information retrieval We propose a self-supervised word-segmentation technique for Chinese information retrieval. This method combines the advantages of traditional dictionary based approaches with character based approaches, while overcoming many of their shortcomings. Experiments on TREC data show comparable performance to both the dictionary based and the character based approaches. However, our method is language independent and unsupervised, which provides a promising avenue for constructing accurate multilingual information retrieval systems that are flexible and adaptive.
564439	Automatic classification in product catalogs In this paper, we present the AutoCat system for product classification. AutoCat uses a vector space model, modified to consider product attributes unavailable in traditional document classification. We present key features of our user interface, developed to assist users with evaluating and editing the output of the classification algorithm. Finally, we present observations about the use of this technology in the field.
564440	PageRank, HITS and a unified framework for link analysis Two popular link-based webpage ranking algorithms are (i) PageRank[1] and (ii) HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Selection)[3]. HITS makes the crucial distinction of hubs and authorities and computes them in a mutually reinforcing way. PageRank considers the hyperlink weight normalization and the equilibrium distribution of random surfers as the citation score. We generalize and combine these key concepts into a unified framework, in which we prove that rankings produced by PageRank and HITS are both highly correlated with the ranking by in-degree and out-degree.

564442	Experiments in high-dimensional text categorization We present results for automated text categorization of the Reuters-810000 collection of news stories. Our experiments use the entire one-year collection of 810,000 stories and the entire subject index. We divide the data into monthly groups and provide an initial benchmark of text categorization performance on the complete collection. Experimental results show that efficient sparse-feature implementations of linear methods and decision trees, using a global unstemmed dictionary, can readily handle applications of this size. Predictive performance is approximately as strong as the best results for the much smaller older Reuters collections. Detailed results are provided over time periods. It is shown that a smaller time horizon does not diminish predictive quality, implying reduced demands for retraining when sample size is large.

564444	ICA and SOM in text document analysis In this study we show experimental results on using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) in document analysis. Our documents are segments of spoken dialogues carried out over the telephone in a customer service, transcribed into text. The task is to analyze the topics of the discussions, and to group the discussions into meaningful subsets. The quality of the grouping is studied by comparing to a manual topical classification of the documents.

564446	Do thumbnail previews help users make better relevance decisions about web search results? We describe an empirical evaluation of the utility of thumbnail previews in web search results. Results pages were constructed to show text-only summaries, thumbnail previews only, or the combination of text summaries and thumbnail previews. We found that in the combination case, users were able to make more accurate decisions about the potential relevance of results than in either of the other versions, with hardly any increase in speed of processing the page as a whole.

564448	The impact of corpus size on question answering performance Using our question answering system, questions from the TREC 2001 evaluation were executed over a series of Web data collections, with the sizes of the collections increasing from 25 gigabytes up to nearly a terabyte.
564449	Effective collection metasearch in a hierarchical environment: global vs. localized retrieval performance We compare standard global IR searching with user-centric localized techniques to address the database selection problem . We conduct a series of experiments to compare the retrieval effectiveness of three separate search modes applied to a hierarchically structured data environment of textual database representations. The data environment is represented as a tree-like directory containing over 15,000 unique databases and over 100,000 total leaf nodes. Our search modes consist of varying degrees of browse and search , from a global search at the root node to a refined search at a sub-node using dynamically-calculated inverse document frequencies ( idfs ) to score candidate databases for probable relevance. Our findings indicate that a browse and search approach that relies upon localized searching from sub-nodes is capable of producing the most effective results.

564451	The web retrieval task and its evaluation in the third NTCIR workshop This paper gives an overview of the evaluation method used for the Web Retrieval Task in the Third NTCIR Workshop, which is currently in progress. In the Web Retrieval Task, we try to assess the retrieval effectiveness of each Web search engine system using a common data set, and attempt to build a re-usable test collection suitable for evaluating Web search engine systems. With these objectives, we have built 100-gigabyte and 10-gigabyte document sets, mainly gathered from the '.jp' domain. Relevance judgment is performed on the retrieved documents, which are written in Japanese or English.
564452	How Many Bits are Needed to Store Term Frequencies? Search algorithms in most current text retrieval systems use index data structures extracted from the original text documents. In this paper we focus on reducing the size of the indices by reducing the amount of space dedicated to store term frequencies. In experiments using TREC Ad Hoc [2, 3] corpora and query sets, we show that it is possible to store the term frequency in only two bits without decreasing retrieval performance.
564453	Non-linear reading for a structured web indexation The growth of the Web has posed new challenges for Information Retrieval (IR). Most of the current systems are based on traditional models, which have been developed for atomic and independents documents and are not adapted to the Web. A promising research orientation consists of studying the impact of the Web structure on indexing. The HyperDocument model presented in this article is based on essential aspects of information comprehension: content, composition and linear/non-linear reading.
564454	Document normalization revisited Cosine Pivoted Document Length Normalization has reached a point of stability where many researchers indiscriminately apply a specific value of 0.2 regardless of the collection. Our efforts, however, demonstrate that applying this specific value without tuning for the document collection degrades average precision by as much as 20%.
564455	User-centered interface design for cross-language information retrieval This paper reports on the user-centered design methodology and techniques used for the elicitation of user requirements and how these requirements informed the first phase of the user interface design for a Cross-Language Information Retrieval System. We describe a set of factors involved in analysis of the data collected and, finally discuss the implications for user interface design based on the findings.

564458	A visualisation tool for topic tracking analysis and development Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) research explores the development of algorithms to detect novel events and track their development over time for online reports. Development of these methods requires careful evaluation and analysis. Traditional reductive methods of evaluation only represent some of the available information of algorithm behaviour. We describe a visualisation tool for topic tracking which makes it easy to analysis and compare the temporal behaviour of tracking algorithms.
564459	A new method of parameter estimation for multinomial naive bayes text classifiers Multinomial naive Bayes classifiers have been widely used for the probabilistic text classification. However, their parameter estimation method sometimes generates inappropriate probabilities. In this paper, we propose a topic document model approach for naive Bayes text classification, where their parameters are estimated with an expectation from the training documents. Experiments are conducted on Reuters 21578 and 20 Newsgroup collection, and our proposed approach obtained a significant improvement in performace over the conventional approach.
564460	Study of category score algorithms for k-NN classifier We analyzes category score algorithms for k-NN classifier found in the literature, including majority voting algorithm ( MVA ), simple sum algorithm ( SSA ). MVA and SSA are two mainly used algorithms to estimate score for candidate categories in k-NN classifier systems. Based on the hypothesis that utilization of internal relation between documents and categories could improve system performance, two new weighting score models: concept-based weighting ( CBW ) score model and term independence-based weighting ( IBW ) score model are proposed. Our experimental results confirm our hypothesis and show that in the term of precision average IBW and CBW are better than the other score models, while SSA is higher than MVA . According to macro-average F1 CBW performs best. Rocchio-based algorithm ( RBA ) always performs worst.
564461	Higher precision for two-word queries Queries have specific properties, and may need individualized methods and parameters to optimize retrieval. Length is one property. We look at how two-word queries may attain higher precision by re-ranking using word co-occurrence evidence in retrieved documents. Co-occurrence within document context is not sufficient, but window context including sentence context evidence can provide precision improvements at low recall region of 4 to 10% using initial retrieval results, and positively affects pseudo-relevance feedback.

564463	A logistic regression approach to distributed IR This poster session examines a probabilistic approach to distributed information retrieval using a Logistic Regression algorithm for estimation of collection relevance. The algorithm is compared to other methods for distributed search using test collections developed for distributed search evaluation.
564464	Automatic metadata generation & evaluation The poster reports on a project in which we are investigating methods for breaking the human metadata-generation bottleneck that plagues Digital Libraries. The research question is whether metadata elements and values can be automatically generated from the content of educational resources, and correctly assigned to mathematics and science educational materials. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques were implemented to automatically assign values of the GEMgenerate metadata element set tofor learning resources provided by the Gateway for Education (GEM), a service that offers web access to a wide range of educational materials. In a user study, education professionals evaluated the metadata assigned to learning resources by either automatic tagging or manual assignment. Results show minimal difference in the eyes of the evaluators between automatically generated metadata and manually assigned metadata.
564465	A critical examination of TDT's cost function Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) tasks are evaluated using a cost function. The standard TDT cost function assumes a constant probability of relevance P (rel) across all topics. In practice, P (rel) varies widely across topics. We argue using both theoretical and experimental evidence that the cost function should be modified to account for the varying P (rel).
564466	Converting on-line bilingual dictionaries from human-readable to machine-readable form We describe a language called ABET that allows rapid conversion of on-line human-readable bilingual dictionaries to machine-readable form.
564467	Modeling (in)variability of human judgments for text summarization The paper proposes and empirically motivates an integration of supervised learning with unsupervised learning to deal with human biases in summarization. In particular, we explore the use of probabilistic decision tree within the clustering framework to account for the variation as well as regularity in human created summaries.
564468	Content-based music indexing and organization While electronic music archives are gaining popularity, access to and navigation within these archives is usually limited to text-based queries or manually predefined genre category browsing. We present a system that automatically organizes a music collection according to the perceived sound similarity resembling genres or styles of music. Audio signals are processed according to psychoacoustic models to obtain a time-invariant representation of its characteristics. Subsequent clustering provides an intuitive interface where similar pieces of music are grouped together on a map display.

564470	Experiments on data fusion using headline information This poster describes initial work exploring a relatively unexamined area of data fusion: fusing the results of retrieval systems whose collections have no overlap between them. Many of the effective meta-search/data fusion strategies gain much of their success from exploiting document overlap across the source systems being merged. When the intersection of the collections is the empty set, the strategies generally degrade to a simpler form. In order to address such situations, two strategies were examined: re-ranking of merged results using a locally run search on the text fragments returned by the source search engines; and re-ranking based on cross document similarity, again using text fragments presented in the retrieved list. Results, from experiments, which go beyond previous work, indicate that both strategies improve fusion effectiveness.
564471	Building thematic lexical resources by term categorization We discuss the automatic generation of thematic lexicons by means of term categorization , a novel task employing techniques from information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). Specifically, we view the generation of such lexicons as an iterative process of learning previously unknown associations between terms and themes (i.e. disciplines, or fields of activity). The process is iterative, in that it generates, for each c i in a set C = {c 1 ,...,c m } of themes, a sequence L i 0 ? L i 1 ? ... ? L i n of lexicons, bootstrapping from an initial lexicon L i 0 and a set of text corpora &THgr; = {&thgr; 0 ,...,&thgr; n-1 } given as input. The method is inspired by text categorization , the discipline concerned with labelling natural language texts with labels from a predefined set of themes, or categories. However, while text categorization deals with documents represented as vectors in a space of terms, term categorization deals (dually) with terms represented as vectors in a space of documents, and labels terms (instead of documents) with themes. As a learning device we adopt boosting , since (a) it has demonstrated state-of-the-art effectiveness in a variety of text categorization applications, and (b) it naturally allows for a form of "data cleaning", thereby making the process of generating a thematic lexicon an iteration of generate-and-test steps.
564472	Topic structure modeling In this paper, we present a method based on document probes to quantify and diagnose topic structure, distinguishing topics as monolithic, structured, or diffuse. The method also yields a structure analysis that can be used directly to optimize filter (classifier) creation. Preliminary results illustrate the predictive value of the approach on TREC/Reuters-96 topics.
564473	Language model for IR using collection information Information retrieval using meta data can be traced back to the early age of IR where documents are represented by the controlled vocabulary. In this paper, we explore the usage of meta-data information under the framework of language model. We present a new language model that is able to take advantage of the category information for documents to improve the retrieval accuracy. We compare the new language model with the traditional language model over the TREC4 dataset where the collection information for documents is obtained using the k-means clustering method. The new language model outperforms the traditional language model, which verifies our statement.
564474	Automatic evaluation of world wide web search services Users of the World-Wide Web are not only confronted by an immense overabundance of information, but also by a plethora of tools for searching for the web pages that suit their information needs. Web search engines differ widely in interface, features, coverage of the web, ranking methods, delivery of advertising, and more. In this paper, we present a method for comparing search engines automatically based on how they rank known item search results. Because the engines perform their search on overlapping (but different) subsets of the web collected at different points in time, evaluation of search engines poses significant challenges to the traditional information retrieval methodology. Our method uses known item searching; comparing the relative ranks of the items in the search engines' rankings. Our approach automatically constructs known item queries using query log analysis and automatically constructs the result via analysis of editor comments from the ODP (Open Directory Project). Additionally, we present our comparison on five (Lycos, Netscape, Fast, Google, HotBot) well-known search services and find that some services perform known item searches better than others, but the majority are statistically equivalent.
564475	Does WT10g look like the web? We measure the WT10g test collection, used in the TREC-9 and TREC 2001 Web Tracks, with common measures used in the web topology community, in order to see if WT10g "looks like" the web. This is not an idle question; characteristics of the web, such as power law relationships, diameter, and connected components have all been observed within the scope of general web crawls, constructed by blindly following links. In contrast, WT10g was carved out from a larger crawl specifically to be a web search test collection within the reach of university researchers. Does such a collection retain the properties of the larger web? In the case of WT10g, yes.

564477	Selecting indexing strings using adaptation It is not easy to tokenize agglutinative languages like Japanese and Chinese into words. Many IR systems start with a dictionary-based morphology program like ChaSen [4]. Unfortunately, dictionaries cannot cover all possible words; unknown words such as proper nouns are important for IR. This paper proposes a statistical dictionary-free method for selecting index strings based on recent work on adaptive language modeling.
564478	Error correction in a Chinese OCR test collection This article proposes a technique for correcting Chinese OCR errors to support retrieval of scanned documents. The technique uses a completely automatic technique (no manually constructed lexicons or confusion resources) to identify both keywords and confusable terms. Improved retrieval effectiveness on a single term query experiment is demonstrated.

564480	K-tree/forest: efficient indexes for boolean queries In Information Retrieval it is well-known that the complexity of processing boolean queries depends on the size of the intermediate results, which could be huge (and are typically on disk) even though the size of the final result may be quite small. In the case of inverted files the most time consuming operation is the merging or intersection of the list of occurrences [1]. We propose, the Keyword tree (K-tree) and forest, efficient structures to handle boolean queries in keyword-based information retrieval. Extensive simulations show that K-tree is orders-of-magnitude faster (i.e., far fewer I/O's) for boolean queries than the usual approach of merging the lists of occurrences and incurs only a small overhead for single keyword queries. The K-tree can be efficiently parallelized as well. The construction cost of K-tree is comparable to the cost of building inverted files.
564481	Example-based phrase translation in Chinese-English CLIR This paper proposes an example-based phrase translation method in a Chinese to English cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) system. The method can generate much more accurate query translations than dictionary-based and common MT-based methods, and then improves the retrieval performance of our CLIR system.
564482	Probabilistic multimedia retrieval We present a framework in which probabilistic models for textual and visual information retrieval can be integrated seamlessly. The framework facilitates searching for imagery using textual descriptions and visual examples simultaneously. The underlying Language Models for text and Gaussian Mixture Models for images have proven successful in various retrieval tasks.
564483	Chinese keyword extraction based on max-duplicated strings of the documents The corpus analysis methods in Chinese keyword extraction look on the corpus as a single sample of language stochastic process. But the distributions of keywords in the whole corpus and in each document are very different from each other. The extraction based on global statistical information only can get significant keywords in the whole corpus. Max-duplicated strings contain the local significant keywords in each document. In this paper, we designed an efficient algorithm to extract the max-duplicated strings by building PAT-tree for the document, so that the keywords can be picked out from the max-duplicated strings by their SIG values in the corpus.

564485	Correlating multilingual documents via bipartite graph modeling There is enormous amount of multilingual documents from various sources and possibly from different countries describing a single event or a set of related events. It is desirable to construct text mining methods that can compare and highlight similarities and differences of those multilingual documents. We discuss our ongoing research that seeks to model a pair of multilingual documents as a weighted bipartite graph with the edge weights computed by means of machine translation. We use spectral method to identify dense subgraphs of the weighted bipartite graph which can be considered as corresponding to sentences that correlate well in textual contents. We illustrate our approach using English and German texts.
564487	A system using implicit feedback and top ranking sentences to help users find relevant web documents We present a web search interface designed to encourage users to interact more fully with the results of a web search. Wrapping around a major commercial search engine, the system combines three main features; real-time query-biased web document summarisation, the presentation of sentences highly relevant to the searcher's query, and evidence captured from searcher interaction with the retrieval results.
564488	Indexing, searching, and retrieving of recorded live presentations with the AOF (authoring on the fly) search engine The tremendous amount of data resulting from the regular usage of tools for automatic presentation recording demand for elaborate search functionality. A detailed analysis of the according multimedia documents is required to allow search at a very detailed level. Unfortunately, the produced data differs significantly from traditional documents. In this demo, we discuss the problems appearing in the presentation retrieval scenario and introduce aofSE, a search engine to study and illustrate these problems as well as to develop and present according solutions and new approaches for this task.

564491	Query performance analyser -: a web-based tool for IR research and instruction The Interactive Query Performance Analyser (QPA) for information retrieval systems is a Web-based tool for analysing and comparing the performance of individual queries. On top of a standard test collection, it gives an instant visualisation of the performance achieved in a given search topic by any user-generated query. In addition to experimental IR research, QPA can be used in user training to demonstrate the characteristics of and compare differences between IR systems and searching strategies. The first prototype (versions 3.0 and 3.5) of the Query Performance Analyser was developed at the Department of Information Studies, University of Tampere, to serve as a tool for rapid query performance analysis, comparison and visualisation [4,5]. Later, it has been applied to interactive optimisation of queries [2,3]. The analyser has served also in learning environments for IR [1].The demonstration is based on the newest version of the Query Performance Analyser (v. 5.1). It is interfaced to a traditional Boolean IR system (TRIP) and a probabilistic IR system (Inquery) providing access to the TREC collection and two Finnish test collections. Version 5.1 supports multigraded relevance scales, new types of performance visualisations, and query conversions based on mono- and multi-lingual dictionaries. The motivation in developing the analyser is to emphasise the necessity of analysing the behaviour of individual queries. Information retrieval experiments usually measure the average effectiveness of IR methods developed. The analysis of individual queries is neglected although test results may contain individual test topics where general findings do not hold. For the real user of an IR system, the study of variation in results is even more important than averages.
564492	Adaptive information extraction for document annotation in amilcare Amilcare is a tool for Adaptive Information Extraction (IE) designed for supporting active annotation of documents for the Semantic Web (SW). It can be used either for unsupervised document annotation or as a support for human annotation. Amilcare is portable to new applications/domains without any knowledge of IE, as it just requires users to annotate a small training corpus with the information to be extracted. It is based on (LP)2, a supervised learning strategy for IE able to cope with different texts types, from newspaper-like texts, to rigidly formatted Web pages and even a mixture of them[1][5].Adaptation starts with the definition of a tag set for annotation, possibly organized as an ontology. Then users have to manually annotate a small training corpus. Amilcare provides a default mouse-based interface called Melita, where annotations are inserted by first selecting a tag from the ontology and then identifying the text area to annotate with the mouse. Differently from similar annotation tools [4, 5], Melita actively supports training corpus annotation. While users annotate texts, Amilcare runs in the background learning how to reproduce the inserted annotation. Induced rules are silently applied to new texts and their results are compared with the user annotation. When its rules reach a (user-defined) level of accuracy, Melita presents new texts with a preliminary annotation derived by the rule application. In this case users have just to correct mistakes and add missing annotations. User corrections are inputted back to the learner for retraining. This technique focuses the slow and expensive user activity on uncovered cases, avoiding requiring annotating cases where a satisfying effectiveness is already reached. Moreover validating extracted information is a much simpler task than tagging bare texts (and also less error prone), speeding up the process considerably. At the end of the corpus annotation process, the system is trained and the application can be delivered. MnM [6] and Ontomat annotizer [7] are two annotation tools adopting Amilcare's learner.In this demo we simulate the annotation of a small corpus and we show how and when Amilcare is able to support users in the annotation process, focusing on the way the user can control the tool's proactivity and intrusivity. We will also quantify such support with data derived from a number of experiments on corpora. We will focus on training corpus size and correctness of suggestions when the corpus is increased.

564494	Souvenir: flexible note-taking tool to pinpoint and share media highlights Digital media audio/video can be difficult to search and share in a personal way. Souvenir is a software system that offers users a flexible and comprehensive way to use their handwritten or text notes to retrieve and share specific media moments. Users can take notes on a variety of devices, such as the paper-based CrossPad, the Palm Pilot and standard keyboard devices. Souvenir segments handwritten notes into an effective media index without the need for handwriting recognition. Users can use their notes to create hyperlinks to random-access media stored in a digital library. Souvenir also has web publishing and email capabilities to enable anyone to access or email media moments directly from a web page. Souvenir annotations capture information that can not be easily inferred by automatic media indexing tools.
564495	Hierarchical approach to term suggestion device Our demonstration shows the hierarchy system working on a locally run search engine. Hierarchies are dynamically generated from the retrieved documents, and visualised on the menus. When a user selects a term from the hierarchy, the documents linked to the term are listed, and the term is then added to the initial query to rerun a search. Through the demonstration we illustrate how hierarchical presentation of expansion terms is achieved, and how our approach supports users to articulate their information needs using the hierarchy.

564498	CuTeX: a system for extracting data from text tables A wealth of information relevant for e-commerce often appears in text form. This includes specification and performance data sheets of products, financial statements, product offerings etc. Typically these types of product and financial data are published in tabular form. The only separators between items in the table are white spaces and line separators. We will refer to such tables as text tables . Due to the lack of structure in such tables, the information present is not readily queriable using traditional database query languages like SQL. One way to make it amenable to standard database querying techniques is to extract the data items in the tables and create a database out of the extracted data. But extraction from text tables poses difficulties due to the irregularity of the data in the column. Existing techniques like [1] and [3] are based on finding fixed separators between successive columns. However, it is not always possible to find fixed separators. Even if fixed separators exist they may not unambiguously separate columns that have multiword items. Another set of techniques are based on regular expressions. The problems here are: (i) they are difficult to construct and (ii) they depend on lexical similarity between column items. Note that, by visual inspection a casual observer can correctly associate every item in a text table to its corresponding column. This is because all the items belonging to a column appear "clustered" more closely to each other than to items in different columns. Whereas such clusters can be clearly discerned by a human observer, making them machine recognizable is the key to robust automated extraction of data items from text-based tables. Clustering enables us to make associations between items in a column based not merely on examining items in adjacent rows but across all the rows in the table. We have designed and implemented the CuteX system for extracting data from irregular text tables. The input is a file containing only text tables. The output produced by CuteX is an association between every items in a column. Note that CuteX does not do table detection in text. The innovative aspect of CuteX is its clustering-based algorithm that drives the extraction process. In CuteX each line is broken down into a set of tokens. Each token is a contiguous sequence of non white-space characters. The center of any token in a cluster is closer to the center of some other token in the same cluster. Inter-cluster gaps are gaps between the extremal tokens in the clusters. Starting with an initial set of clusters, adjacent clusters are merged into bigger clusters based on the inter-cluster gaps. The algorithm terminates when no more clusters can be merged. We have formalized the notion of a correct extraction and developed a syntactic characterization of tables on which this algorithm will always produce a correct extraction. Details appear in [2]. An unique aspect of the algorithm is its robustness in the presence of misalignments. Precision of extraction can be improved by supplying the minimum separation between columns as a parameter. Such a separator is estimated by sampling a few input tables. The clustering algorithm does not merge adjacent clusters if the gap between them is larger than this parameter value. Note though that the minimum column gap cannot be used as a fixed separator since doing so amounts to doing localized determination, making it brittle to misalignments. CuteX is implemented in Java and is approximately about 3000 lines of code. The system automatically partitions the set of input text tables into directories containing correct and incorrect extractions. At the end of an extraction, the user can examine the directory containing incorrectly extracted tables, sample a few of them, identify if it was caused by an erroneous estimate of the minimum column gap, re-adjust the configuration parameter and start a new extraction on all these tables. Successive iterations can generate a higher extraction yield. The primary focus of the demonstration will be on illustrating the robustness and the iterative process of improving the extraction yield of the clustering algorithm.
564499	YellowPager: a tool for ontology-based mining of service directories from web sources The web has established itself as the dominant medium for doing electronic commerce. Realizing that its global reach provides significant market and business opportunities, service providers, both large and small are advertising their services on the web. A number of them operate their own web sites promoting their services at length while others are merely listed in a referral site. Aggregating all of the providers into a queriable service directory makes it easy for customers to locate the one most suited for his/her needs. YellowPager is a tool for creating service directories by mining web sources. Service directories created by YellowPager have several merits compared to those generated by existing practices, which typically require participation by service providers (e.g. Verizon's SuperYellowPages.com). Firstly, the information content will be rich. Secondly since the process is automated and repeatable the content can always be kept current. Finally the same process can be readily adapted to different domains. YellowPager builds service directories by mining the web through a combination of keyword-based search engines,web agents, text classifiers and novel extraction algorithms.The extraction is driven by a services ontology consisting of a taxonomy of service concepts and their associated attributes (such as names and addresses) and type descriptions for the attributes. In addition the ontology also associates an extractor function with each attribute. Applying the function to a web page will identify all the occurrences of the attribute in that page. YellowPager 's mining algorithm consists of a training step followed by classification and extraction steps. In the training step a classifier is trained to identify web pages relevant to the service of interest. The classification step proceeds by doing a search for the particular service of interest using a keyword based web search engine and retrieves all the matching web pages. From these pages the relevant ones are identified using the classifier. The final step is extraction of attribute values, associated with the service, from these pages. Each web page is parsed into a DOM tree and the extractor functions are applied. All of the attributes corresponding to a service provider are then correctly aggregated. This can pose difficulties especially in the presence of multiple service providers in a page. Using a novel concept of scoring and conflict resolution to prevent erroneous associations of attributes with service provider entities in the page, the algorithm aggregates all the attribute occurrences correctly. The extractor function may not be complete in the sense that it cannot always identify all the attributes in a page. By exploiting the regularity of the sequence in which attributes occurr in referral pages, the mining algorithm automatically learns generalized patterns to locate attributes that the extractor function misses. The distinguishing aspects of YellowPager 's extraction algorithm are: (i) it is unsupervised, and (ii) the attribute values in the pages are extracted independent of any page-specific relationships that may exist among the markup tags. YellowPager has been used by a large pet food producer to build a directory of veterinarian service providers in the United States. The resulting database was found to be much larger and richer than that found in Vetquest, Vetworld, and the Super Yellow pages. YellowPager is implemented in JAVA and is interfaced to Rainbow, a library utility in C that is used for classification. The tool will demonstrate the creation of a service directory for any service domain by mining web sources.
860436	Keynote Address - exploring, modeling, and using the web graph The Web graph, meaning the graph induced by Web pages as nodes and their hyperlinks as directed edges, has become a fascinating object of study for many people: physicists, sociologists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and information retrieval specialists.Recent results range from theoretical (e.g.: models for the graph, semi-external algorithms), to experimental (e.g.: new insights regarding the rate of change of pages, new data on the distribution of degrees), to practical (e.g.: improvements in crawling technology).Recent results range from theoretical (e.g.: models for the graph, semi-external algorithms), to experimental (e.g.: new insights regarding the rate of change of pages, new data on the distribution of degrees), to practical (e.g.: improvements in crawling technology).The goal of this talk is to convey an introduction to the state of the art in this area and to sketch the current issues in collecting, representing, analyzing, and modeling this graph. Although graph analytic methods are essential tools in the Web IR arsenal, they are well known to the SIGIR community and will not be discussed here in any detail; instead, we will explore some challenges and opportunities for using IR methods and techniques in the exploration of the Web graph, in particular in dealing with legitimate and "spam" perturbations of the "natural" process of birth and death of nodes and links, and conversely, the challenges and opportunities of using graph methods in support of IR on the Web and in the enterprise.
860437	Salton Award Lecture - Information retrieval and computer science: an evolving relationship Following the tradition of these acceptance talks, I will be giving my thoughts on where our field is going. Any discussion of the future of information retrieval (IR) research, however, needs to be placed in the context of its history and relationship to other fields. Although IR has had a very strong relationship with library and information science, its relationship to computer science (CS) and its relative standing as a sub-discipline of CS has been more dynamic. IR is quite an old field, and when a number of CS departments were forming in the 60s, it was not uncommon for a faculty member to be pursuing research related to IR. Early ACM curriculum recommendations for CS contained courses on information retrieval, and encyclopedias described IR and database systems as different aspects of the same field. By the 70s, there were only a few IR researchers in CS departments in the U.S., database systems was a separate (and thriving) field, and many felt that IR had stagnated and was largely irrelevant. The truth, in fact, was far from that. The IR research community was a small, but dedicated, group of researchers in the U.S. and Europe who were motivated by a desire to understand the process of information retrieval and to build systems that would help people find the right information in text databases. This was (and is) a hard goal and led to different evaluation metrics and methodologies than the database community. Progress in the field was hampered by a lack of large-scale testbeds and tests were limited to databases containing at most a few hundred document abstracts. In the 80s AI boom, IR was still not a mainstream area, despite its focus on a human task involving natural language. IR focused on a statistical approach to language rather than the much more popular knowledge-based approach. The fact that IR conferences mix papers on effectiveness as measured by human judgments with papers measuring performance of file organizations for large-scale systems has meant that IR has always been difficult to classify into simple categories such as "systems" or "AI" that are often used in CS departments. Since the early 90s, just about everything has changed. Large, full-text databases were finally made available for experimentation through DARPA funding and TREC. This has had an enormous positive impact on the quantity and quality of IR research. The advent of the Web search engine has validated the longstanding claims made by IR researchers that simple queries and ranking were the right techniques for information access in a largely unstructured information world. What has not changed is that there are still relatively few IR researchers in CS departments. There are, however, many more people in CS departments doing IR-related research, which is just about the same thing. Conferences in databases, machine learning, computational linguistics, and data mining publish a number of IR papers done by people who would not primarily consider themselves as IR researchers. Given that there is an increasing diffusion of IR ideas into the CS community, it is worth stating what IR, as a field of CS, has accomplished: Search engines have become the infrastructure for much of information access in our society. IR has provided the basic research on the algorithms and data structures for these engines, and continues to develop new capabilities such as cross-lingual search, distributed search, question answering, and topic detection and tracking. IR championed the statistical approach to language long before it was accepted by other researchers working on language technologies. Statistical NLP is now mainstream and results from that field are being used to improve IR systems (in question answering, for example). IR focused on evaluation as a research area, and developed an evaluation methodology based on large, standardized testbeds and comparison with human judgments that has been adopted by researchers in a number of other language technology areas. IR, because of its focus on measuring success based on human judgments, has always acknowledged the importance of the user and interaction as a part of information access. This led to a number of contributions to the design of query and search interfaces and learning techniques based on user feedback. Although these achievements are important, the long-term goals of the IR field have not yet been met. What are those goals? One possibility that is often mentioned is the MEMEX of Vannevar Bush [1]. Another, more recent, statement of long-term challenges was made in the report of the IR Challenges Workshop [2]: Global Information Access: Satisfy human information needs through natural, efficient interaction with an automated system that leverages world-wide structured and unstructured data in any language. Contextual Retrieval; Combine search technologies and knowledge about query and user context into a single framework in order to provide the most appropriate answer for a user's information need. These goals are, in fact, very similar to long-term challenges coming out of other CS fields. For example, Jim Gray, a Turing Award winner from the database area, mentioned in his address a personal and world MEMEX as long-term goals for his field and CS in general [3]. IR's long-term goals are clearly important long-term goals for the whole of CS, and achieving those goals will involve everyone interested in the general area of information management and retrieval. Rather than talking about what IR can do in isolation to progress towards its goals, I would prefer to talk about what IR can do in collaboration with other areas. There are many examples of potential collaborative research areas. Collaborations with researchers from the NLP and information extraction communities have been developing for some time in order to study topics such as advanced question answering. On the other hand, not enough has been done to work with the database community to develop probabilistic retrieval models for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. There have been a number of attempts to combine IR and database functionality, none of which has been particularly successful. Most recently, some groups have been working on combining IR search with XML documents, but what is needed is a comprehensive examination of the issues and problems by teams from both areas working together, and the creation of new testbeds that can be used to evaluate proposed models. The time is right for such collaborations. Another example of where database, IR, and networking people can work together is in the development of distributed, heterogeneous information systems. This requires significant new research in areas like peer-to-peer architectures, semantic heterogeneity, automatic metadata generation, and retrieval models. If the information systems described above are extended to include new data types such as video, images, sound, and the whole range of scientific data (such as from the biosciences, geoscience, and astronomy), then a broad range of new challenges are added that need to be tackled in collaboration with people who know about these types of data. There should also be more cooperation between the data mining, IR, and summarization communities to tackle the core problem of defining what is new and interesting in streams of data. These and other similar collaborations will the basis for the future development of the IR field. We will continue to work on research problems that specifically interest us, but this research will increasingly be in the context of larger efforts. IR concepts and IR research will be an important part of the evolving mix of CS expertise that will be used to solve the "grand" challenges.
860439	Bayesian extension to the language model for ad hoc information retrieval We propose a Bayesian extension to the ad-hoc Language Model. Many smoothed estimators used for the multinomial query model in ad-hoc Language Models (including Laplace and Bayes-smoothing) are approximations to the Bayesian predictive distribution. In this paper we derive the full predictive distribution in a form amenable to implementation by classical IR models, and then compare it to other currently used estimators. In our experiments the proposed model outperforms Bayes-smoothing, and its combination with linear interpolation smoothing outperforms all other estimators.
860440	Beyond independent relevance: methods and evaluation metrics for subtopic retrieval We present a non-traditional retrieval problem we call subtopic retrieval . The subtopic retrieval problem is concerned with finding documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic. In such a problem, the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking, violating the assumption of independent relevance which is assumed in most traditional retrieval methods. Subtopic retrieval poses challenges for evaluating performance, as well as for developing effective algorithms. We propose a framework for evaluating subtopic retrieval which generalizes the traditional precision and recall metrics by accounting for intrinsic topic difficulty as well as redundancy in documents. We propose and systematically evaluate several methods for performing subtopic retrieval using statistical language models and a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) ranking strategy. A mixture model combined with query likelihood relevance ranking is shown to modestly outperform a baseline relevance ranking on a data set used in the TREC interactive track.
860441	Empirical development of an exponential probabilistic model for text retrieval: using textual analysis to build a better model Much work in information retrieval focuses on using a model of documents and queries to derive retrieval algorithms. Model based development is a useful alternative to heuristic development because in a model the assumptions are explicit and can be examined and refined independent of the particular retrieval algorithm. We explore the explicit assumptions underlying the naïve framework by performing computational analysis of actual corpora and queries to devise a generative document model that closely matches text. Our thesis is that a model so developed will be more accurate than existing models, and thus more useful in retrieval, as well as other applications. We test this by learning from a corpus the best document model. We find the learned model better predicts the existence of text data and has improved performance on certain IR tasks.
860443	Question classification using support vector machines Question classification is very important for question answering. This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine learning approaches. We have experimented with five machine learning algorithms: Nearest Neighbors (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using two kinds of features: bag-of-words and bag-of-ngrams. The experiment results show that with only surface text features the SVM outperforms the other four methods for this task. Further, we propose to use a special kernel function called the tree kernel to enable the SVM to take advantage of the syntactic structures of questions. We describe how the tree kernel can be computed efficiently by dynamic programming. The performance of our approach is promising, when tested on the questions from the TREC QA track.
860444	Structured use of external knowledge for event-based open domain question answering One of the major problems in question answering (QA) is that the queries are either too brief or often do not contain most relevant terms in the target corpus. In order to overcome this problem, our earlier work integrates external knowledge extracted from the Web and WordNet to perform Event-based QA on the TREC-11 task. This paper extends our approach to perform event-based QA by uncovering the structure within the external knowledge. The knowledge structure loosely models different facets of QA events, and is used in conjunction with successive constraint relaxation algorithm to achieve effective QA. Our results obtained on TREC-11 QA corpus indicate that the new approach is more effective and able to attain a confidence-weighted score of above 80%.
860445	Quantitative evaluation of passage retrieval algorithms for question answering Passage retrieval is an important component common to many question answering systems. Because most evaluations of question answering systems focus on end-to-end performance, comparison of common components becomes difficult. To address this shortcoming, we present a quantitative evaluation of various passage retrieval algorithms for question answering, implemented in a framework called Pauchok. We present three important findings: Boolean querying schemes perform well in the question answering task. The performance differences between various passage retrieval algorithms vary with the choice of document retriever, which suggests significant interactions between document retrieval and passage retrieval. The best algorithms in our evaluation employ density-based measures for scoring query terms. Our results reveal future directions for passage retrieval and question answering.
860447	Building a web thesaurus from web link structure Thesaurus has been widely used in many applications, including information retrieval, natural language processing, and question answering. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically constructing a domain-specific thesaurus from the Web using link structure information. The proposed approach is able to identify new terms and reflect the latest relationship between terms as the Web evolves. First, a set of high quality and representative websites of a specific domain is selected. After filtering out navigational links, link analysis is applied to each website to obtain its content structure. Finally, the thesaurus is constructed by merging the content structures of the selected websites. The experimental results on automatic query expansion based on our constructed thesaurus show 20% improvement in search precision compared to the baseline.
860448	Implicit link analysis for small web search Current Web search engines generally impose link analysis-based re-ranking on web-page retrieval. However, the same techniques, when applied directly to small web search such as intranet and site search, cannot achieve the same performance because their link structures are different from the global Web. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing implicit links by mining users' access patterns, and then apply a modified PageRank algorithm to re-rank web-pages for small web search. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms content-based method by 16%, explicit link-based PageRank by 20% and DirectHit by 14%, respectively.
860449	Query type classification for web document retrieval The heterogeneous Web exacerbates IR problems and short user queries make them worse. The contents of web documents are not enough to find good answer documents. Link information and URL information compensates for the insufficiencies of content information. However, static combination of multiple evidences may lower the retrieval performance. We need different strategies to find target documents according to a query type. We can classify user queries as three categories, the topic relevance task, the homepage finding task, and the service finding task. In this paper, a user query classification scheme is proposed. This scheme uses the difference of distribution, mutual information, the usage rate as anchor texts, and the POS information for the classification. After we classified a user query, we apply different algorithms and information for the better results. For the topic relevance task, we emphasize the content information, on the other hand, for the homepage finding task, we emphasize the Link information and the URL information. We could get the best performance when our proposed classification method with the OKAPI scoring algorithm was used.
860451	Stuff I've seen: a system for personal information retrieval and re-use Most information retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate information discovery. However, much knowledge work involves finding and re-using previously seen information. We describe the design and evaluation of a system, called Stuff I've Seen (SIS) , that facilitates information re-use. This is accomplished in two ways. First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation.
860452	Search strategies in content-based image retrieval This paper describes two studies that looked at users' ability to formulate visual queries with a Content-Based Image Retrieval system that uses dominant image colour as the primary indexing key. The first experiment examined users' performance with two visual search tools, a sketch tool and a structured browsing tool, with different types of image query. The results showed that while users were able to successfully search on the basis of colour, and were able to formulate visual queries, their ability to do so was affected by search task type. Search task type was also shown to be related to search tool choice. However, the results of study two showed that while users were able to complete all of the tasks, there was evidence to suggest that a degree of compromise was present in the users' choice of image that was largely due to problems relating to query formulation.
860453	Using terminological feedback for web search refinement: a log-based study Although interactive query reformulation has been actively studied in the laboratory, little is known about the actual behavior of web searchers who are offered terminological feedback along with their search results. We analyze log sessions for two groups of users interacting with variants of the AltaVista search engine - a baseline group given no terminological feedback and a feedback group to whom twelve refinement terms are offered along with the search results. We examine uptake, refinement effectiveness, conditions of use, and refinement type preferences. Although our measure of overall session "success" shows no difference between outcomes for the two groups, we find evidence that a subset of those users presented with terminological feedback do make effective use of it on a continuing basis.
860455	A scalability analysis of classifiers in text categorization Real-world applications of text categorization often require a system to deal with tens of thousands of categories defined over a large taxonomy. This paper addresses the problem with respect to a set of popular algorithms in text categorization, including Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, ridge regression, linear least square fit and logistic regression. By providing a formal analysis of the computational complexity of each classification method, followed by an investigation on the usage of different classifiers in a hierarchical setting of categorization, we show how the scalability of a method depends on the topology of the hierarchy and the category distributions. In addition, we are able to obtain tight bounds for the complexities by using the power law to approximate category distributions over a hierarchy. Experiments with kNN and SVM classifiers on the OHSUMED corpus are reported on, as concrete examples.
860456	A repetition based measure for verification of text collections and for text categorization We suggest a way for locating duplicates and plagiarisms in a text collection using an R-measure , which is the normalized sum of the lengths of all suffixes of the text repeated in other documents of the collection. The R-measure can be effectively computed using the suffix array data structure. Additionally, the computation procedure can be improved to locate the sets of duplicate or plagiarised documents. We applied the technique to several standard text collections and found that they contained a significant number of duplicate and plagiarised documents. Another reformulation of the method leads to an algorithm that can be applied to supervised multi-class categorization. We illustrate the approach using the recently available Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1). The results show that the method outperforms SVM at multi-class categorization, and interestingly, that results correlate strongly with compression-based methods.
860457	Using asymmetric distributions to improve text classifier probability estimates Text classifiers that give probability estimates are more readily applicable in a variety of scenarios. For example, rather than choosing one set decision threshold, they can be used in a Bayesian risk model to issue a run-time decision which minimizes a user-specified cost function dynamically chosen at prediction time. However, the quality of the probability estimates is crucial. We review a variety of standard approaches to converting scores (and poor probability estimates) from text classifiers to high quality estimates and introduce new models motivated by the intuition that the empirical score distribution for the "extremely irrelevant", "hard to discriminate", and "obviously relevant" items are often significantly different. Finally, we analyze the experimental performance of these models over the outputs of two text classifiers. The analysis demonstrates that one of these models is theoretically attractive (introducing few new parameters while increasing flexibility), computationally efficient, and empirically preferable.
860459	Automatic image annotation and retrieval using cross-media relevance models Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing and then later retrieving their image collections. However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval.
860460	Modeling annotated data We consider the problem of modeling annotated data---data with multiple types where the instance of one type (such as a caption) serves as a description of the other type (such as an image). We describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture models which aim to describe such data, culminating in correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation , a latent variable model that is effective at modeling the joint distribution of both types and the conditional distribution of the annotation given the primary type. We conduct experiments on the Corel database of images and captions, assessing performance in terms of held-out likelihood, automatic annotation, and text-based image retrieval.
860461	Experimental result analysis for a generative probabilistic image retrieval model The main conclusion from the metrics-based evaluation of video retrieval systems at TREC's video track is that non-interactive image retrieval from general collections using visual information only is not yet feasible. We show how a detailed analysis of retrieval results -- looking beyond mean average precision (MAP) scores on topical relevance -- gives significant insight in the main problems with the visual part of the retrieval model under study. Such an analytical approach proves an important addition to standard evaluation measures.
860463	Combining document representations for known-item search This paper investigates the pre-conditions for successful combination of document representations formed from structural markup for the task of known-item search. As this task is very similar to work in meta-search and data fusion, we adapt several hypotheses from those research areas and investigate them in this context. To investigate these hypotheses, we present a mixture-based language model and also examine many of the current meta-search algorithms. We find that compatible output from systems is important for successful combination of document representations. We also demonstrate that combining low performing document representations can improve performance, but not consistently. We find that the techniques best suited for this task are robust to the inclusion of poorly performing document representations. We also explore the role of variance of results across systems and its impact on the performance of fusion, with the surprising result that the correct documents have higher variance across document representations than highly ranking incorrect documents.
860464	Searching XML documents via XML fragments Most of the work on XML query and search has stemmed from the publishing and database communities, mostly for the needs of business applications. Recently, the Information Retrieval community began investigating the XML search issue to answer information discovery needs. Following this trend, we present here an approach where information needs can be expressed in an approximate manner as pieces of XML documents or "XML fragments" of the same nature as the documents that are being searched. We present an extension of the vector space model for searching XML collections via XML fragments and ranking results by relevance. We describe how we have extended a full-text search engine to comply with this model. The value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high precision of our system, which was among the top performers in the recent INEX workshop. Our results indicate that certain queries are more appropriate than others for the extended vector space model. Specifically, queries with relatively specific contexts but vague information needs are best situated to reap the benefit of this model. Finally our results show that one method may not fit all types of queries and that it could be worthwhile to use different solutions for different applications.
860466	Word sense disambiguation in information retrieval revisited Word sense ambiguity is recognized as having a detrimental effect on the precision of information retrieval systems in general and web search systems in particular, due to the sparse nature of the queries involved. Despite continued research into the application of automated word sense disambiguation, the question remains as to whether less than 90% accurate automated word sense disambiguation can lead to improvements in retrieval effectiveness. In this study we explore the development and subsequent evaluation of a statistical word sense disambiguation system which demonstrates increased precision from a sense based vector space retrieval model over traditional TF*IDF techniques.
860467	Probabilistic term variant generator for biomedical terms This paper presents an algorithm to generate possible variants for biomedical terms. The algorithm gives each variant its generation probability representing its plausibility, which is potentially useful for query and dictionary expansions. The probabilistic rules for generating variants are automatically learned from raw texts using an existing abbreviation extraction technique. Our method, therefore, requires no linguistic knowledge or labor-intensive natural language resource. We conducted an experiment using 83,142 MEDLINE abstracts for rule induction and 18,930 abstracts for testing. The results indicate that our method will significantly increase the number of retrieved documents for long biomedical terms.
860469	A maximal figure-of-merit learning approach to text categorization A novel maximal figure-of-merit (MFoM) learning approach to text categorization is proposed. Different from the conventional techniques, the proposed MFoM method attempts to integrate any performance metric of interest (e.g. accuracy, recall, precision, or F1 measure) into the design of any classifier. The corresponding classifier parameters are learned by optimizing an overall objective function of interest. To solve this highly nonlinear optimization problem, we use a generalized probabilistic descent algorithm. The MFoM learning framework is evaluated on the Reuters-21578 task with LSI-based feature extraction and a binary tree classifier. Experimental results indicate that the MFoM classifier gives improved F1 and enhanced robustness over the conventional one. It also outperforms the popular SVM method in micro-averaging F1. Other extensions to design discriminative multiple-category MFoM classifiers for application scenarios with new performance metrics could be envisioned too.
860470	Text categorization by boosting automatically extracted concepts Term-based representations of documents have found wide-spread use in information retrieval. However, one of the main shortcomings of such methods is that they largely disregard lexical semantics and, as a consequence, are not sufficiently robust with respect to variations in word usage.In this paper we investigate the use of concept-based document representations to supplement word- or phrase-based features. The utilized concepts are automatically extracted from documents via probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We propose to use AdaBoost to optimally combine weak hypotheses based on both types of features. Experimental results on standard benchmarks confirm the validity of our approach, showing that AdaBoost achieves consistent improvements by including additional semantic features in the learned ensemble.
860471	Robustness of regularized linear classification methods in text categorization Real-world applications often require the classification of documents under situations of small number of features, mis-labeled documents and rare positive examples. This paper investigates the robustness of three regularized linear classification methods (SVM, ridge regression and logistic regression) under above situations. We compare these methods in terms of their loss functions and score distributions, and establish the connection between their optimization problems and generalization error bounds. Several sets of controlled experiments on the Reuters-21578 corpus are conducted to investigate the robustness of these methods. Our results show that ridge regression seems to be the most promising candidate for rare class problems.
860473	Building and applying a concept hierarchy representation of a user profile Term dependence is a natural consequence of language use. Its successful representation has been a long standing goal for Information Retrieval research. We present a methodology for the construction of a concept hierarchy that takes into account the three basic dimensions of term dependence. We also introduce a document evaluation function that allows the use of the concept hierarchy as a user profile for Information Filtering. Initial experimental results indicate that this is a promising approach for incorporating term dependence in the way documents are filtered.
860474	Query length in interactive information retrieval Query length in best-match information retrieval (IR) systems is well known to be positively related to effectiveness in the IR task, when measured in experimental, non-interactive environments. However, in operational, interactive IR systems, query length is quite typically very short, on the order of two to three words. We report on a study which tested the effectiveness of a particular query elicitation technique in increasing initial searcher query length, and which tested the effectiveness of queries elicited using this technique, and the relationship in general between query length and search effectiveness in interactive IR. Results show that the specific technique results in longer queries than a standard query elicitation technique, that this technique is indeed usable, that the technique results in increased user satisfaction with the search, and that query length is positively correlated with user satisfaction with the search.
860475	Re-examining the potential effectiveness of interactive query expansion Much attention has been paid to the relative effectiveness of interactive query expansion versus automatic query expansion. Although interactive query expansion has the potential to be an effective means of improving a search, in this paper we show that, on average, human searchers are less likely than systems to make good expansion decisions. To enable good expansion decisions, searchers must have adequate instructions on how to use interactive query expansion functionalities. We show that simple instructions on using interactive query expansion do not necessarily help searchers make good expansion decisions and discuss difficulties found in making query expansion decisions.
860477	Latent concepts and the number orthogonal factors in latent semantic analysis We seek insight into Latent Semantic Indexing by establishing a method to identify the optimal number of factors in the reduced matrix for representing a keyword. This method is demonstrated empirically by duplicating all documents containing a term t , and inserting new documents in the database that replace t with t' . By examining the number of times term t is identified for a search on term t' (precision) using differing ranges of dimensions, we find that lower ranked dimensions identify related terms and higher-ranked dimensions discriminate between the synonyms.
860478	A frequency-based and a poisson-based definition of the probability of being informative This paper reports on theoretical investigations about the assumptions underlying the inverse document frequency ( idf ). We show that an intuitive idf -based probability function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events. By assuming documents to be independent rather than disjoint, we arrive at a Poisson-based probability of being informative. The framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter estimation and combination in probabilistic retrieval models.
860479	Table extraction using conditional random fields The ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks. Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells.
860481	Building a filtering test collection for TREC 2002 Test collections for the filtering track in TREC have typically used either past sets of relevance judgments, or categorized collections such as Reuters Corpus Volume 1 or OHSUMED, because filtering systems need relevance judgments during the experiment for training and adaptation. For TREC 2002, we constructed an entirely new set of search topics for the Reuters Corpus for measuring filtering systems. Our method for building the topics involved multiple iterations of feedback from assessors, and fusion of results from multiple search systems using different search algorithms. We also developed a second set of "inexpensive" topics based on categories in the document collection. We found that the initial judgments made for the experiment were sufficient; subsequent pooled judging changed system rankings very little. We also found that systems performed very differently on the category topics than on the assessor-built topics.
860482	An empirical study on retrieval models for different document genres: patents and newspaper articles Reflecting the rapid growth in the utilization of large test collections for information retrieval since the 1990s, extensive comparative experiments have been performed to explore the effectiveness of various retrieval models. However, most collections were intended for retrieving newspaper articles and technical abstracts. In this paper, we describe the process of producing a test collection for patent retrieval, the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection, which includes two years of Japanese patent applications and 31 topics produced by professional patent searchers. We also report experimental results obtained by using this collection to re-examine the effectiveness of existing retrieval models in the context of patent retrieval. The relative superiority among existing retrieval models did not significantly differ depending on the document genre, that is, patents and newspaper articles. Issues related to patent retrieval are also discussed.
860483	Collaborative filtering via gaussian probabilistic latent semantic analysis Collaborative filtering aims at learning predictive models of user preferences, interests or behavior from community data, i.e. a database of available user preferences. In this paper, we describe a new model-based algorithm designed for this task, which is based on a generalization of probabilistic latent semantic analysis to continuous-valued response variables. More specifically, we assume that the observed user ratings can be modeled as a mixture of user communities or interest groups, where users may participate probabilistically in one or more groups. Each community is characterized by a Gaussian distribution on the normalized ratings for each item. The normalization of ratings is performed in a user-specific manner to account for variations in absolute shift and variance of ratings. Experiments on the EachMovie data set show that the proposed approach compares favorably with other collaborative filtering techniques.
860485	Document clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization In this paper, we propose a novel document clustering method based on the non-negative factorization of the term-document matrix of the given document corpus. In the latent semantic space derived by the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), each axis captures the base topic of a particular document cluster, and each document is represented as an additive combination of the base topics. The cluster membership of each document can be easily determined by finding the base topic (the axis) with which the document has the largest projection value. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering method surpasses the latent semantic indexing and the spectral clustering methods not only in the easy and reliable derivation of document clustering results, but also in document clustering accuracies.
860486	ReCoM: reinforcement clustering of multi-type interrelated data objects Most existing clustering algorithms cluster highly related data objects such as Web pages and Web users separately. The interrelation among different types of data objects is either not considered, or represented by a static feature space and treated in the same ways as other attributes of the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach for clustering multi-type interrelated data objects, ReCoM (Reinforcement Clustering of Multi-type Interrelated data objects). Under this approach, relationships among data objects are used to improve the cluster quality of interrelated data objects through an iterative reinforcement clustering process. At the same time, the link structure derived from relationships of the interrelated data objects is used to differentiate the importance of objects and the learned importance is also used in the clustering process to further improve the clustering results. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only effectively overcomes the problem of data sparseness caused by the high dimensional relationship space but also significantly improves the clustering accuracy.
860487	A comparative study on content-based music genre classification Content-based music genre classification is a fundamental component of music information retrieval systems and has been gaining importance and enjoying a growing amount of attention with the emergence of digital music on the Internet. Currently little work has been done on automatic music genre classification, and in addition, the reported classification accuracies are relatively low. This paper proposes a new feature extraction method for music genre classification, DWCHs . DWCHs stands for Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms. DWCHs capture the local and global information of music signals simultaneously by computing histograms on their Daubechies wavelet coefficients. Effectiveness of this new feature and of previously studied features are compared using various machine learning classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines and Linear Discriminant Analysis. It is demonstrated that the use of DWCHs significantly improves the accuracy of music genre classification.
860489	Evaluating different methods of estimating retrieval quality for resource selection In a federated digital library system, it is too expensive to query every accessible library. Resource selection is the task to decide to which libraries a query should be routed. Most existing resource selection algorithms compute a library ranking in a heuristic way. In contrast, the decision-theoretic framework (DTF) follows a different approach on a better theoretic foundation: It computes a selection which minimises the overall costs (e.g. retrieval quality, time, money) of the distributed retrieval. For estimating retrieval quality the recall-precision function is proposed. In this paper, we introduce two new methods: The first one computes the empirical distribution of the probabilities of relevance from a small library sample, and assumes it to be representative for the whole library. The second method assumes that the indexing weights follow a normal distribution, leading to a normal distribution for the document scores. Furthermore, we present the first evaluation of DTF by comparing this theoretical approach with the heuristical state-of-the-art system CORI; here we find that DTF outperforms CORI in most cases.
860490	Relevant document distribution estimation method for resource selection Prior research under a variety of conditions has shown the CORI algorithm to be one of the most effective resource selection algorithms, but the range of database sizes studied was not large. This paper shows that the CORI algorithm does not do well in environments with a mix of "small" and "very large" databases. A new resource selection algorithm is proposed that uses information about database sizes as well as database contents. We also show how to acquire database size estimates in uncooperative environments as an extension of the query-based sampling used to acquire resource descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the database size estimates are more accurate for large databases than estimates produced by a competing method; the new resource ranking algorithm is always at least as effective as the CORI algorithm; and the new algorithm results in better document rankings than the CORI algorithm.
860491	SETS: search enhanced by topic segmentation We present SETS , an architecture for efficient search in peer-to-peer networks, building upon ideas drawn from machine learning and social network theory. The key idea is to arrange participating sites in a topic-segmented overlay topology in which most connections are short-distance , connecting pairs of sites with similar content. Topically focused sets of sites are then joined together into a single network by long-distance links. Queries are matched and routed to only the topically closest regions. We discuss a variety of design issues and tradeoffs that an implementor of SETS would face. We show that SETS is efficient in network traffic and query processing load.
860493	Retrieval and novelty detection at the sentence level Previous research in novelty detection has focused on the task of finding novel material, given a set or stream of documents on a certain topic. This study investigates the more difficult two-part task defined by the TREC 2002 novelty track: given a topic and a group of documents relevant to that topic, 1) find the relevant sentences from the documents, and 2) find the novel sentences from the collection of relevant sentences. Our research shows that the former step appears to be the more difficult part of this task, and that the performance of novelty measures is very sensitive to the presence of non-relevant sentences.
860494	Domain-independent text segmentation using anisotropic diffusion and dynamic programming This paper presents a novel domain-independent text segmentation method, which identifies the boundaries of topic changes in long text documents and/or text streams. The method consists of three components: As a preprocessing step, we eliminate the document-dependent stop words as well as the generic stop words before the sentence similarity is computed. This step assists in the discrimination of the sentence semantic information. Then the cohesion information of sentences in a document or a text stream is captured with a sentence-distance matrix with each entry corresponding to the similarity between a sentence pair. The distance matrix can be represented with a gray-scale image. Thus, a text segmentation problem is converted into an image segmentation problem. We apply the anisotropic diffusion technique to the image representation of the distance matrix to enhance the semantic cohesion of sentence topical groups as well as sharpen topical boundaries. At last, the dynamic programming technique is adapted to find the optimal topical boundaries and provide a zoom-in and zoom-out mechanism for topics access by segmenting text in variable numbers of sentence topical groups. Our approach involves no domain-specific training, and it can be applied to texts in a variety of domains. The experimental results show that our approach is effective in text segmentation and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
860495	A System for new event detection We present a new method and system for performing the New Event Detection task, i.e., in one or multiple streams of news stories, all stories on a previously unseen (new) event are marked. The method is based on an incremental TF-IDF model. Our extensions include: generation of source-specific models, similarity score normalization based on document-specific averages, similarity score normalization based on source-pair specific averages, term reweighting based on inverse event frequencies, and segmentation of the documents. We also report on extensions that did not improve results. The system performs very well on TDT3 and TDT4 test data and scored second in the TDT-2002 evaluation.
860497	Probabilistic structured query methods Structured methods for query term replacement rely on separate estimates of term tes of replacement probabilities. Statistically significantfrequency and document frequency to compute a weight for each query term. This paper reviews prior work on structured query techniques and introduces three new variants that leverage estima improvements in retrieval effectiveness are demonstrated for cross-language retrieval and for retrieval based on optical character recognition when replacement probabilities are used to estimate both term frequency and document frequency.
860498	Fuzzy translation of cross-lingual spelling variants We will present a novel two-step fuzzy translation technique for cross-lingual spelling variants. In the first stage, transformation rules are applied to source words to render them more similar to their target language equivalents. The rules are generated automatically using translation dictionaries as source data. In the second stage, the intermediate forms obtained in the first stage are translated into a target language using fuzzy matching. The effectiveness of the technique was evaluated empirically using five source languages and English as a target language. The target word list contained 189 000 English words with the correct equivalents for the source words among them. The source words were translated using the two-step fuzzy translation technique, and the results were compared with those of plain fuzzy matching based translation. The combined technique performed better, sometimes considerably better, than fuzzy matching alone.
860499	Automatic transliteration for Japanese-to-English text retrieval For cross language information retrieval (CLIR) based on bilingual translation dictionaries, good performance depends upon lexical coverage in the dictionary. This is especially true for languages possessing few inter-language cognates, such as between Japanese and English. In this paper, we describe a method for automatically creating and validating candidate Japanese transliterated terms of English words. A phonetic English dictionary and a set of probabilistic mapping rules are used for automatically generating transliteration candidates. A monolingual Japanese corpus is then used for automatically validating the transliterated terms. We evaluate the usage of the extracted English-Japanese transliteration pairs with Japanese to English retrieval experiments over the CLEF bilingual test collections. The use of our automatically derived extension to a bilingual translation dictionary improves average precision, both before and after pseudo-relevance feedback, with gains ranging from 2.5% to 64.8%.
860501	On the effectiveness of evaluating retrieval systems in the absence of relevance judgments Soboroff, Nicholas and Cahan recently proposed a method for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems without relevance judgments. They demonstrated that the system evaluations produced by their methodology are correlated with actual evaluations using relevance judgments in the TREC competition. In this work, we propose an explanation for this phenomenon. We devise a simple measure for quantifying the similarity of retrieval systems by assessing the similarity of their retrieved results. Then, given a collection of retrieval systems and their retrieved results, we use this measure to assess the average similarity of a system to the other systems in the collection. We demonstrate that evaluating retrieval systems according to average similarity yields results quite similar to the methodology proposed by Soboroff et~al., and we further demonstrate that these two techniques are in fact highly correlated. Thus, the techniques are effectively evaluating and ranking retrieval systems by "popularity" as opposed to "performance.

860504	Toward a unification of text and link analysis This paper presents a simple yet profound idea. By thinking about the relationships between and within terms and documents, we can generate a richer representation that encompasses aspects of Web link analysis as well as text analysis techniques from information retrieval. This paper shows one path to this unified representation, and demonstrates the use of eigenvector calculations from Web link analysis by stepping through a simple example.
860505	Investigating the relationship between language model perplexity and IR precision-recall measures An empirical study has been conducted investigating the relationship between the performance of an aspect based language model in terms of perplexity and the corresponding information retrieval performance obtained. It is observed, on the corpora considered, that the perplexity of the language model has a systematic relationship with the achievable precision recall performance though it is not statistically significant.
860506	Topic distillation using hierarchy concept tree In this paper, we propose a new approach for topic distillation on World Wide Web. Topic distillation is to find quality documents related to the user query topic. Our approach is based on Bharat's topic distillation algorithm [1]. We present the analysis of hyperlink graph structure using hierarchy concept tree to solve the mixed hubs problem that is also remained in the Bharat's algorithm. For assigning better weights to hyperlinks which point to relevant documents among hyperlinks in a document, we try to find the relationship in documents connected by hyperlinks using content analysis and we assign weights to hyperlinks based on the relationship. We evaluated this algorithm using 50 topics on WT10g corpus and obtained improved results.
860507	Using manually-built web directories for automatic evaluation of known-item retrieval Information retrieval system evaluation is complicated by the need for manually assessed relevance judgments. Large manually-built directories on the web open the door to new evaluation procedures. By assuming that web pages are the known relevant items for queries that exactly match their title, we use the ODP (Open Directory Project) and Looksmart directories for system evaluation. We test our approach with a sample from a log of ten million web queries and show that such an evaluation is unbiased in terms of the directory used, stable with respect to the query set selected, and correlated with a reasonably large manual evaluation.

860509	Exploiting query history for document ranking in interactive information retrieval In this poster,we incorporate user query history, as context information, to improve the retrieval performance in interactive retrieval. Experiments using the TREC data show that incorporating such context information indeed consistently improves the retrieval performance in both average precision and precision at 20 documents.
860510	Automatic ranking of retrieval systems in imperfect environments The empirical investigation of the effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) systems requires a test collection, a set of query topics, and a set of relevance judgments made by human assessors for each query. Previous experiments show that differences in human relevance assessments do not affect the relative performance of retrieval systems. Based on this observation, we propose and evaluate a new approach to replace the human relevance judgments by an automatic method. Ranking of retrieval systems with our methodology correlates positively and significantly with that of human-based evaluations. In the experiments, we assume a Web-like imperfect environment: the indexing information for all documents is available for ranking, but some documents may not be available for retrieval. Such conditions can be due to document deletions or network problems. Our method of simulating imperfect environments can be used for Web search engine assessment and in estimating the effects of network conditions (e.g., network unreliability) on IR system performance.
860511	An investigation of broad coverage automatic pronoun resolution for information retrieval Term weighting methods have been shown to give significant increases in information retrieval performance. The presence of pronomial references in documents reduces the term frequencies of associated words with a consequent effect on term weights and information retrieval behaviour. This investigation explores the impact on information retrieval performance of broad coverage automatic pronoun resolution. Results indicate that this approach has potential to improve both precision at fixed cutoff levels and average precision.
860512	Syntactic features in question answering Syntactic information potentially plays a much more important role in question answering than it does in information retrieval. Although many people have used syntactic evidence in Question Answering, there haven't been many detailed experiments reported in the literature. The aim of the experiment described in this paper is to study the impact of a particular approach for using syntactic information on question answering effectiveness. Our results indicate that a combination of syntactic information with heuristics for ranking potential answers can perform better than the ranking heuristics on their own.
860513	Searchers' criteria For assessing web pages We investigate the criteria used by online searchers when assessing the relevance of web pages to information-seeking tasks. Twenty four searchers were given three tasks each, and indicated the features of web pages which they employed when deciding about the usefulness of the pages. These tasks were presented within the context of a simulated work-task situation. The results of this study provide a set of criteria used by searchers to decide about the utility of web pages. Such criteria have implications for the design of systems that use or recommend web pages, as well as to authors of web pages.
860514	When query expansion fails The effectiveness of queries in information retrieval can be improved through query expansion. This technique automatically introduces additional query terms that are statistically likely to match documents on the intended topic. However, query expansion techniques rely on fixed parameters. Our investigation of the effect of varying these parameters shows that the strategy of using fixed values is questionable.

860516	Fractal summarization: summarization based on fractal theory In this paper, we introduce the fractal summarization model based on the fractal theory. In fractal summarization, the important information is captured from the source text by exploring the hierarchical structure and salient features of the document. A condensed version of the document that is informatively close to the original is produced iteratively using the contractive transformation in the fractal theory. User evaluation has shown that fractal summarization outperforms traditional summarization.
860517	A unified model for metasearch and the efficient evaluation of retrieval systems via the hedge algorithm We present a unified framework for simultaneously solving both the pooling problem (the construction of efficient document pools for the evaluation of retrieval systems) and metasearch (the fusion of ranked lists returned by retrieval systems in order to increase performance). The implementation is based on the Hedge algorithm for online learning, which has the advantage of convergence to bounded error rates approaching the performance of the best linear combination of the underlying systems. The choice of a loss function closely related to the average precision measure of system performance ensures that the judged document set performs well, both in constructing a metasearch list and as a pool for the accurate evaluation of retrieval systems. Our experimental results on TREC data demonstrate excellent performance in all measures---evaluation of systems, retrieval of relevant documents, and generation of metasearch lists.
860518	Statistical visual feature indexes in video retrieval Four statistical visual feature indexes are proposed: SLM (Shot Length Mean), the average length of each shot in a video; SLD (Shot Length Deviation), the standard deviation of shot lengths for a video; ONM (Object Number Mean), the average number of objects per frame of the video; and OND (Object Number Deviation), the standard deviation of the number of objects per frame across the video. Each of these indexes provides a unique perspective on video content. A novel video retrieval interface has been developed as a platform to examine our assumption that the new indexes facilitate some video retrieval tasks. Initial feedback is promising and formal experiments are planned.
860519	Enhancing cross-language information retrieval by an automatic acquisition of bilingual terminology from comparable corpora This paper presents an approach to bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora and evaluations on Cross-Language Information Retrieval. We explore a bi-directional extraction of bilingual terminology primarily from comparable corpora. A combined statistics-based and linguistics-based model to select best translation candidates to phrasal translation is proposed. Evaluations using a large test collection for Japanese-English revealed the proposed combination of bi-directional comparable corpora, bilingual dictionaries and transliteration, augmented with linguistics-based pruning to be highly effective in Cross-Language Information Retrieval.
860520	Document-self expansion for text categorization Approaches to increase training examples to hopefully improve classification effectiveness are proposed in this work. The approaches were verified by use of two Chinese collections classified by two top-performing classifiers.

860522	User-trainable video annotation using multimodal cues This paper describes progress towards a general framework for incorporating multimodal cues into a trainable system for automatically annotating user-defined semantic concepts in broadcast video. Models of arbitrary concepts are constructed by building classifiers in a score space defined by a pre-deployed set of multimodal models. Results show annotation for user-defined concepts both in and outside the pre-deployed set is competitive with our best video-only models on the TREC Video 2002 corpus. An interesting side result shows speech-only models give performance comparable to our best video-only models for detecting visual concepts such as "outdoors", "face" and "cityscape".

860524	Error analysis of difficult TREC topics Given the experimental nature of information retrieval, progress critically depends on analyzing the errors made by existing retrieval approaches and understanding their limitations. Our research explores various hypothesized reasons for hard topics in TREC-8 ad hoc task, and shows that the bad performance is partially due to the existence of highly distracting sub-collections that can dominate the overall performance.
860525	XML retrieval: what to retrieve? The fundamental difference between standard information retrieval and XML retrieval is the unit of retrieval. In traditional IR, the unit of retrieval is fixed: it is the complete document. In XML retrieval, every XML element in a document is a retrievable unit. This makes XML retrieval more difficult: besides being relevant, a retrieved unit should be neither too large nor too small. The research presented here, a comparative analysis of two approaches to XML retrieval, aims to shed light on which XML elements should be retrieved. The experimental evaluation uses data from the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval (INEX 2002).
860526	Discovering and structuring information flow among bioinformatics resources In this poster, we present a model of the flow of information among bioinformatics resources in the context of a specific scientific problem. Combining task analysis with traditional, qualitative research, we determined the extent to which the bioinformatics analysis process could be automated. The model represents a semi-automated process, involving fourteen distinct data processing steps, and forms the framework for an interface to bioinformatics information.
860527	eBizSearch: a niche search engine for e-business Niche Search Engines offer an efficient alternative to traditional search engines when the results returned by general-purpose search engines do not provide a sufficient degree of relevance. By taking advantage of their domain of concentration they achieve higher relevance and offer enhanced features. We discuss a new niche search engine, eBizSearch, based on the technology of CiteSeer and dedicated to e-business and e-business documents. We present the integration of CiteSeer in the framework of eBizSearch and the process necessary to tune the whole system towards the specific area of e-business. We also discuss how using machine learning algorithms we generate metadata to make eBizSearch Open Archives compliant. eBizSearch is a publicly available service and can be reached at [3].
860528	Single n-gram stemming Stemming can improve retrieval accuracy, but stemmers are language-specific. Character n-gram tokenization achieves many of the benefits of stemming in a language independent way, but its use incurs a performance penalty. We demonstrate that selection of a single n-gram as a pseudo-stem for a word can be an effective and efficient language-neutral approach for some languages.

860532	A personalised information retrieval tool Industry professionals and everyday users of the Internet have long accepted that due to both the size and growth of this ubiquitous repository, new tools are needed to assist with the finding and extraction of very specific resources relevant to a user's task. Previously, this definition of relevance has been based on the extremely generic matching between resources and query terms, but recently the emphasis is shifting towards a more personalised model based on the relevance of a particular resource for one specific user. We introduce a prototype, tt Fetch, which adopts this concept within an information-seeking environment specifically designed to provide users with the means to better describe a problem (s)he doesn't understand.
860533	Classification of source code archives The World Wide Web contains a number of source code archives. Programs are usually classified into various categories within the archive by hand. We report on experiments for automatic classification of source code into these categories. We examined a number of factors that affect classification accuracy. Weighting features by expected entropy loss makes a significant improvement in classification accuracy. We show a Support Vector Machine can be trained to classify source code with a high degree of accuracy. We feel these results show promise for software reuse.

860536	Image classification using hybrid neural networks Use of semantic content is one of the major issues which needs to be addressed for improving image retrieval effectiveness. We present a new approach to classify images based on the combination of image processing techniques and hybrid neural networks. Multiple keywords are assigned to an image to represent its main contents, i.e. semantic content. Images are divided into a number of regions and colour and texture features are extracted. The first classifier, a self-organising map (SOM) clusters similar images based on the extracted features. Then, regions of the representative images of these clusters were labeled and used to train the second classifier, composed of several support vector machines (SVMs). Initial experiments on the accuracy of keyword assignment for a small vocabulary are reported.
860537	On an equivalence between PLSI and LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a fully generative approach to language modelling which overcomes the inconsistent generative semantics of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI). This paper shows that PLSI is a maximum a posteriori estimated LDA model under a uniform Dirichlet prior, therefore the perceived shortcomings of PLSI can be resolved and elucidated within the LDA framework.
860538	Query word deletion prediction Web search query logs contain traces of users' search modifications. One strategy users employ is deleting terms, presumably to obtain greater coverage. It is useful to model and automate term deletion when arbitrary searches are conjunctively matched against a small hand constructed collection, such as a hand-built hierarchy, or collection of high-quality pages matched with key phrases. Queries with no matches can have words deleted till a match is obtained. We provide algorithms which perform substantially better than the baseline in predicting which word should be deleted from a reformulated query, for increasing query coverage in the context of web search on small high-quality collections.
860539	Assessing the effectiveness of pen-based input queries In this poster, we describe an experiment exploring the effectiveness of a pen based text input device for use in query construction. Standard TREC queries were written, recognised, and subsequently retrieved upon. Comparisons between retrieval effectiveness based on the recognised writing and a typed text baseline were made. On average, effectiveness was 75% of the baseline. Other statistics on the quality and nature of recognition are also reported. .
860540	A light weight PDA-friendly collection fusion technique This short paper presents a light weight technique to merge results lists obtained from querying different databases. The motivation for such a technique is a general purpose search engine for Palm-OS based PDAs.
860541	Speech-based and video-supported indexing of multimedia broadcast news This paper describes an automatic content indexing system for news programs, with a special emphasis on its segmentation process. The process can successfully segment an entire news program into topic-centered news stories; the primary tool is a linguistic topic segmentation algorithm. Experiments show that the resulting speech-based segments are fairly accurate, and scene change points supplied by an external video processor can be of help in improving segmentation effectiveness.
860542	Summary evaluation and text categorization In general terms the evaluation of a summary depends on how close it is to the chief points in the source text. This begets the question as to what are the chief points in the source text and how is this information used in itself in identifying the source text. This is crucially important when we discuss automatic evaluation of summaries. So the question of main points is the source text. Typically, this would be around a nucleus of keywords. However, the salience, the frequency, and the relationship of the text with other texts in the collection (of these keywords is perhaps) are important. Text categorisation using neural networks explicates these points well and also has a practical impact.
860543	Rule-based word clustering for text classification This paper introduces a rule-based, context-dependent word clustering method, with the rules derived from various domain databases and the word text orthographic properties. Besides significant dimensionality reduction, our experiments show that such rule-based word clustering improves by 8 the overall accuracy of extracting bibliographic fields from references, and by 18.32 on average the class-specific performance on the line classification of document headers.
860544	HAT: a hardware assisted TOP-DOC inverted index component A novel Hardware Assisted Top-Doc (HAT) component is disclosed. HAT is an optimized content indexing device based on a modified inverted index structure. HAT accommodates patterns of different lengths and supports a varied posting list versus term count feature sustaining high reusability and efficiency. The developed component can be used either as an internal slave component or as an external co-processor and is efficient in resource demands as the component controllers take only a minimal percentage of the target device space leaving the majority of the space to term and posting entries. A Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is used to model the HAT system.
860545	An information-theoretic measure for document similarity Recent work has demonstrated that the assessment of pairwise object similarity can be approached in an axiomatic manner using information theory. We extend this concept specifically to document similarity and test the effectiveness of an information-theoretic measure for pairwise document similarity. We adapt query retrieval to rate the quality of document similarity measures and demonstrate that our proposed information-theoretic measure for document similarity yields statistically significant improvements over other popular measures of similarity.
860546	Optimizing term vectors for efficient and robust filtering We describe an efficient, robust method for selecting and optimizing terms for a classification or filtering task. Terms are extracted from positive examples in training data based on several alternative term-selection algorithms, then combined additively after a simple term-score normalization step to produce a merged and ranked master term vector. The score threshold for the master vector is set via beta-gamma regulation over all the available training data. The process avoids para-meter calibrations and protracted training. It also results in compact profiles for run-time evaluation of test (new) documents. Results on TREC-2002 filtering-task datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over TREC-median results and rival both idealized IR-based results and optimized (and expensive) SVM-based classifiers in general effectiveness.
860547	The TREC-like evaluation of music IR systems This poster reports upon the ongoing efforts being made to establish TREC-like and other comprehensive evaluation paradigms within the Music IR (MIR) and Music Digital Library (MDL) research communities. The proposed research tasks are based upon expert opinion garnered from members of the Information Retrieval (IR), MDL and MIR communities with regard to the construction and implementation of scientifically valid evaluation frameworks.
