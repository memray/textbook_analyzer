The fused library: integrating digital and physical libraries with location-aware sensors
This paper reports an investigation into the connection of the workspace of physical libraries with digital library services. Using simple sensor technology, we provide focused access to digital resources on the basis of the user's physical context, including the topic of the stacks they are next to, and the content of books on their reading desks. Our research developed the technological infrastructure to support this fused interaction, investigated current patron behavior in physical libraries, and evaluated our system in a user-centred pilot study. The outcome of this research demonstrates the potential utility of the fused library, and provides a starting point for future exploitation.
