Designing interconnected distributed resources for collaborative inquiry based science education
This paper describes the design and evaluation of a distributed information resource system (IRS) shared between field and laboratory settings for higher education geology students. An investigation of geo-science scholarship and technical pilot studies highlighted the importance of situational specific and distributed information usage. To advance our understanding of novel resource approaches (i.e. from tabletops to tablets) and collaborative learning, two in-depth field trials evaluated 21 students' information journeys (i.e. initiating information needs, facilitating information and collaborative interpretation). Analysis identified how a designing for a varied device ecology supported information filtering and empathy between locations provoking deeper reflection and abstract understanding in the field, while live collaborative remote interaction provided an engaging yet distinct learning experience for those in the laboratory.
