The challenges in developing digital collections of phonograph records
To facilitate long-term preservation and sustain the utility of phonograph records, an efficient and economical workflow management system for digitization is necessary. We describe in this paper the digitization process for building an online digital collection of phonograph records and our procedure for creating the ground-truth data, which is essential for developing an efficient metadata and content capturing system. We also discuss the challenges of defining metadata for phonograph records and their packaging to enhance access and use across traditional boundaries.
