Representing publication and distribution practices for scholarly materials: a cross-disciplinary comparison
This poster presents a pluralistic approach for representing discipline-specific, cross-disciplinary, and discipline-independent work practices related to scholarly communication. This approach has been applied to qualitative analysis from an investigation of publication and distribution practices of scholars within the biological sciences and the field of communication. The resulting representations illustrate shared work practices and areas where diverse practices exist, both of which can guide the development of digital collections of scholarly materials. This poster also considers challenges related to aligning data collection methods with the application of these representational techniques.
