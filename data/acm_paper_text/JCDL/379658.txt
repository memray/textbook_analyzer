Transcript-free search of audio archives for the national gallery of the spoken word
The National Gallery of the Spoken Word (NGSW) project is creating a carefully organized on-line repository of spoken-word collections spanning the 20th century. Unprecedented technical challenges are inherent in the development of an archive of such extensive scale and diversity. This paper describes research on the development of text-free search-engine technology used to locate requested content in the audio records. A companion paper in these proceedings addresses watermarking technologies for copyright protection.
