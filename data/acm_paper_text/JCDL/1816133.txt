Evaluating methods to rediscover missing web pages from the web infrastructure
Missing web pages (pages that return the 404 "Page Not Found error) are part of the browsing experience. The manual use of search engines to rediscover missing pages can be frustrating and unsuccessful. We compare four automated methods for rediscovering web pages. We extract the page's title, generate the page's lexical signature (LS), obtain the page's tags from the bookmarking website delicious.com and generate a LS from the page's link neighborhood. We use the output of all methods to query Internet search engines and analyze their retrieval performance. Our results show that both LSs and titles perform fairly well with over 60\% URIs returned top ranked from Yahoo!. However, the combination of methods improves the retrieval performance. Considering the complexity of the LS generation, querying the title first and in case of insufficient results querying the LSs second is the preferable setup. This combination accounts for more than 75\% top ranked URIs.
