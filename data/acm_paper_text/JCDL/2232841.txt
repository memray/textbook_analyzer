Re-ranking bibliographic records for personalized library search
This work will introduce a new approach to ranking bibliographic records in library search, which is currently dominated by an OPAC style search paradigm, where results are typically not ranked by relevance. The approach we propose in the paper provides the user with the ability to access bibliographic records in a way responsive to his or her preferences, which is essentially done by looking at a community or a group of people who share interests with the user and making use of their publication records to re-rank search results. The experiment found that the present approach gives a clear edge over conventional search methods.
