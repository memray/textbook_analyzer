StoryBank: an indian village community digital library
This paper considers information access styles for a community digital library in an Indian village. We present our impressions of the community gathered during a field-study and show how these have influenced the interaction design. The prototype aims to overcome low-textual literacy and lack of computing experience by combining touch-based interaction, engaging visual presentations and drawing on villagers' familiarity with radio listening.
