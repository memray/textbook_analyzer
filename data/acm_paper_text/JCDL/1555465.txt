Addressing researchers' needs through the data curation profile
This poster describes a study currently in progress that seeks to identify and address the needs of researchers from multiple disciplines in managing, curating and preserving their data. One output of this study, which is still in its early stages, will be the "data curation profile," a methodological tool designed to enable the comparison of needs across disciplines and help librarians build digital libraries that accurately reflect and address the needs of data producers.
