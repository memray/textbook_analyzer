collecting fragmentary-authors in a-digital library this paper discusses new work to represent , in a-digital library of classical sources , authors whose works themselves are lost and who survive only where surviving authors quote , paraphrase or allude to them . it describes initial works from a-digital collection of such fragmentary-authors designed not only to capture but to extend the ontologies that traditional scholarship has developed over generations : the aim is representing every nuance of print conventions while using the capabilities of digital-libraries to extend our ability to identify fragments , to represent what we have identified , and to render the results of that work intellectually and physically more accessible than was possible in print culture .
