a quantified fidelity criterion for parameter-embedded watermarking of audio archives a novel algorithm for speech-watermarking through parametric-modeling is enhanced by inclusion of a quantified fidelity criterion . watermarking is effected through solution of a set-membership filtering (smf) problem , subject to an l ? fidelity criterion in the signal-space . the smf approach provides flexibility in obtaining watermark solutions that trade-off watermark robustness and stegosignal fidelity .
