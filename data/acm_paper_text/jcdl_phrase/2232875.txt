how do people organize their photos in each event and how does it affect storytelling , searching and interpretation tasks ? this paper explores photo-organization within an event photo stream , i.e. the chronological sequence of photos from a single event . the problem is important : with the advent of inexpensive , easy-to-use photo capture devices , people can take a large number of photos per event . a family trip , for example , may include hundreds of photos . in this work , we have developed a photo-browser that uses automatically segmented groups of photos -- referred to as chapters -- to organize such photos . the photo-browser also affords users with a drag-and-drop interface to refine the chapter groupings . we conducted an exploratory-study of 23 college-students with their 8096 personal-photos from 92 events , to understand the role of different spatial-organization strategies in our chapter-based photo-browser , in performing storytelling , photo search and photo set interpretation tasks . we also report novel insights on how the subjects organized their photos into chapters . we tested three layout strategies : bi-level , grid-stacking and space-filling , against a baseline plain grid layout . we found that subjects value the chronological order of the chapters more than maximizing screen-space usage and that they value chapter consistency more than the chronological order of the photos . for automatic chapter groupings , having low chapter boundary misses is more important than having low chapter boundary false-alarms ; the choice of chapter criteria and granularity for chapter groupings are very subjective ; and subjects found that chapter-based photo-organization helps in all three tasks of the user-study . users preferred the chapter-based layout strategies to the baseline at a statistically significant level , with the grid-stacking strategy preferred the most .
