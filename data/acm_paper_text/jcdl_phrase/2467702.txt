user-centered-approach in creating a metadata-schema for video-games and interactive-media video-games and interactive-media are increasingly becoming important part of our culture and everyday-life , and subsequently , of archival and digital-library-collections . however , existing organizational-systems often use vague or inconsistent terms to describe video-games or attempt to use schemas designed for textual bibliographic resources . our research aims to create a standardized metadata-schema and encoding-scheme that provides an intelligent and comprehensive way to represent video-games . we conducted interviews with 24 gamers , focusing on their video game-related information-needs and seeking behaviors . we also performed a domain-analysis of current organizational-systems used in catalog records and popular game websites , evaluating metadata elements used to describe games . with these results in mind , we created a list of elements which form a metadata-schema for describing video-games , with both a core set of 16 elements and an extended set of 46 elements providing more flexibility in expressing the nature of a game .
