exploring the relationship between personal and public annotations today people typically read and annotate printed documents even if they are obtained from electronic sources like digital-libraries if there is a reason for them to share these personal annotations online , they must re-enter them . given the advent of better computer-support for reading and annotation , including tablet interfaces , will people ever share their personal digital ink annotations as is , or will they make substantial changes to them ? what can we do to anticipate and support the transition from personal to public annotations ? to investigate these questions , we performed a study to characterize and compare students ' personal annotations as they read assigned papers with those they shared with each other using an online system . by analyzing over 1 , 700 annotations , we confirmed three hypotheses : (1) only a small fraction of annotations made while reading are directly related to those shared in discussion ; (2) some types of annotations - those that consist of anchors in the text coupled with margin notes - are more apt to be the basis of public-commentary than other types of annotations ; and (3) personal annotations undergo dramatic changes when they are shared in discussion , both in content and in how they are anchored to the source document . we then use these findings to explore ways to support the transition from personal to public annotations .
