a practical ontology for the large-scale modeling of scholarly artifacts and their usage the large-scale-analysis of scholarly artifact usage is constrained primarily by current practices in usage-data archiving , privacy-issues concerned with the dissemination of usage-data , and the lack of a practical ontology for modeling the usage domain . as a remedy to the third constraint , this article presents a scholarly ontology that was engineered to represent those classes for which large-scale bibliographic and usage-data exists , supports usage research , and whose instantiation is scalable to the order of 50 million articles along with their associated artifacts (e.g. authors and journals) and an accompanying 1 billion usage events . the real-world instantiation of the presented abstract-ontology is a semantic-network model of the scholarly community which lends the scholarly process to statistical-analysis and computational support . we present the ontology , discuss its instantiation , and provide some example inference-rules for calculating various scholarly artifact metrics .
