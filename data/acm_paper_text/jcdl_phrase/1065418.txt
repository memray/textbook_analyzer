automatic-extraction of titles from general documents using machine-learning in this paper , we propose a machine-learning-approach to title extraction from general documents . by general documents , we mean documents that can belong to any one of a number of specific genres , including presentations , book chapters , technical papers , brochures , reports , and letters . previously , methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers . it has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents . as a case-study , we consider extraction from office including word and powerpoint . in our approach , we annotate titles in sample documents (for word and powerpoint respectively) and take them as training-data , train machine-learning models , and perform title extraction using the trained models . our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font-size as features in the models . it turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents . precision-and-recall for title extraction from word is 0.810 and 0.837 respectively , and precision-and-recall for title extraction from powerpoint is 0.875 and 0.895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data . other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain , and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language . moreover , we can significantly improve search-ranking results in document-retrieval by using the extracted titles .
