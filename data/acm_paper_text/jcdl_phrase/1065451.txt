integrating collections at the cervantes-project unlike many efforts that focus on supporting scholarly research by developing large-scale , general resources for a wide range of audiences , we at the cervantes-project have chosen to focus more narrowly on developing resources in support of ongoing research about the life and works of a single author , miguel de cervantes saavedra (1547-1616) . this has lead to a group of hypertextual archives , tightly integrated around the narrative and thematic-structure of don quixote . this project is typical of many humanities-research efforts and we discuss how our experiences inform the broader challenge of developing resources to support humanities-research .
