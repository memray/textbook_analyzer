supporting biological-information work : research and education for digital resources and long-lived-data new practices are emerging in all stages of biological research , from data-collection through dissemination of results . through a series of cooperative projects with biologists working in data-intensive and informatics-based domains , we have documented requirements for digital-libraries , tool-development , and data-management techniques to support contemporary scientific practice . this research is now serving as the foundation for a new biological informatics master 's program to train scientific information specialists to manage and integrate scientific information and tools to support scientific problem-solving and communication .
