adaptive graphical approach to entity-resolution entity-resolution is a very common information quality (iq) problem with many different applications . in digital-libraries , it is related to problems of citation-matching and author-name-disambiguation ; in natural-language-processing , it is related to coreference matching and object identity ; in web-application , it is related to web-page disambiguation . the problem of entity-resolution arises because objects/entities in real-world datasets are often referred to by descriptions , which might not be unique identifiers of these entities , leading to ambiguity . the goal is to group all the entity descriptions that refer to the same real-world entities . in this paper we present a graphical approach for entity-resolution . it complements the traditional methodology with the analysis of the entity-relationship-graph constructed for the dataset being analyzed . the paper demonstrates that a technique that measures the degree of interconnectedness between various pairs of nodes in the graph can significantly improve the quality of entity-resolution . furthermore , the paper presents an algorithm for making that technique self-adaptive to the underlying data , thus minimizing the required participation from the domain-analyst and potentially further improving the disambiguation quality .
