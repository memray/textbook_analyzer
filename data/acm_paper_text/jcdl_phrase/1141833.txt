selecting books : a performance-based study our research compares the impact of paper vs. electronic presentation of text on the book-selection process . our focus is on the stage of book-selection in which users study the content of a book to decide whether it will be useful for their intended purpose . effectiveness is operationalized as accurate determination of whether a non-fiction book contains enough discussion of a particular topic to be useful for a research-paper . 24 undergraduates participated in a balanced study in which they were given a topic-book pair and asked to decide whether the book was useful for the topic . we explore the differences in performance , with specific reference to the role of the search function , table-of-contents and index .
