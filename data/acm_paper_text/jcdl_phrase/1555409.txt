using web-information for author-name-disambiguation in digital-libraries , ambiguous author-names may occur due to the existence of multiple authors with the same name (polysemes) or different name variations for the same author (synonyms) . we proposed here a new method that uses information available on the web to deal with both problems at the same time . our idea consists of gathering information from input citations and submitting queries to a web-search-engine , aiming at finding curricula vitae and web-pages containing publications of the ambiguous authors . from the content of documents in the answer sets returned by the-web search-engine , useful information that can help in the disambiguation-process is extracted . using this information , author-names are disambiguated by leveraging a hierarchical-clustering method that groups citations in the same document together in a bottom-up fashion . experimental-results show that the our method yields results that outperform those of two state-of-the-art unsupervised-methods and are statistically comparable with those of a supervised one , but requiring no training . we observe gains of up to 65.2 \ % in the pairwise f1 metric when compared with our best unsupervised baseline method .
