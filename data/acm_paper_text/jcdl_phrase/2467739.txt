the user-centered-development and testing of a dublin-core metadata tool digital-libraries are supported by good quality metadata , and thus by the use of good quality metadata tools . the design of metadata tools can be supported by following user-centered-design processes . in this paper we discuss the application and evaluation of several cognitively-based rules , derived from the work of donald norman , to the design of a metadata tool for administering dublin-core metadata . one overall finding was that while the use of the rules supported users in their immediate interactions with the tool interface , they provided less support for the more cognitively intensive tasks associated with developing a wider conceptual understanding of the purpose of metadata . the findings have implications for the wider development of tools to support metadata work in digital-libraries and allied contexts .
