recommending related papers based on digital-library access records an important goal for digital-libraries is to enable researchers to more easily explore related work . while citation data is often used as an indicator of relatedness , in this paper we demonstrate that digital access records (e.g. http-server logs) can be used as indicators as well . in particular , we show that measures based on co-access provide better coverage than co-citation , that they are available much sooner , and that they are more accurate for recent papers .
