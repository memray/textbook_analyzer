an ethnographic-study of music-information seeking : implications for the design of a music-digital-library at present , music-digital-library systems are being developed based on anecdotal-evidence of user-needs , intuitive feelings for user-information seeking behavior , and a priori assumptions of typical usage scenarios . emphasis has been placed on basic-research into music document-representation , efficient searching , and audio-based searching , rather than on exploring the music-information needs or information-behavior of a target user-group . this paper focuses on eliciting the native music-information strategies employed by people searching for popular-music (that is , music sought for recreational or enjoyment purposes rather than to support a serious or scientific exploration of some aspect of music) . to this end , we conducted an ethnographic-study of the searching/browsing techniques employed by people in the researchers local communities , as they use two common sources of music : the public-library and music stores . we argue that the insights provided by this type of study can inform the development of searching/browsing support for music-digital-libraries .
