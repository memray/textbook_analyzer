a system for adding content-based-searching to a traditional-music library-catalogue server most online-music library-catalogues can only be searched by textual m etadata . whilst highly effective - since the rules for maintaining consistency have been refined over many years - this does not allow searching by musical content . many music librarians are familiar with users humming their enquiries . most systems providing a query-by-humming interface tend to run independently of music library-catalogue systems and not offer similar textual-metadata searching . this demonstration shows how we can integrate these two types of system based on work conducted as part of the nsf/jisc funded omras project (http://www.omras.org) .
