the ownership and reuse of visual-media this paper presents the results of a study of the ownership and reuse of visual-media . a survey was administered to 250 social media-savvy respondents to investigate their attitudes about saving , sharing , publishing , and removing online photos ; the survey also explored participants ' current photo-sharing and reuse practices , and their general expectations of photo reuse . our probe of respondent attitudes revealed that respondents felt : (1) people should be able to save visual-media , regardless of its source ; (2) people have slightly less right to reuse photos than they do to save them ; (3) a photo 's subject has a slightly greater right than the photographer to reuse the photo in non-commercial situations ; (4) removal is controversial , but trends more positive when it involves only metadata (e.g. tags) ; and (5) access to institutional archives of personal-photos is better deferred for 50 years . participants explained their own reuse of online photos in pragmatic terms that included the nature of the content , the aim and circumstances of reuse , their sense of the photo 's original use , and their understanding of existing laws and restrictions . in the abstract , the same general question revealed a ` reuse paradox ' ; while respondents trust themselves to make this judgment , they do not trust the reciprocal judgment of unknown others .
