automatically characterizing resource-quality for educational-digital-libraries with the rise of community-generated web-content , the need for automatic-characterization of resource-quality has grown , particularly in the realm of educational-digital-libraries . we demonstrate how identifying concrete factors of quality for web-based-educational-resources can make machine-learning-approaches to automating quality characterization tractable . using data from several previous studies of quality , we gathered a set of key dimensions and indicators of quality that were commonly identified by educators . we then performed a mixed-method study of digital-library curation experts , showing that our characterization of quality captured the subjective processes used by the experts when assessing resource-quality for classroom-use . using key indicators of quality selected from a statistical analysis of our expert study data , we developed a set of annotation guidelines and annotated a corpus of 1000 digital-resources for the presence or absence of these key quality-indicators . agreement among annotators was high , and initial machine-learning models trained from this corpus were able to identify some indicators of quality with as much as an 18 \ % improvement over the baseline .
