representing aggregate works in the digital-library this paper studies the challenge of representing aggregate works such as encyclopedias , collected poems and journals in heterogenous digital-library-collections . reflecting on the materials used by humanities academics , we demonstrate the varied range of aggregate types and the problems of faithfully representing this in the dl interface . aggregates are complex and pervasive , challenge common assumptions and confuse boundaries within organisational structures . existing dl systems can only provide imperfect representation of aggregates , and alterations to document encoding are insufficient to create a faithful reproduction of the physical library . the challenge is amplified through concrete examples , and solutions are demonstrated in a well-known dl system and related to standard dl-architecture .
