exploring user-perceptions of digital-image similarity the midas project is developing infrastructure and policies for optimal display of digital-information on devices with diverse characteristics . in this paper we present the preliminary results of a study that explored the effects of scaling and color-depth variation in digital-photographs on user-perceptions of similarity . our results indicate general trends in user-preferences and can serve as guidelines for designing policies and systems that display digital-images optimally on various information devices .
