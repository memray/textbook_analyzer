document-relevance assessment via term-distribution analysis using fourier-series expansion in addition to the frequency of terms in a document-collection , the distribution of terms plays an important role in determining the relevance of documents for a given search-query . in this paper , term-distribution analysis using fourier-series expansion as a novel approach for calculating an abstract-representation of term positions in a document-corpus is introduced . based on this approach , two methods for improving the evaluation of document-relevance are proposed : (a) a function-based ranking optimization representing a user defined document region , and (b) a query-expansion technique based on overlapping the term distributions in the top-ranked documents . experimental-results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing new possibilities for optimizing the retrieval-process .
