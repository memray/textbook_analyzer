regularized clustering for documents in recent years , document-clustering has been receiving more and more attentions as an important and fundamental technique for unsupervised document organization , automatictopic extraction , and fast information-retrieval or filtering . in this paper , we propose a novel method for clustering documents using regularization . unlike traditional globally regularized clustering-methods , our method first construct a local regularized linear label predictor for each document-vector , and then combine all those local regularizers with a global smoothness regularizer . so we call our algorithm clustering with local and global regularization (clgr) . we will show that the cluster memberships of the documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric-matrix , which can be efficiently solved by iterative-methods . finally our experimental evaluations on several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of clgr over traditional document clustering-methods .
