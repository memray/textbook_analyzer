studying the use of popular destinations to enhance web-search interaction we present a novel web-search interaction feature which , for a given query , provides links to websites frequently visited by other users with similar information-needs . these popular destinations complement traditional search-results , allowing direct navigation to authoritative resources for the query topic . destinations are identified using the history of search and browsing-behavior of many users over an extended time period , whose collective-behavior provides a basis for computing source authority . we describe a user-study which compared the suggestion of destinations with the previously proposed suggestion of related queries , as well as with traditional , unaided web-search . results show that search enhanced by destination suggestions outperforms other systems for exploratory tasks , with best performance obtained from mining past user-behavior at query-level granularity .
