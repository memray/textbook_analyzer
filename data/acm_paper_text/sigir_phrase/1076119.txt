impedance coupling in content-targeted advertising the current boom of the-web is associated with the revenues originated from on-line-advertising . while search-based-advertising is dominant , the association of ads with a web-page (during user-navigation) is becoming increasingly important . in this work , we study the problem of associating ads with a web-page , referred to as content-targeted advertising , from a computer science perspective . we assume that we have access to the text of the-web page , the keywords declared by an advertiser , and a text associated with the advertiser 's business . using no other information and operating in fully automatic fashion , we propose ten strategies for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness . our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem (referred to as aak for `` ads and keywords '') can yield gains in average-precision figures of 60 \ % compared to a trivial vector-based strategy . further , a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy , which expands the text of the-web page to reduce vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement , can yield extra gains in average-precision of 50 \ % . these are first results . they suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms .
