the wisdom of the few : a collaborative-filtering-approach based on expert-opinions from the-web nearest-neighbor collaborative-filtering provides a successful means of generating recommendations for web users . however , this approach suffers from several shortcomings , including data-sparsity and noise , the cold-start-problem , and scalability . in this work , we present a novel method for recommending items to users based on expert-opinions . our method is a variation of traditional collaborative-filtering : rather than applying a nearest-neighbor algorithm to the user-rating data , predictions are computed using a set of expert neighbors from an independent dataset , whose opinions are weighted according to their similarity to the user . this method promises to address some of the weaknesses in traditional collaborative-filtering , while maintaining comparable accuracy . we validate our approach by predicting a subset of the netflix data-set . we use ratings crawled from a web-portal of expert-reviews , measuring results both in terms of prediction-accuracy and recommendation list precision . finally , we explore the ability of our method to generate useful recommendations , by reporting the results of a user-study where users prefer the recommendations generated by our approach .
