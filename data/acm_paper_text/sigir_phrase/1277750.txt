utility-based information distillation over temporally sequenced documents this paper examines a new approach to information distillation over temporally ordered documents , and proposes a novel evaluation-scheme for such a framework . it combines the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive-filtering , novelty-detection and non-redundant passage-ranking with respect to long-lasting information-needs (`` tasks '' with multiple-queries) . our approach supports fine-grained user-feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text , and leverages such information for utility optimization in adaptive settings . for our experiments , we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the tdt4 corpus , with multiple-queries per task . answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semi-automatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses . we also propose an extension of the ndcg metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty . our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach , compared to the baseline systems without incremental-learning or the novelty-detection components .
