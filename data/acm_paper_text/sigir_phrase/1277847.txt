vocabulary independent spoken-term-detection we are interested in retrieving information from speech-data like broadcast-news , telephone conversations and roundtable meetings . today , most systems use large-vocabulary-continuous-speech-recognition tools to produce word transcripts ; the transcripts are indexed and query terms are retrieved from the index . however , query terms that are not part of the recognizer 's vocabulary can not be retrieved , and the recall of the search is affected . in addition to the output word transcript , advanced systems provide also phonetic transcripts , against which query terms can be matched phonetically . such phonetic transcripts suffer from lower accuracy and can not be an alternative to word transcripts.we present a vocabulary independent system that can handle arbitrary queries , exploiting the information provided by having both word transcripts and phonetic transcripts . a speech-recognizer generates word confusion networks and phonetic lattices . the transcripts are indexed for query-processing and ranking purpose.the value of the proposed method is demonstrated by the relative high-performance ofour system , which received the highest overall ranking for us english-speech data in the recent nist spoken-term-detection evaluation .
