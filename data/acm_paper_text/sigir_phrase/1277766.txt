fast generation of result snippets in web-search the presentation of query biased document snippets as part of results pages presented by search-engines has become an expectation of search-engine users . in this paper we explore the algorithms-and-data-structures required as part of a search-engine to allow efficient generation of query biased snippets . we begin by proposing and analysing a document compression-method that reduces snippet-generation time by 58 \ % over a baseline using the zlib compression library . these experiments reveal that finding documents on secondary-storage dominates the total cost of generating snippets , and so caching documents in ram is essential for a fast snippet-generation process . using simulation , we examine snippet-generation performance for different size ram caches . finally we propose and analyse document reordering and compaction , revealing a scheme that increases the number of document cache hits with only a marginal affect on snippet quality . this scheme effectively doubles the number of documents that can fit in a fixed size cache .
