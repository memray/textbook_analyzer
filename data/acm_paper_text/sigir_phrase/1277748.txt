towards task-based personal-information-management evaluations personal-information-management (pim) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store , manage and refind information . a feature of pim research is that many systems have been designed to assist users manage and refind information , but very few have been evaluated . this has been noted by several scholars and explained by the difficulties involved in performing pim evaluations . the difficulties include that people re-find information from within unique personal-collections ; researchers know little about the tasks that cause people to re-find information ; and numerous privacy-issues concerning personal-information . in this paper we aim to facilitate pim evaluations by addressing each of these difficulties . in the first part , we present a diary-study of information-re-finding tasks . the study examines the kind of tasks that require users to refind information and produces a taxonomy of refinding tasks for email-messages and web-pages . in the second part , we propose a task-based-evaluation methodology based on our findings and examine the feasibility of the approach using two different methods of task creation .
