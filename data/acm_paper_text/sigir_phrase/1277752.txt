efficient bayesian hierarchical user-modeling for recommendation-system a content-based personalized-recommendation system learns user specific profiles from user-feedback so that it can deliver information tailored to each individual user 's interest . a system serving millions of users can learn a better user-profile for a new-user , or a user with little feedback , by borrowing information from other users through the use of a bayesian-hierarchical-model . learning the model-parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive . the commonly used em-algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in ir applications . this paper proposes a new fast learning-technique to learn a large number of individual user-profiles . the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user-data from netflix and movielens .
