a study of factors affecting the utility of implicit-relevance-feedback implicit-relevance-feedback (irf) is the process by which a search-system unobtrusively gathers evidence on searcher interests from their interaction with the system . irf is a new method of gathering information on user-interest and , if irf is to be used in operational ir systems , it is important to establish when it performs well and when it performs poorly . in this paper we investigate how the use and effectiveness of irf is affected by three factors : search-task complexity , the search experience of the user and the stage in the search . our findings suggest that all three of these factors contribute to the utility of irf .
