term-feedback for information-retrieval with language-models in this paper we study term-based feedback for information-retrieval in the language-modeling-approach . with term-feedback a user directly judges the relevance of individual terms without interaction with feedback documents , taking full control of the query-expansion process . we propose a cluster-based method for selecting terms to present to the user for judgment , as well as effective algorithms for constructing refined query-language models from user-term-feedback . our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in retrieval-accuracy over a non-feedback baseline , and achieve comparable performance to relevance-feedback . they are helpful even when there are no relevant documents in the top .
