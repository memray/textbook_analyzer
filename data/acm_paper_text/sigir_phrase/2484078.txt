efficient query construction for large-scale-data in recent years , a number of open databases have emerged on the web , providing web users with platforms to collaboratively create structured-information . as these databases are intended to accommodate heterogeneous-information and knowledge , they usually comprise a very-large schema and billions of instances . browsing and searching data on such a scale is not an easy task for a web user . in this context , interactive-query-construction offers an intuitive-interface for novice-users to retrieve information from databases neither requiring any knowledge of structured-query languages , nor any prior-knowledge of the database-schema . however , the existing mechanisms do not scale well on large-scale datasets . this paper presents a set of techniques to boost the scalability of interactive-query-construction , from the perspective of both , user-interaction cost and performance . we connect an abstract-ontology layer to the database-schema to shorten the process of user-computer-interaction . we also introduce a search-mechanism to enable efficient exploration of query-interpretation spaces over large-scale-data . extensive experiments show that our approach scales well on freebase - an open database containing more than 7,000 relational-tables in more than 100 domains .
