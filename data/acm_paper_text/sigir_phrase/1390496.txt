a word shape coding method for camera-based document images this paper reports a word shape coding method to facilitate retrieval of camera-based document images without ocr . due to perspective-distortion , many reported word shape coding methods fail on camera-based images . in this paper , the problem is addressed by approximating the perspective transformation with an affine-transformation , and employing an affine invariant , namely length ratio , to represent the connected-components . components in a document-image are classified into a few clusters , each of which is assigned with a representative symbol . retrieval are based on `` words '' comprising of symbols . the experiment results showed that the proposed method achieved an average retrieval-precision of 93.43 \ % and recall of 94.22 \ % .
