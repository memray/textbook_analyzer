prefetching query results and its impact on search-engines we investigate the impact of query result prefetching on the efficiency-and-effectiveness of web-search-engines . we propose offline and online strategies for selecting and ordering queries whose results are to be prefetched . the offline strategies rely on query-log-analysis and the queries are selected from the queries issued on the previous day . the online strategies select the queries from the result-cache , relying on a machine-learning-model that estimates the arrival-times of queries . we carefully evaluate the proposed prefetching techniques via simulation on a query-log obtained from yahoo! web-search . we demonstrate that our strategies are able to improve various performance-metrics , including the hit-rate , query response-time , result freshness , and query degradation rate , relative to a state-of-the-art baseline .
