cluster-based one-class ensemble for classification problems in information-retrieval a number of relevant-information retrieval classification problems are one-class-classification problems at heart . i.e. , labeled-data is only available for one class , the so-called target class , and common discrimination-based classification approaches , be them binary or multiclass , are not applicable . achieving a high effectiveness when solving one-class problems is difficult anyway and it becomes even more challenging when the target class data is multimodal , which is often the case . to address these concerns we propose a cluster-based one-class ensemble that consists of four steps : (1) applying a clustering-algorithm to the target class data , (2) training an individual one-class classifier for each of the identified clusters , (3) aggregating the decisions of the individual classifiers , and (4) selecting the best fitting clustering-model . we evaluate our approach with four datasets : an artificially generated dataset , a dataset compiled from a known multiclass text corpus , and two datasets related to one-class problems that received much attention recently , namely authorship-verification and quality flaw prediction . our approach outperforms a one-class-svm on all four datasets .
