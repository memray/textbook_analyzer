a frequency-based and a poisson-based definition of the probability of being informative this paper reports on theoretical investigations about the assumptions underlying the inverse-document-frequency (idf) . we show that an intuitive idf - based probability-function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events . by assuming documents to be independent rather than disjoint , we arrive at a poisson-based probability of being informative . the framework is useful for understanding and deciding the parameter-estimation and combination in probabilistic-retrieval-models .
