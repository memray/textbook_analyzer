on evaluation of adaptive topic-tracking systems summative-evaluation methods for supervised adaptive topic-tracking systems convolve the effect of system decisions on present utility with the effect on future utility . this paper describes a new formative-evaluation approach that focuses on future utility for use in the design stage of adaptive-systems . topic-model quality is assessed at a predefined set of points using a fixed document-set to enhance comparability . experiments using a vector-space topic-tracking system illustrate the utility of this approach to formative-evaluation .
