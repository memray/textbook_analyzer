learning user interaction-models for predicting web-search result preferences evaluating user-preferences of web-search-results is crucial for search-engine development , deployment , and maintenance . we present a real-world study of modeling the behavior of web-search users to predict web-search result preferences . accurate modeling and interpretation of user behavior has important applications to ranking , click-spam-detection , web-search personalization , and other tasks . our key insight to improving robustness of interpreting implicit feedback is to model query-dependent deviations from the expected `` noisy '' user-behavior . we show that our model of clickthrough interpretation improves prediction-accuracy over state-of-the-art clickthrough methods . we generalize our approach to model user-behavior beyond clickthrough , which results in higher preference-prediction accuracy than models based on clickthrough information alone . we report results of a large-scale experimental-evaluation that show substantial improvements over published implicit-feedback interpretation methods .
