laplacian optimal-design for image-retrieval relevance-feedback is a powerful technique to enhance content-based-image-retrieval (cbir) performance . it solicits the user 's relevance-judgments on the retrieved images returned by the cbir systems . the user 's labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images . however , the top returnedimages may not be the most informative ones . the challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e. , improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training-samples . in this paper , we propose a novel active-learning-algorithm , called laplacian optimal-design (lod) , for relevance-feedback image-retrieval . our algorithm is based on aregression model which minimizes the least-square error on the measured (or , labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image-space . specifically , we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other , then their measurements (or , labels) are close as well . by constructing a nearest-neighbor graph , the geometrical structure of the image-space can be described by the graph-laplacian . we discuss how results from the field of optimal-experimental-design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images , which gives us the most amount of information . experimental-results on corel database suggest that theproposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance-feedback image-retrieval .
