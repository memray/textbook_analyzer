relaxed online svms for spam-filtering spam is a key problem in electronic-communication , including large-scale email-systems and the growing number of blogs . content-based-filtering is one reliable method of combating this threat in its various forms , but some academic-researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam . the former have advocated the use of support-vector-machines (svms) for content-based-filtering , as this machine-learning methodology gives state-of-the-art performance for text-classification . however , similar performance gains have yet to be demonstrated for online spam-filtering . additionally , practitioners cite the high cost of svms as reason to prefer faster (if less statistically robust) bayesian-methods . in this paper , we offer a resolution to this controversy . first , we show that online svms indeed give state-of-the-art classification-performance on online spam-filtering on large benchmark data sets . second , we show that nearly equivalent performance may be achieved by a relaxed online-svm (rosvm) at greatly reduced computational cost . our results are experimentally verified on email-spam , blog spam , and splog-detection tasks .
