a semantic-approach to contextual-advertising contextual-advertising or context match (cm) refers to the placement of commercial textual advertisements within the content of a generic web-page , while sponsored-search (ss) advertising consists in placing ads on result pages from a web-search-engine , with ads driven by the originating query . in cm there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad-selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user-experience . with these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content , rather than generic ads . the ss market developed quicker than the cm market , and most textual ads are still characterized by `` bid phrases '' representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed . hence , the first technologies for cm have relied on previous solutions for ss , by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content , and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases , in a purely syntactic-approach . however , due to the vagaries of phrase-extraction , and the lack of context , this approach leads to many irrelevant ads . to overcome this problem , we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic-features .
