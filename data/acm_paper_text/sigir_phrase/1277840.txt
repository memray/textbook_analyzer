a new approach for evaluating query-expansion : query-document term-mismatch the effectiveness of information-retrieval (ir) systems is influenced by the degree of term overlap between user queries and relevant documents . query-document term-mismatch , whether partial or total , is a fact that must be dealt with by ir systems . query-expansion (qe) is one method for dealing with term-mismatch . ir systems implementing query-expansion are typically evaluated by executing each query twice , with and without query-expansion , and then comparing the two result sets . while this measures an overall change in performance , it does not directly measure the effectiveness of ir systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term-mismatch between the query and relevant documents , nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query-document term-mismatch . in this paper , we propose a new approach for evaluating query-expansion techniques . the proposed approach is attractive because it provides an estimate of system-performance under varying degrees of query-document term-mismatch , it makes use of readily available test-collections , and it does not require any additional relevance-judgments or any form of manual processing .
