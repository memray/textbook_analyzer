modeling annotated data we consider the problem of modeling annotated data -- data with multiple-types where the instance of one type (such as a caption) serves as a description of the other type (such as an image) . we describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture-models which aim to describe such data , culminating in correspondence latent-dirichlet-allocation , a latent-variable-model that is effective at modeling the joint-distribution of both types and the conditional-distribution of the annotation given the primary type . we conduct experiments on the corel database of images and captions , assessing performance in terms of held-out likelihood , automatic-annotation , and text-based-image-retrieval .
