an outranking approach for rank-aggregation in information-retrieval-research in information-retrieval usually shows performanceimprovement when many sources of evidence are combined to produce a ranking of documents (e.g. , texts , pictures , sounds , etc.) . in this paper , we focus on the rank-aggregation problem , also called data-fusion problem , where rankings of documents , searched into the same collection and provided by multiple methods , are combined in order to produce a new ranking . in this context , we propose a rank-aggregation method within a multiple criteria framework using aggregation mechanisms based on decision-rules identifying positive and negative reasons for judging whether a document should get a better rank than another . we show that the proposed method deals well with the information-retrieval distinctive features . experimental-results are reported showing that the suggested method performs better than the well-known combsum and combmnz operators .
