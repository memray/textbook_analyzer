broad expertise-retrieval in sparse-data environments expertise-retrieval has been largely unexplored on data other than the w3c collection . at the same time , many intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organisations offer examples of relatively small but clean multilingual expertise data , covering broad ranges of expertise areas . we first present two main expertise-retrieval tasks , along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language-modeling , aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people . for our experimental-evaluation , we introduce (and release) a new test-set based on a crawl of a university site . using this test-set , we conduct two series of experiments . the first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise-retrieval methods applied to the new test-set . the second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic features of the new test-set , such as the organizational-structure of the university , and the hierarchical-structure of the topics in the test-set . expertise-retrieval models are shown to be robust with respect to environments smaller than the w3c collection , and current techniques appear to be generalizable to other settings .
