using query-contexts in information-retrieval user query is an element that specifies an information-need , but it is not the only one . studies in literature have found many contextual-factors that strongly influence the interpretation of a query . recent studies have tried to consider the user 's interests by creating a user-profile . however , a single profile for a user may not be sufficient for a variety of queries of the user . in this study , we propose to use query-specific contexts instead of user-centric ones , including context around query and context-within-query . the former specifies the environment of a query such as the domain of interest , while the latter refers to context-words within the query , which is particularly useful for the selection of relevant term relations . in this paper , both types of context are integrated in an ir model based on language-modeling . our experiments on several trec collections show that each of the context factors brings significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness .
