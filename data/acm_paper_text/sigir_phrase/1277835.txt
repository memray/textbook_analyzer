query-performance-prediction in web-search environments current prediction techniques , which are generally designed for content-based-queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test-collections of small sizes , face serious challenges in web-search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist . in this paper , we present three-techniques to address these challenges . we focus on performance-prediction for two types of queries in web-search environments : content-based and named-page finding . our evaluation is mainly performed on the gov2 collection . in addition to evaluating our models for the two types of queries separately , we consider a more challenging and realistic situation that the two types of queries are mixed together without prior-information on query-types . to assist prediction under the mixed-query situation , a novel query classifier is adopted . results show that our prediction of web-query performance is substantially more accurate than the current state-of-the-art prediction techniques . consequently , our paper provides a practical approach to performance-prediction in real-world web settings .
