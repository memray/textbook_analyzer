cross-lingual query-suggestion using query-logs of different languages query-suggestion aims to suggest relevant queries for a given query , which help users better specify their information-needs . previously , the suggested terms are mostly in the same language of the input query . in this paper , we extend it to cross-lingual query-suggestion (clqs) : for a query in one language , we suggest similar or relevant queries in other languages . this is very important to scenarios of cross-language-information-retrieval (clir) and cross-lingual keyword-bidding for search-engine advertisement . instead of relying on existing query-translation technologies for clqs , we present an effective means to map the input query of one language to queries of the other language in the query-log . important monolingual and cross-lingual information such as word-translation relations and word-co-occurrence statistics , etc. are used to estimate the cross-lingual query-similarity with a discriminative-model . benchmarks show that the resulting clqs system significantly out performs a baseline system based on dictionary-based-query-translation . besides , the resulting clqs is tested with french to english clir tasks on trec collections . the results demonstrate higher effectiveness than the traditional query-translation methods .
