a support-vector method for optimizing average-precision machine-learning is commonly used to improve ranked-retrieval systems . due to computational difficulties , few learning-techniques have been developed to directly optimize for mean-average-precision (map) , despite its widespread use in evaluating such systems . existing approaches optimizing map either do not find a globally-optimal-solution , or are computationally expensive . in contrast , we present a general svm-learning algorithm that efficiently finds a globally-optimal-solution to a straightforward relaxation of map . we evaluate our approach using the trec 9 and trec 10 web track corpora (wt10g) , comparing against svms optimized for accuracy and rocarea . in most cases we show our method to produce statistically significant improvements in map scores .
