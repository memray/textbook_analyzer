robustness of adaptive-filtering methods in a cross-benchmark evaluation this paper reports a cross-benchmark evaluation of regularized logistic-regression (lr) and incremental rocchio for adaptive-filtering . using four corpora from the topic-detection-and-tracking (tdt) forum and the text-retrieval conferences (trec) we evaluated these methods with non-stationary topics at various granularity-levels , and measured performance with different utility settings . we found that lr performs strongly and robustly in optimizing t11su (a trec utility-function) while rocchio is better for optimizing ctrk (the tdt-tracking cost) , a high-recall oriented objective-function . using systematic cross-corpus parameter-optimization with both methods , we obtained the best results ever reported on tdt5 , trec10 and trec11 . relevance-feedback on a small portion (0.05 ~ 0.2 \ %) of the tdt5 test documents yielded significant performance-improvements , measuring up to a 54 \ % reduction in ctrk and a 20.9 \ % increase in t11su (with b = 0.1) , compared to the results of the top-performing system in tdt2004 without relevance-feedback information .
