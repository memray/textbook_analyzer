multimedia recommendation : technology and techniques in recent years , we have witnessed a rapid growth in the availability of digital multimedia on various application platforms and domains . consequently , the problem of information-overload has become more and more serious . in order to tackle the challenge , various multimedia recommendation technologies have been developed by different research-communities (e.g. , multimedia-systems , information-retrieval , machine-learning and computer version) . meanwhile , many commercial web-systems (e.g. , flick , youtube , and last.fm) have successfully applied recommendation techniques to provide users personalized content and services in a convenient and flexible way . when looking back , the information-retrieval (ir) community has a long history of studying and contributing recommender-system design and related issues . it has been proven that the recommender-systems can effectively assist users in handling information-overload and provide high-quality personalization . while several courses were dedicated to multimedia-retrieval in the recent decade , to the best of our knowledge , the tutorial is the first one specifically focusing on multimedia recommender-systems and their applications on various domains and media contents . we plan to summarize the research along this direction and provide an impetus for further research on this important topic
