performance-prediction using spatial-autocorrelation evaluation of information-retrieval-systems is one of the core tasks in information-retrieval . problems include the inability to exhaustively label all documents for a topic , generalizability from a small number of topics , and incorporating the variability of retrieval-systems . previous work addresses the evaluation of systems , the ranking of queries by difficulty , and the ranking of individual retrievals by performance . approaches exist for the case of few and even no relevance-judgments . our focus is on zero-judgment performance-prediction of individual retrievals . one common shortcoming of previous techniques is the assumption of uncorrelated document scores and judgments . if documents are embedded in a high-dimensional-space (as they often are) , we can apply techniques from spatial-data analysis to detect correlations between document scores . we find that the low correlation between scores of topically close documents often implies a poor retrieval-performance . when compared to a state-of-the-art baseline , we demonstrate that the spatial-analysis of retrieval scores provides significantly better prediction-performance . these new predictors can also be incorporated with classic predictors to improve performance further . we also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance-prediction for a massive number of retrieval-systems over a variety collections in several languages .
