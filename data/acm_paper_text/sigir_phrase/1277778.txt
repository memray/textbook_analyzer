topic-segmentation with shared-topic-detection and alignment of multiple-documents topic-detection-and-tracking and topic-segmentation play an important role in capturing the local and sequential-information of documents . previous work in this area usually focuses on single documents , although similar multiple-documents are available in many domains . in this paper , we introduce a novel unsupervised-method for shared-topic-detection and topic-segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual-information (mi) and weighted-mutual-information (wmi) that is a combination of mi and term-weights . the basic idea is that the optimal-segmentation maximizes mi (or wmi) . our approach can detect shared topics among documents . it can find the optimal-boundaries in a document , and align segments among documents at the same time . it also can handle single-document segmentation as a special case of the multi-document segmentation and alignment . our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term-weights based on entropy learned from multiple-documents . our experimental-results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single-document segmentation , shared-topic-detection , and multi-document segmentation . utilizing information from multiple-documents can tremendously improve the performance of topic-segmentation , and using wmi is even better than using mi for the multi-document segmentation .
