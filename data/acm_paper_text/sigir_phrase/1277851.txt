context-sensitive stemming for web-search traditionally , stemming has been applied to information-retrieval-tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing , and applying a similar transformation to query terms . although it increases recall , this naive strategy does not work well for web-search since it lowers precision and requires a significant amount of additional computation . in this paper , we propose a context-sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues . two unique properties make our approach feasible for web-search . first , based on statistical-language-modeling , we perform context-sensitive-analysis on the query side . we accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query-term with before submitting the query to the search-engine . this dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions , which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and improves the precision at the same time . second , our approach performs a context-sensitive document-matching for those expanded variants . this conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming , and it turns out to be very important for improving precision . using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach , our experiments on a major web-search-engine show that stemming only 29 \ % of the query traffic , we can improve relevance as measured by average discounted-cumulative-gain (dcg5) by 6.1 \ % on these queriesand 1.8 \ % over all query traffic .
