new-event-detection based on indexing-tree and named-entity new-event-detection (ned) aims at detecting from one or multiple-streams of news stories that which one is reported on a new event (i.e. not reported previously) . with the overwhelming volume of news available today , there is an increasing need for a ned system which is able to detect new events more efficiently and accurately . in this paper we propose a new ned model to speed up the ned task by using news indexing-tree dynamically . moreover , based on the observation that terms of different types have different effects for ned task , two term reweighting approaches are proposed to improve ned accuracy . in the first approach , we propose to adjust term-weights dynamically based on previous story clusters and in the second approach , we propose to employ statistics on training-data to learn the named-entity reweighting model for each class of stories . experimental-results on two linguistic-data-consortium (ldc) datasets tdt2 and tdt3 show that the proposed model can improve both efficiency and accuracy of ned task significantly , compared to the baseline system and other existing systems .
