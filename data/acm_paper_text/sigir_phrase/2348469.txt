estimating the magic barrier of recommender-systems : a user-study recommender-systems are commonly evaluated by trying to predict known , withheld , ratings for a set of users . measures such as the root-mean-square error are used to estimate the quality of the recommender-algorithms . this process does however not acknowledge the inherent rating inconsistencies of users . in this paper we present the first results from a noise-measurement user-study for estimating the magic barrier of recommender-systems conducted on a commercial movie-recommendation community . the magic barrier is the expected squared error of the optimal recommendation-algorithm , or , the lowest error we can expect from any recommendation-algorithm . our results show that the barrier can be estimated by collecting the opinions of users on already rated items .
