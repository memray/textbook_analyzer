the impact of caching on search-engines in this paper we study the trade-offs in designing efficient caching systems for web-search-engines . we explore the impact of different approaches , such as static vs. dynamic caching , and caching query results vs.caching posting lists . using a query-log spanning a whole year we explore the limitations of caching and we demonstrate that caching posting lists can achieve higher hit rates than caching query answers . we propose a new algorithm for static-caching of posting lists , which outperforms previous methods . we also study the problem of finding the optimal way to split the static cache between answers and posting lists . finally , we measure how the changes in the query-log affect the effectiveness of static-caching , given our observation that the distribution of the queries changes slowly over time . our results and observations are applicable to different levels of the data-access hierarchy , for instance , for a memory/disk layer or a broker/remote server layer .
