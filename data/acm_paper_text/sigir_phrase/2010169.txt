a new look at old tricks : the fertile roots of current-research as we face an explosion of potential new-applications for the fundamental concepts and technologies of information-retrieval , ranging from ad ranking to social-media , from collaborative recommending to question-answering-systems , many researchers are spending unnecessary time reinventing ideas and relationships that are buried in the prehistory of information-retrieval (which , for many researchers , means anything published before they entered graduate-school) . a lot of the ideas that surface as `` new '' in today 's super-heated research environment have very firm roots in earlier developments in fields as diverse as citation-analysis and pattern-recognition . the purpose of this tutorial is to survey those roots , and their relation to the contemporary fruits on the tree of information-retrieval , and to separate , as much as is possible in an era of increasing secrecy about methods , the problems to be solved , the algorithms for solving them , and the heuristics that are the bread and butter of a working operation . participants will become familiar with roots in pattern-analysis , statistics , information-science and other sources of key ideas that reappear in the current development of information retrieval as it applies to search-engines , social-media , and collaborative-systems . they will be able to separate problems from algorithms , and algorithms from heuristics , in the application of these ideas to their own research and/or development-activities . course materials will be made available on a web-site two weeks prior to the tutorial . they will include links to relevant software ; links to publications that will be discussed ; and mechanisms for chat among the tutorial participants , before , during and after the tutorial .
