hits on the web : how does it compare ? this paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of hits in comparison with other link-based-ranking algorithms , when used in combination with a state-of-the-art text-retrieval-algorithm exploiting anchor-text . we quantified their effectiveness using three common performance-measures : the mean reciprocal rank , the mean-average-precision , and the normalized-discounted-cumulative-gain measurements . the evaluation is based on two large-data-sets : a breadth-first-search crawl of 463 million web-pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct urls ; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query-log , each query having on average 2,383 results , about 17 of which were labeled by judges . we found that hits outperforms pagerank , but is about as effective as web-page in-degree . the same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text-retrieval-algorithm . finally , we studied the relationship between query-specificity and the effectiveness of selected features , and found that link-based features perform better for general queries , whereas bm25f performs better for specific queries .
