latent concept-expansion using markov-random-fields query-expansion , in the form of pseudo-relevance-feedback or relevance-feedback , is a common technique used to improve retrieval-effectiveness . most previous approaches have ignored important issues , such as the role of features and the importance of modeling term dependencies . in this paper , we propose a robust-query-expansion technique based onthe markov-random-field-model for information-retrieval . the technique , called latent concept-expansion , provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expansion . furthermore , the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond simple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques . we evaluate our technique against relevance-models , a state-of-the-art language-modeling query-expansion technique . our model demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval-effectiveness across several trec-data sets . we also describe how our technique can be used to generate meaningful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query suggestion/reformulation .
