system effectiveness , user-models , and user utility : a conceptual-framework for investigation there is great interest in producing effectiveness-measures that model user-behavior in order to better model the utility of a system to its users . these measures are often formulated as a sum over the product of a discount function of ranks and a gain-function mapping relevance-assessments to numeric utility values . we develop a conceptual-framework for analyzing such effectiveness-measures based on classifying members of this broad family of measures into four distinct families , each of which reflects a different notion of system utility . within this framework we can hypothesize about the properties that such a measure should have and test those hypotheses against user and system data . along the way we present a collection of novel results about specific measures and relationships between them .
