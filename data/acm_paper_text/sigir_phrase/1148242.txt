text-clustering with extended user-feedback text-clustering is most commonly treated as a fully automated task without user-feedback . however , a variety of researchers have explored mixed-initiative clustering-methods which allow a user to interact with and advise the clustering algorithm . this mixed-initiative approach is especially attractive for text-clustering tasks where the user is trying to organize a corpus of documents into clusters for some particular purpose (e.g. , clustering their email into folders that reflect various activities in which they are involved) . this paper introduces a new approach to mixed-initiative clustering that handles several natural types of user-feedback . we first introduce a new probabilistic-generative-model for text-clustering (the speclustering model) and show that it outperforms the commonly used mixture-of-multinomials clustering-model , even when used in fully autonomous mode with no user-input . we then describe how to incorporate four distinct types of user-feedback into the clustering algorithm , and provide experimental-evidence showing substantial improvements in text-clustering when this user-feedback is incorporated .
