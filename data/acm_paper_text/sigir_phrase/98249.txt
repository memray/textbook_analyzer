parallel-text searching in serial files using a processor farm this paper discusses the implementation of a parallel-text retrieval-system using a microprocessor network . the system is designed to allow fast searching in document-databases organised using the serial file-structure , with a very rapid initial text signature search being followed by a more detailed , but more time-consuming , pattern-matching search . the network is built from transputers , high-performance microprocessors developed specifically for the construction of highly parallel-computing systems , which are linked together in a processor farm . the paper discusses the design and implementation of processor farms , and then reports our initial studies of the efficiency of searching that can be achieved using this approach to text-retrieval from serial files .
