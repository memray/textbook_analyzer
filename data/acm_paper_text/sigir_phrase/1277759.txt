learn from web-search-logs to organize search-results effective organization of search-results is critical for improving the utility of any search-engine . clustering search-results is an effective way to organize search-results , which allows a user to navigate into relevant documents quickly . however , two deficiencies of this approach make it not always work well : (1) the clusters discovered do not necessarily correspond to the interesting-aspects of a topic from the user 's perspective ; and (2) the cluster-labels generated are not informative enough to allow a user to identify the right cluster . in this paper , we propose to address these two deficiencies by (1) learning `` interesting-aspects '' of a topic from web-search-logs and organizing search-results accordingly ; and (2) generating more meaningful cluster-labels using past query words entered by users . we evaluate our proposed method on a commercial-search-engine log-data . compared with the traditional methods of clustering search-results , our method can give better result organization and more meaningful labels .
