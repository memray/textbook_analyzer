interesting nuggets and their impact on definitional-question-answering current approaches to identifying definitional sentences in the context of question-answering mainly involve the use of linguistic or syntactic-patterns to identify informative nuggets . this is insufficient as they do not address the novelty factor that a definitional nugget must also possess . this paper proposes to address the deficiency by building a `` human-interest model '' from external-knowledge . it is hoped that such a model will allow the computation of human-interest in the sentence with respect to the topic . we compare and contrast our model with current definitional-question-answering models to show that interestingness plays an important-factor in definitional-question-answering .
