context-sensitive-information-retrieval using implicit-feedback a major limitation of most existing retrieval-models and systems is that the retrieval decision is made based solely on the query and document collection ; information about the actual user and search-context is largely ignored . in this paper , we study how to exploit implicit-feedback-information , including previous queries and clickthrough information , to improve retrieval-accuracy in an interactive-information-retrieval setting . we propose several context-sensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical-language-models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents . we use the trec ap data to create a test-collection with search-context information , and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test-set . experiment results show that using implicit-feedback , especially the clicked document summaries , can improve retrieval-performance substantially .
