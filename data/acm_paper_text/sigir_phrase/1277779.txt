analyzing feature trajectories for event-detection we consider the problem of analyzing word trajectories in both time and frequency domains , with the specific goal of identifying important and less-reported , periodic and aperiodic words . a set of words with identical trends can be grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely un-supervised manner . the document frequency of each word across time is treated like a time-series , where each element is the document frequency - inverse-document-frequency (dfidf) score at one time point . in this paper , we 1) first applied spectral-analysis to categorize features for different event characteristics : important and less-reported , periodic and aperiodic ; 2) modeled aperiodic features with gaussian density and periodic features with gaussian-mixture densities , and subsequently detected each feature 's burst by the truncated gaussian approach ; 3) proposed an unsupervised greedy event-detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events . all of the above methods can be applied to time-series-data in general . we extensively evaluated our methods on the 1-year reuters news-corpus [3] and showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic and periodic events .
