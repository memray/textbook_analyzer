personalized query expansion for the-web the inherent ambiguity of short keyword-queries demands for enhanced methods for web-retrieval . in this paper we propose to improve such web-queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user 's personal-information repository , thus implicitly personalizing the search output . we introduce five broad techniques for generating the additional query keywords by analyzing user-data at increasing granularity-levels , ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence-statistics , as well as to using external thesauri . our extensive empirical-analysis under four different scenarios shows some of these approaches to perform very well , especially on ambiguous-queries , producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings . subsequently , we move this personalized-search framework one step further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to various features of each query . a separate set of experiments indicates the adaptive-algorithms to bring an additional statistically significant improvement over the best static expansion approach .
