knowledge-intensive conceptual retrieval and passage-extraction of biomedical-literature this paper presents a study of incorporating domain-specific-knowledge (i.e. , information about concepts and relationships between concepts in a certain domain) in an information-retrieval (ir) system to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical-literature . the effects of different types of domain-specific-knowledge in performance contribution are examined . based on the trec platform , we show that appropriate-use of domain-specific-knowledge in a proposed conceptual retrieval-model yields about 23 \ % improvement over the best reported result in passage-retrieval in the genomics track of trec 2006 .
