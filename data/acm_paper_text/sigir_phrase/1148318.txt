fact-focused novelty-detection : a feasibility study-methods for detecting sentences in an input document-set , which are both relevant and novel with respect to an information-need , would be of direct benefit to many systems , such as extractive text summarizers . however , satisfactory levels of agreement between judges performing this task manually have yet to demonstrated , leaving researchers to conclude that the task is too subjective . in previous experiments , judges were asked to first identify sentences that are relevant to a general topic , and then to eliminate sentences from the list that do not contain new information . currently , a new task is proposed , in which annotators perform the same procedure , but within the context of a specific , factual-information need . in the experiment , satisfactory levels of agreement between independent annotators were achieved on the first step of identifying sentences containing relevant-information relevant . however , the results indicate that judges do not agree on which sentences contain novel information .
