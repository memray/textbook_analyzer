implicit-user-modeling for personalized-search information-retrieval-systems (e.g. , web-search-engines) are critical for overcoming information-overload . a major deficiency of existing retrieval-systems is that they generally lack user-modeling and are not adaptive to individual users , resulting in inherently non-optimal retrieval-performance . for example , a tourist and a programmer may use the same word `` java '' to search for different information , but the current search systems would return the same results . in this paper , we study how to infer a user 's interest from the user 's search-context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized-search . we present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit-user-modeling in information-retrieval . we develop an intelligent client-side web-search agent (ucair) that can perform eager implicit-feedback , e.g. , query-expansion based on previous queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information . experiments on web-search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over the popular google-search-engine .
