a novel scheme for domain-transfer problem in the context of sentiment-analysis in this work , we attempt to tackle domain-transfer problem by combining old-domain labeled examples with new-domain unlabeled ones . the basic idea is to use old-domain-trained classifier to label some informative unlabeled-examples in new domain , and retrain the base classifier over these selected examples . the experimental-results demonstrate that proposed scheme can significantly boost the accuracy of the base sentiment classifier on new domain .
