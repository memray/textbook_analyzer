do they belong to the same class : active-learning by querying pairwise label-homogeneity traditional active-learning methods request experts to provide ground truths to the queried instances , which can be expensive in practice . an alternative solution is to ask nonexpert labelers to do such labeling work , which can not tell the definite class labels . in this paper , we propose a new active-learning-paradigm , in which a nonexpert labeler is only asked `` whether a pair of instances belong to the same class '' . to instantiate the proposed paradigm , we adopt the mincut algorithm as the base classifier . we first construct a graph-based on the pairwise distance of all the labeled and unlabeled instances and then repeatedly update the unlabeled edge weights on the max-flow paths in the graph . finally , we select an unlabeled subset of nodes with the highest prediction confidence as the labeled-data , which are included into the labeled-data set to learn a new classifier for the next round of active-learning . the experimental-results and comparisons , with state-of-the-art methods , demonstrate that our active-learning-paradigm can result in good performance with nonexpert labelers .
