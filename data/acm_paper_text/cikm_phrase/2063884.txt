automatic query reformulation with syntactic operators to alleviate search-difficulty modern search-engines usually provide a query-language with a set of advanced syntactic operators (e.g. , plus sign to require a term 's appearance , or quotation marks to require a phrase 's appearance) which if used appropriately , can significantly improve the effectiveness of a plain keyword-query . however , they are rarely used by ordinary-users due to the intrinsic difficulties and users ' lack of corpora statistics . in this paper , we propose to automatically reformulate queries that do not work well by selectively adding syntactic operators . particularly , we propose to perform syntactic operator-based query-reformulation when a retrieval-system detects users encounter difficulty in search as indicated by users ' behaviors such as scanning over top k documents without click-through . we frame the problem of automatic reformulation with syntactic operators as a supervised-learning-problem , and propose a set of effective features to represent queries with syntactic operators . experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and its applicability as a query-suggestion mechanism for search-engines . as a negative-feedback strategy , syntactic operator-based query-reformulation also shows promising results in improving search-results for difficult-queries as compared with existing methods .
