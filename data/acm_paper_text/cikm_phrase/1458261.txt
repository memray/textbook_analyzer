view and index-selection for query-performance improvement : quality-centered algorithms and heuristics selecting and precomputing indexes and materialized-views , with the goal of improving query-processing performance , is an important part of database-performance tuning . the significant complexity of the view - and index-selection problem may result in high total-cost-of-ownership for database-systems . in this paper , we develop efficient methods that deliver user-specified quality of the set of selected views and indexes when given view - and index-based plans as problem inputs . here , quality means proximity to the globally optimum performance for the input query workload given the input query plans . our experimental-results and comparisons on synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach and show that it provides a winning combination with end-to-end view - and index-selection frameworks such as those of [1 , 2] .
