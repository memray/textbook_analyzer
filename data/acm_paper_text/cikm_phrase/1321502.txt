semantic-components enhance retrieval of domain-specific documents we seek to leverage knowledge about information-organization in a domain to effectively and efficiently meet targeted information-needs of expert-users . the semantic components model represents document-content in a manner that is complementary to full text and keyword-indexing . semantic-component instances are segments of text about a particular aspect of the main topic of the document and may not correspond to structural elements in the document . this paper describes the semantic components model and presents experimental-evidence from a large interactive searching study showing that semantic-components , used to supplement full text and keyword-indexing and to extend the query-language , enhanced the retrieval of domain-specific documents in response to realistic queries posed by real-users .
