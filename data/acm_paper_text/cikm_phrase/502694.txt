a clustering-algorithm for asymmetrically related data with applications to text-mining clustering-techniques find a collection of subsets of a data-set such that the collection satisfies a criterion that is dependent on a relation defined on the data-set . the underlying relation is traditionally assumed to be symmetric . however , there exist many practical scenarios where the underlying relation is asymmetric . one example of an asymmetric relation in text-analysis is the inclusion relation , i.e. , the inclusion of the meaning of a block of text in the meaning of another block . in this paper , we consider the general problem of clustering of asymmetrically related data and propose an algorithm to cluster such data . to demonstrate its usefulness , we consider two applications in text-mining : (1) summarization of short documents , and (2) generation of a concept-hierarchy from a set of documents . our experiments show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of more traditional algorithms .
