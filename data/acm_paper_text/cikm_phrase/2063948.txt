lsh_based outlier-detection and its application in distributed setting in this paper , we give an approximate-algorithm for distance_based outlier-detection using locality-sensitive-hashing (lsh) technique . we propose an algorithm for the centralized case wherein the entire dataset is locally available for processing . however , in case of very-large datasets collected from various input sources , often the data is distributed across the network . accordingly , we show that our algorithm can be effectively extended to a constant round protocol with low communication-costs , in a distributed setting with horizontal partitioning .
