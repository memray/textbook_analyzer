a dictionary for approximate-string-search and longest prefix search in this paper we propose a dictionary-data structure for string search with errors where the query string may didiffer from the expected matching string by a few edits . this data-structure can also be used to find the database string with the longest common prefix with few errors . specifically , with a database of n random strings , each of length of o (m) , we show how to perform string search on a query string that differs from its closest match by k edits using a data-structure of linear size and query time equal to (log n 2 log n k log a 2 m over 2 m) . this means that if k < m over log a 2 m log n , then the query time is (1) . this is of significant in practice as there are several applications where k is small relative to m . our approach converts strings into bit-vectors so that similar strings can map to similar bit-vectors with small hamming-distance . a simple reduction can be used to obtain similar results for approximate longest prefix search .
