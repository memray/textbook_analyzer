person-resolution in person-search results : webhawk finding information about people on the web using a search-engine is difficult because there is a many-to-many-mapping between person-names and specific persons (i.e. referents) . this paper describes a person-resolution system , called webhawk . given a list of pages obtained by submitting a person query to a search-engine , webhawk facilitates person-search in three steps : first of all , a filter removes those pages that contain no information about any person . secondly , a cluster groups the remaining pages into different clusters , each for one specific person . to make the resulting clusters more meaningful , an extractor is used to induce query-oriented personal-information from each page . finally , a namer generates an informative description for each cluster so that users can find any specific person easily . the architecture of webhawk is presented , and the four components are discussed in detail , with a separate evaluation of each component presented where appropriate . a user-study shows that webhawk complements most existing search-engines and successfully improves users ' experience of person-search on the web .
