unified utility-maximization framework for resource selection this paper presents a unified utility framework for resource selection of distributed text information-retrieval . this new framework shows an efficient and effective way to infer the probabilities of relevance of all the documents across the text-databases . with the estimated relevance information , resource-selection can be made by explicitly optimizing the goals of different applications . specifically , when used for database recommendation , the selection is optimized for the goal of high-recall (include as many relevant documents as possible in the selected databases) ; when used for distributed document-retrieval , the selection targets the high-precision goal (high precision in the final merged list of documents) . this new model provides a more solid framework for distributed-information-retrieval . empirical-studies show that it is at least as effective as other state-of-the-art algorithms .
