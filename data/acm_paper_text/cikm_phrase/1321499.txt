clustering for unsupervised-relation-identification unsupervised-relation-identification is the task of automatically discovering interesting relations between entities in a large-text-corpora . relations are identified by clustering the frequently co-occurring pairs of entities in such a way that pairs occurring in similar contexts end up belonging to the same clusters . in this paper we compare several clustering setups , some of them novel and others already tried . the setups include feature-extraction-and-selection methods and clustering-algorithms . in order to do the comparison , we develop a clustering-evaluation metric , specifically adapted for the relation identification-task . our experiments demonstrate significant superiority of the single-linkage hierarchical-clustering with the novel threshold-selection technique over the other tested clustering-algorithms . also , the experiments indicate that for successful relation-identification it is important to use rich complex features of two kinds : features that test both relation slots together (`` relation features '') , and features that test only one slot each (`` entity features '') . we have found that using both kinds of features with the best of the algorithms produces very high-precision results , significantly improving over the previous work .
