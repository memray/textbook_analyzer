ranking web-objects from multiple communities vertical-search is a promising direction as it leverages domain-specific-knowledge and can provide more precise information for users . in this paper , we study the-web object-ranking problem , one of the key issues in building a vertical-search-engine . more specifically , we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different web-communities , and take high-quality-photo search as the test-bed for this investigation . we proposed two score-fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many web-communities (web-forums) with rating information as possible . the proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection-algorithm , and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums . both intermediate results and user-studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to web-object ranking in cases we have described . though the experiments were conducted on high-quality-photo ranking , the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems , such as movie ranking and music ranking .
