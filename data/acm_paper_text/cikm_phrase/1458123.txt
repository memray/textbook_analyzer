link-privacy in social-networks we consider a privacy threat to a social-network in which the goal of an attacker is to obtain knowledge of a significant fraction of the links in the network . we formalize the typical social-network interface and the information about links that it provides to its users in terms of lookahead . we consider a particular threat where an attacker subverts user accounts to get information about local neighborhoods in the network and pieces them together in order to get a global picture . we analyze , both experimentally and theoretically , the number of user accounts an attacker would need to subvert for a successful attack , as a function of his strategy for choosing users whose accounts to subvert and a function of lookahead provided by the network . we conclude that such an attack is feasible in practice , and thus any social-network that wishes to protect the link-privacy of its users should take great care in choosing the lookahead of its interface , limiting it to 1 or 2 , whenever possible .
