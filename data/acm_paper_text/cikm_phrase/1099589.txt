exploiting redundancy in sensor-networks for energy-efficient processing of spatiotemporal region queries sensor-networks are made of autonomous devices that are able to collect , store , process and share data with other devices . spatiotemporal region queries can be used for retrieving information of interest from such networks . such queries require the answers only from the subset of the network-nodes that fall into the query region . if the network is redundant in the sense that the measurements of some nodes can be substituted by those of other nodes with a certain degree of confidence , then a much smaller subset of nodes may be sufficient to answer the query at a lower energy-cost . we investigate how to take advantage of such data-redundancy and propose two techniques to process spatiotemporal region queries under these conditions . our techniques reduce up to twenty times the energy-cost of query-processing compared to the typical network flooding , thus prolonging the lifetime of the sensor-network .
