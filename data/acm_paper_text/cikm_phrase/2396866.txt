back to the roots : a probabilistic-framework for query-performance-prediction the query-performance-prediction task is estimating the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query when no relevance-judgments are available . although there exist many effective prediction methods , these differ substantially in their basic principles , and rely on diverse hypotheses about the characteristics of effective retrieval . we present a novel fundamental probabilistic-prediction framework . using the framework , we derive and explain various previously proposed prediction methods that might seem completely different , but turn out to share the same formal basis . the derivations provide new perspectives on several predictors (e.g. , clarity) . the framework is also used to devise new prediction approaches that outperform the state-of-the-art .
