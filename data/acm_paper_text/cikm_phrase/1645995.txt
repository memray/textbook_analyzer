efficient-algorithms for approximate-member-extraction using signature-based inverted-lists we study the problem of approximate membership extraction (ame) , i.e. , how to efficiently extract substrings in a text-document that approximately match some strings in a given dictionary . this problem is important in a variety of applications such as named-entity-recognition and data-cleaning . we solve this problem in two steps . in the first step , for each substring in the text , we filter away the strings in the dictionary that are very different from the substring . in the second step , each candidate string is verified to decide whether the substring should be extracted . we develop an incremental-algorithm using signature-based inverted-lists to minimize the duplicate list-scan operations of overlapping-windows in the text . our experimental-study of the proposed algorithms on real and synthetic datasets showed that our solutions significantly outperform existing methods in the literature .
