on domain similarity and effectiveness of adapting-to-rank adapting to rank address the problem of insufficient domain-specific labeled-training-data in learning-to-rank . however , the initial study shows that adaptation is not always effective . in this paper , we investigate the relationship between the domain similarity and the effectiveness of domain-adaptation with the help of two domain similarity-measure : relevance correlation and sample distribution correlation .
