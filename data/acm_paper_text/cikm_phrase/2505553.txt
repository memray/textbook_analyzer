a two-phase algorithm for mining-sequential-patterns with differential-privacy frequent sequential pattern-mining is a central task in many fields such as biology and finance . however , release of these patterns is raising increasing concerns on individual-privacy . in this paper , we study the sequential-pattern-mining problem under the differential-privacy framework which provides formal and provable guarantees of privacy . due to the nature of the differential-privacy mechanism which perturbs the frequency results with noise , and the high-dimensionality of the pattern space , this mining problem is particularly challenging . in this work , we propose a novel two-phase algorithm for mining both prefixes and substring patterns . in the first phase , our approach takes advantage of the statistical-properties of the data to construct a model-based prefix-tree which is used to mine prefixes and a candidate-set of substring patterns . the frequency of the substring patterns is further refined in the successive phase where we employ a novel transformation of the original data to reduce the perturbation noise . extensive experiment results using real datasets showed that our approach is effective for mining both substring and prefix patterns in comparison to the state-of-the-art solutions .
