event threading within news topics with the overwhelming volume of online-news available today , there is an increasing need for automatic techniques to analyze and present news to the user in a meaningful and efficient manner . previous research focused only on organizing news stories by their topics into a flat hierarchy . we believe viewing a news topic as a flat collection of stories is too restrictive and inefficient for a user to understand the topic quickly . in this work , we attempt to capture the rich structure of events and their dependencies in a news topic through our event-models . we call the process of recognizing events and their dependencies <i> event threading </i> . we believe our perspective of modeling the structure of a topic is more effective in capturing its semantics than a flat list of on-topic stories . we formally define the novel problem , suggest evaluation-metrics and present a few techniques for solving the problem . besides the standard word_based features , our approaches take into account novel features such as temporal-locality of stories for event-recognition and time-ordering for capturing dependencies . our experiments on a manually labeled-data sets show that our models effectively identify the events and capture dependencies among them .
