text vs. space : efficient geo-search query-processing many web-search services allow users to constrain text queries to a geographic-location (e.g. , yoga classes near santa monica) . important examples include local-search engines such as google local and location-based-search services for smart-phones . several research groups have studied the efficient execution of queries mixing text and geography ; their approaches usually combine inverted-lists with a spatial-access-method such as an r-tree or space-filling curve . in this paper , we take a fresh look at this problem . we feel that previous work has often focused on the spatial aspect at the expense of performance considerations in text-processing , such as inverted-index access , compression , and caching . we describe new and existing approaches and discuss their different perspectives . we then compare their performance in extensive experiments on large document collections . our results indicate that a query-processor that combines state-of-the-art text-processing techniques with a simple coarse-grained spatial-structure can outperform existing approaches by up to two orders of magnitude . in fact , even a naive approach that first uses a simple inverted-index and then filters out any documents outside the query range outperforms many previous methods .
