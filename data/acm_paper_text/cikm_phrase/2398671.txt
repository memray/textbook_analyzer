enhancing product-search by best-selling prediction in e-commerce with the rapid growth of e-commerce on the internet , online product search-service has emerged as a popular and effective paradigm for customers to find desired products and select transactions . most product-search engines today are based on adaptations of relevance-models devised for information-retrieval . however , there is still a big gap between the mechanism of finding products that customers really desire to purchase and that of retrieving products of high relevance to customers ' query . in this paper , we address this problem by proposing a new ranking framework for enhancing product-search based on dynamic best-selling prediction in e-commerce . specifically , we first develop an effective algorithm to predict the dynamic best-selling , i.e. the volume of sales , for each product item based on its transaction history . by incorporating such best-selling prediction with relevance , we propose a new ranking-model for product-search , in which we rank higher the product items that are not only relevant to the customer 's need but with higher probability to be purchased by the customer . results of a large-scale evaluation , conducted over the dataset from a commercial product-search engine , demonstrate that our new ranking-method is more effective for locating those product items that customers really desire to buy at higher rank positions without hurting the search-relevance .
