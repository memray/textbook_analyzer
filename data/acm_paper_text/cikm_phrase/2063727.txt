language-independent sentiment-classification using three common words many methods for cross-lingual processing-tasks are resource-dependent , which will not work without machine-translation-system or bilingual-lexicon . in this paper , we propose a novel approach for multilingual-sentiment-classification just by few seed-words . for a given language , the proposed approach learns a sentiment classifier from the initial seed-words instead of any labeled-data . we employ our method both in supervised-learning and unsupervised-learning . experimental-results demonstrate that our method relies less on external resource but performs as well as or better than the baseline .
